<h3>Multialgebras, Power Algebs and Complete Calculi of Identities and 
Inclusions</h3>
<b>Abstract:</b> After motivating the introduction of  nondeterministic
operators into algebraic specifications, a language L with two
primitive predicates, identity and inclusion, for specifying
nondeterministic operations is introduced. It is given a
multialgebraic semantics which captures the singular
(call-time-choice) strategy of passing nondeterministic parameters. A
calculus NEQ, with restricted substitutivity rules, is introduced. NEQ
is sound and complete wrt. the multialgebraic semantics. 
<P>
A language L+ is obtained by a slight modification of L admitting
plural (run-time-choice) parameters. The multialgebraic semantics is
not sufficient for modeling such parameters and it is generalized to
power algebras. Augmenting NEQ with one rule for unrestricted
substitutivity for the plural variables yields NEQ+ which is sound and
complete wrt. to the power algebra semantics. 
<P>
In the conclusion, we point out that the singular-plural distinction has
two, relatively indepdent facets. It may be applied to the semantics of 
parameter passing but may also be restricted to the kinds of variables used in
the specification language. The latter increases the expressiveness of the
language even if one applies only the singular semantics of parameter
passing.
