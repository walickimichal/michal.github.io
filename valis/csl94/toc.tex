\begin{document}

The 1994 {\em Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic, CSL'94\/} was held in Kazimierz (Poland) from September 25 through September 30 , 1994. CSL'94 was the eighth in the series of workshops and the third to be held as the Annual Conference of the European Association for Computer Science Logic. 

The workshop was attended by 100 participants from over 15 countries. Invited lectures were given by M.~Ajtai, M.~Baaz, H.~Barendregt, J.-P.~Jouannaud, V.~Orevkov, P.~Pudlak, and A.~Tarlecki. Moreover, 39 contributed talks selected from 151 submissions were presented. The selection and nomination of invited speakers was done by the Program Committee consisting of E.~B\"orger, M.~Dezani, N.~Jones, P.~Kolaitis, J.~Krajicek, J.-L.~Krivine, L.~Pacholski, A.~Pitts, A.~Razborov, and \linebreak J.~Tiuryn (Chair). We would like to express our gratitude to the Program Committee for time and effort they contributed to the task of selecting the best papers from the unexpectedly large number of submissions. We are also thankful to over 200 subreferees who have helped the program committee.

The conference was organized by Warsaw University. We would like very much to thank Dr. Igor Walukiewicz for the splendid work he has contributed to the success of the meeting. Special thanks go to R.~Maron and A.~Schubert for their help with organizing and running the conference office. We also wish to thank to M.~Benke and G.~Grudzi\'nski for taking care of the computers used during the conference.

We gratefully acknowledge the generous sponsorship by the following institutions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Office of Naval Research, under the Grant Number N00014-94-J9001 \item
%Polish State Research Granting Agency (KBN), Polish Committee for Scientific Research (KBN), \item Warsaw University
\item Wroc\l aw University
\item Mathematical Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences \end{itemize}

Due to the financial support of ONR and KBN we were able to offer a number of grants for participants who otherwise would not afford to come to the conference.

The topics covered by the talks at the conference addressed all important aspects of the methods of mathematical logic in computer science: finite model theory, lambda calculus, type theory, modal logics, non-monotonic reasoning, decidability problems, as well as inter-play between complexity theory and logic. 

The order of the papers in the proceedings, unlike in the previous ones, follows more closely the order they were presented during the conference and they are grouped according to the subjects. 

Following the traditional procedure for CSL volumes, papers were collected after the presentation at the conference and after a regular reviewing process 38 papers have been selected for publication. We thank the referees of the final versions. Without them it would have been impossible to prepare this volume. Finally, we would like to thank W.~Charatonik for his help in collecting the papers for the proceedings.
