\section{A Few Conclusions}\subsection{generals...}\pa We have heard.God is dead!  Subject is dead!  Representational thinking is dead! Metaphysics is dead!  And philosophy is dying dissolving in the interminableanalyses of scattered thoughts.  Does not our culture,and philosophical understanding in particular, become all toooverfilled cementeries?Perhaps a bit surpirsingly, \thi{philosophers} themselves seemquite alive, although some dared to warn even them:\citet{the end of the philosophers who did not honor God wasnothing other than to perish in their vanities.}{SeekGod}{ III:40} Too manydeaths in vicinity may eventually affect the landlord, too.But are we not all too fast in conflating the death of ourmisunderstandings with the death of the things themselves?  Do we not,in all the hullabaloo about the power of language and its identity with reality, forgetthe persistent and insistent presence of some fundamental words whichirresponsibly refuse to die; the refusal which then should mean thatthe reality of these words, after all, has not died either?  For mypart, I have seen many terror acts, many an attempt of assasination,some fewer attempts of open killing (even with a hammer!) but, as yet,no actual casualty.  Can it be, perhaps, because I do not follow thenews?  Or is it because I did not study thoroughly enough, did not paysufficient attention to the subtle distinctions which, in fact, makethe whole difference? \pa Deaths of idols shatter the foundations but do not affect theorigin. God, or let's just say, the ultimatereality of the invisible origin, is not merely something to be leftfor abstract considerations, even if words of a textcan never do much more then, communicating such abstractions, suggest that there is something beyond them.  It is, infact, the most immanently present element of life which not only doesnot contradict its concreteness but, in fact, is its veryfoundation. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, this concreteness can be foundonly by an individual, everybody has to find it anew himself -- when lifted tothe level of socio-cultural phenomena it is bound to dissolve, especially whenthese are almost by definition dissociated from the religious dimension ofcultural life. And neglecting or just missing this presence, all thesearch for the concrete facts of actual life finds only sterileproducts of its own conceptions. %This presence has always found an expression in human being and %conduct of human affairs, as well as in language.Neglecting it, we simply reduce the sphere of our experience. Pretending that itis not there, or else that it {\em really} is something different, perhapssimple, perhaps complicated, but explicable and possible to grasp in theplainly visible concepts and categories, is to thoroughly falsify this presence, is toveil and confuse the quality of its experience. The greatest sins againsthumanity are comitted in the name of humanity. And likewise, the greatestmistakes are comitted in the search of truth.%It seems that all the casualties were announced with reference to theculture, by sociologists or philosophers with a strong sense of the cultural, ifnot directly sociological context. Eventually, even existentialism turned out to benothing but an expression of a time of depersonalization and destabilization...Strangely enough, we have been so infected by historicism that one can hardlyimagine that a philosopher is anything more than an expression of his times,that the world has been old since its beginning.\noo{\la{Mundus senescit},  \wo{The world has aged}, says Gregory of Tours in the VI-th century, and  likewise, some 1000-1500 years before him, the preacher observes: \citefi{The    thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is    that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.}{ Eccl.}{    I:9}} Our exposition may seem rather antique and certainly out of touch with\thi{our times}, with \thi{our historical context}, with \thi{our current  issues}.  But strangely enough, surrounded by all that is \thi{ours} andspecific to \thi{our times} (and such \thi{ours} involve always the element of\thi{{\em only} ours}), we still happen to read Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato,Bible, Vedas... The celebrated historicism suffers from a thoroughly false senseof history. Only superficiality viewing history as a mere progress can restrictitself to what has been and no longer is and to what is now but has not beenbefore. If the sway of history were so total, there would be no history but onlythe current now, the mere actuality, dissociated from the incommensurable past.The mere fact that we can understand somethig from the writings of Herodotus,Caesar or Josephus Flavius is itself the evidence that, all social andtechnological changes notwithstanding, not everything is so completely new. Underneath all social systems, behind all the differences of habits, customs andnorms, throughout all the historical epochs, one can not fail to discern everthe same aspects of human existence. That is, one can not fail unless all onedoes is trying to catch up with one's time.   \pa But was {\em this} a philosophy?  Hardly, with all these mystics,quotations from the Scriptures, with God, or rather only some one. Theology then?  Not really, for would it be Protestant or Catholic? Hardly {\em any} orthodoxy to attach it to.  A mystical hymn?  A tribute tolife, the {\em whole} life?\noo{I am,indeed, after the mystical value and quality of life, of {\em whole}life, might it never find definite expression in an actual experience. But no, too many concepts and too little of particular way, advice.  Whatis it then?}  Perhaps, just an ecclectic collection, a bit of everything? Perhaps.  It is, in fact, entirely up to you to decide.   %\noo{ I am not amystic.  \wo{Mystical} are called \citt{those supernatural acts orstates which no effort or labour on our part can succeed in producing,even in the slightest degree or for a single instant.}{CatholicEncyclopedia} I am not after any \thi{acts or states}, I am not afterany form of -- be it incomplete or complete, full, exstatic ordeifying -- union.  The absence of anything about the transition from\sch\ to actual \co{incarnation} of \co{love} should indicate clearlythat, even if I have my ways, I do not consider them to be of anygeneral interest.  }%\noo{\pa God, misconstrued as a deistic concept, as the First Cause of allthe calamities of this world, as a potent, all controlling boss is,indeed, dead.  (But was he ever alive?)  God who has no relevance forhuman life is, fortunately, dead.The subject, the petty Ego, or else the subject as the alldetermining and self-constituting axis of the world is dead, too.  Thesubject, whose transcendental omnipotence or else rational impotencelost all contact with the actual experience of subjectivity is,fortunately, dead.Philosophy based on such concepts, philosophy without least appeal tohuman reality is also dead.  Cross over its grave and solemn Amen.\pa Consequently, the subject, the {\em human} subject, too, is prettyalive, even if vastly confused and not quite well.  Deaths of idolsshatter the foundations but do not affect the origin.  Open Jung onalmost any page and you will read about the inflation of such asubject which is swallowed by the confrontation with the archetype;the inflation, however, which is exclusively the result of subject'sinability to cope, its inability to integrate the contents ofexperience it can not control.  Confrontation with chaos, if it is notto end in cacophonic confusion, babbling and, sometimes, insanity,requires an attitude -- a mere description does not help the least anymore, because the event brings man face to face with his Self.  It isthe most concrete, the most personal event which has been lived bynumberless persons since the dawn of humanity.  \citt{Although theaccount is common, most men live as if they had a privateunderstanding.}{Heraclitus, B2 [This may, and probably does, refer tothe patheistic ever-living fire, rather than human \thi{account}.]} Inthe current philosophical context, this only means the final, healthydeath of the idol of scientism, {\em pseudo}-rationalism andimpersonal objectivism.  Death which, starting with Nietzsche andKierkegaard, has taken some 100 years.  The worthy work ofdeconstruction has been carried to its successful end, even if formany deconstructionists themselves it is still unclear what exactlyhas been deconstructed, and even less clear what possibly might beconstructed from the scattered pieces of the dismembered corpse.}%If philosophy is \thi{love of wisdom}, then itdoes not live up to its name by glossing over the fundamental aspectsof human life in order to deal with more palpable and pettymatters of most actual problems.  In fact, by such a glossing over, byinsisting on some undefinable \thi{reason} with its capacity fordefinitions, %(which \thi{reason}, by the way, is much more mysterious%entity than the invisible presence) it ceases to be philosophy andbecomes a \ldots science?  a field for academic dispute?  a referenceframe for quarrels, that is, \thi{rational} discourse?%\citet{A quarrel between philosophers should be taken as seriously as a philosophical argument between two bricklayers.}{SisterI}{ IV:39} %Shall we dare to say that, as a matter of %fact, it actually {\em is} taken as seriously by all, also %philosophers, except the quarreling ones \ldots \sepWe have heard that: from neoplatonism, through Greek Fathers (and heresiarches),through Eckhart and Suso, Molinos and their pietistic counterparts..., it leadsto subjectivism and quietism, to mere internal development in alienation fromthe others and even from the Church...\noo{We said that it is not a book for everybody. Perhaps even it is only book forsome less healthy ones, who are no longer able to rest satsfied with the averageamount of direction and advice, buit need a more personal relation to that whichunderlies also the common truth of the church.}We recognize indispensability of \co{visible} means and signs as we claim theco-presence of all levels of Being in every \co{existence}. Nobody can docompletely without any of them, but some will need or emphasize one more thanother. Indispensability does not mean primacy and we are merely maintaining thatthe higher and deeper things allow quite a freedom among the lower ones. \subsection{Directions...tactless}\paSo it was yet another tactless attempt to tell others how to live...?  But whatmakes such attempts tactless? The imputed sense of superiority, I assume. Butsuperiority is tactless only for one who feels inferior, who meeting any clearsuggestion or command, shrinks immediately into his own defensive insecurity.Inferiority, just like \citet{shame is pride's cloke.}{BlakeMarr}{ Proverbs ofhell \citaft{EvilFaces}{, p.201}} A healthy (and this means, \co{open} and\co{humble}) man meets only his equals -- superiority may only concern this orthat \co{aspect}, but never the value of the whole person.So, perhaps, it is tactless because the ability is always assumed but never justified,because as a matter of fact nobody actually can tell anybody anything meaningfulabout life. I leave this assumptions to those who want to insist on thetactlessness of my enterprise.It seems to me that philosophy is worth only as much as it tells something aboutlife, as it is existentially relevant. But telling anything about life can onlyin special cases be distinguished from telling how to live. (The special casesare exactly all the uninteresting ones, for instance biology, but also sociologyor psychology -- all more or less failed attempts at getting scientific aboutlife.) There is however a difference between telling how to live and preaching,and I hope that I did not overstepped the border between these two. A preacheradmonishes, lists the reasons and tries to convince, himself convinced (orperhaps not?) that he possesses all the sufficient reasons for hisadmonishons. Telling how to live may be preaching, but hopefully it may also beshowing images -- not proofs but images, not sufficient but necessaryreasons, not forcing arguments but appealing stories\pa On the other hand, one might perhaps hear: \citet{\ `But give me  directions.' Why should I give you directions? has not Zeus given you directions?}{Epictet}{ I:25}Imprecise, avoiding many crucial problems -- that is, idstinctions. Indeed...We do not, peopleknow how to run their lifes and arrange all the details. Looking for detailedplans for ethical etc. acting in all situations is as ridiculuous as it is pettyburgeoise...\pa\Yes-\No\ -- isn't it an abstract, in any case exaggerated opposition? Mostpeople are somewhere inbetween. So what is it good for?These are not abstract impossibilities! We do describe but, indeed, we do notcare about numbers and statistics -- they do not count! The extreme alternativesmay look improbable, but they are possible. The fact that only few personsrealize them in such an extreme degree does not deprive them of any reality...They are the eternal dimensions of every human existence...Desiring good, \co{actually} willing it is only a \co{reflection} of the genuinegoodness, a \co{concrete} expression of the ontological \co{founding} in the\co{origin}. But it has few specific rules which could be formulated once andapplied everywhere. In the last instance, most things belong on the context --the only thing which need not is the genuine desire of good. Abstract andcontentless as it may sound, it is in fact the most \co{concrete} possibility of\co{existence} because it is not the mere \co{actual} declaration of a voluntaryintention, but the admission of one's own insufficiency and fallibility. In more\co{precise} terms, it for the most means only: try to avoid evil...Avoiding evils is more difficult than one would expect... \citt{If a man shuns  them when he sees them from afar, before he is entangled in them, it is by  God's wisdom and forethought that he is protected from them}{Hermetica,  (ascribed to) Hermes Trismegistus, Letter II to Asclepius [The Many Faces of  Evil, p.24]} In fact, man can shun them also when he does not see them, thoughthis shunning may be simply the fear -- one would say, irrational and ungrounded-- of getting caught and entangled by them...\noo{We do not defend irrationalism, but we do not deify reason either. In ourhierarchy reason is -- if we identify it with the reflective analysis, the levelof actuality and immediacy -- the lowest stage, furthest removed from the divineorigin. We thus do oppose all rational totalitarianism which, starting withAristotles, if not Plato, has been polluting most of philosophy claiming thatcontemplation and, in fact, thinking, dwelling on concepts and ideas, brings onecloser to God or, as those who think they can do without wish, happiness. Theusual tendency is rather the opposite, and we point out that it is not only due to misunderstanding but alsodue to the nature of conceptual reasoning as ... exactly the remotest from theorigin -- remotest, but the mere immediacy -- layer of Being. But we do not just throwreason away, together with the thinking subject, and what not. On the contrary,we recognize its indispensability and also its useful function. We onlyemphasize that this function and indispensability have virtually no existentialrelevance.}% It is misunderstood individualism of protestant falvour that some matters are of% purely private character and that their public discussion is an offence, shame. \subsection{???}\paBook I descended in the order of ontological founding; Book II ascendend in away analogous to neoplatonic ascent, although in a less mysticalmanner. But admiring the neoplatonic games of negativity, we find the idea ofascent an incomplete truth.  For true return is not the return to the \co{origin} but {\em from} it, thereturn from the mount Carmel down to earth. As already Trismegistus taught, the soul's ascent must be followed by the renewed descendback to the world it has left. And so, admiringCusanus and his reinterpretation of Psudo-Dionysius, we can not quite accept thescepticism towards the idea of analogy which is one of the most genuinephilosophical reflections of this ancient insight.\footnote{J.~Hopkins comments  on Cusanus' dislike of \thi{analogy} in the    introduction  to his edition of De docta ignorantia, The Arthur J. Banning  Press, Minneapolis, 1981 [after Bog-Nicosc, J.Miernowski, p.68[ftnt.31]]} \co{Concrete founding}, is analogy re-cast in our existential context or, if oneprefers, the ultimate return from Hell and Heaven to Earth, where is our place. \paOur insistence on the fact that \co{I am not the master} might give someassociations with what nowadays goes under the name of the \wo{postmodern} turn to the other,otherness, (\citt{The real face of postmodernity ... is the face of the  other}{D. Tracy, Theology and the Many Faces of Postmodernity, in Theology  Today, vol.~51, no.~1, April 1994}) We certainly would not like to beassociated with this word which carries a lot of other connotations (no punintended -- what for?). But in this respect, there seems to be a point ofagreement, albeit a very slight one. Subject, this epitome of modernintyaccording to the preachers of the postmodern gospel, is equally central in ourexposition and, we would maintain, ineradicable. \wo{One may believe that the  original time is ecstatic, yet one buys oneself a watch.} We may maintain thatthe depth of our being hides \co{invisible} powers which never become\co{actual}, and yet we may still insist on the necessity of remaining a sobersubject occupied with the \co{actual} tasks and problems....The otherness of postmoders makes an impression of the Cartesian stick which onebends unreasonably far to the left, only because before it was bent unreasonablyfar to the right. But to at all confront otherness, there must be somebody doingthat, and dissolution of a subject (or as we'd rather say, of a person)eradicates otherness as well -- without the same, there is no other. The attempts to posit otherness as the new site of true substantiality (thelanguage is, of course, very different, but it is the role of otherness),square very badly with the proclaimed dissolution of all substantiality, allidentity. Of course, nobody wants to keep the identity modeled in the\co{objective} manner of \co{actual objects} and things. But relativity of suchan identity has been a fact for quite a while. It does not, however, make itunreal or unnecessary (it always will be) -- only relative. \noo{\pa Perhaps, it becomes a method?  I guess, one could abstract aspectseven of this work and try to call them a \wo{method}. The overall intuition is that it is not true that \citt{the only way to mediate between diversity and unity is to class the diverse items as cases of a common essence which you discover in them.}{W. James, Essays in Pragmatism, I. The Sentiment of Rationality, p.6} On the contrary, unity is only expression of \co{virtual} orgin\ldots\begin{enumerate}\item Identify \equi\ \co{aspects} -- things which not necessarily,but factually, form a \nexus\ and can not be dissociated from eachother \\ \thi{being an \co{aspect} of} is, often, a symmetricrelation!  -- sometimes, we may have a word for the\nexus, the unity of \co{aspects}, and then the relation isasymmetric.  \\distinctions arising from a \nexus\ are `circular' [I said to say it somewhere]%\item Identify how new \co{aspects} emerge from thenucleus of earlier ones \\ Many \thi{natural}, \thi{common sense}concepts -- given by limits, perhaps at different levels %\item \thi{inversions}\itemNo sufficient conditions/reasons, only necessary ones \ldots\itemEverything belongs to one of four (perhaps more) levels. Elements of existential relevance can be usually viewed from any of them.\\It is only at the highest level that all such elements may form a unity.\end{enumerate}But all this is no method -- it is just because we see everything as \co{founded} on the \co{virtuality} of the \co{origin}. I find this way of thinking not only helpful but also gratifying. %But I would be as vastly surprised if everybody else did, as I would%be pleased if at least some did.\thi{Method} is but a reflection of some form of understanding, a wayof expression and organization of {\em this} understanding. But understanding only seldom, and deep, genuine understanding never results from an applicationof any \thi{method}.} %\end \noo{...%\tit{Rationalism}\pa Yeah\ldots Meaning what?  If sufficient reasons,then I am certainly out in the blue of irrationality.  But, but! There need be no conflict with anything written here, if only we takerationalism in a bit more generous sense of \thi{knowing thateverything has limits of its validity} and, in some cases,\thi{knowing where such limits go}\ldots It has little to do withcausality, resons, and nothing with sufficient reasons which simply donot obtain, except in the narrow sphere of actual experimentation. I know people who do not like me.  They are stupid! -- I am quitelikeable and friendly guy.  But do not they have reasons for notliking me?  Sure they do \ldots only that these are not {\em good}reasons.  If we reduce rationality to reasons, then everybody isrational; if to sufficient reasons, then nobody is. And so, \thi{rationalists} keep trying to say what should and what should not count as \thi{good} reasons. One may certainly try to narrow down the notion of rationalism, make it so precise thatit comes into conflict with everything one does not like, but are weimpressed by such attempts at essentialistic definitions?  Rationalismhas only to do with reason's finitude, i.e., its partiality,\la{ratio}, which means simply a slight \ldots humility.The most rational attitude is not to absolutize thispartiality, not to relay unreservedly on one's reason, that is, onone's finite and explicit understanding as the only source ofjudgments and actions. For there is no such thing as \thi{good reasons} {\em in general}, \la{in abstracto}, albeit there may be many goo dreasons in any particular situation. \citt{[I]t is well to acknowledge the demonsformally only when reason dictates, and reason may not dictate ourdoing so in every case.}{Celsus, On the True Doctrine, X[reconstructed translation by R.J.Hoffmann]} Isn't it a perfectlyrational statement?  Sure, dealing with matters \thi{rationalism}would most gladly label \wo{irrational}? But he explicitly links them to the judgment of reason. Was his reason {\em so} different from mine? Do you really mean thatdemons are unreal?  Because they are \thi{projections} of a\thi{subjective psyche} not worth rational attention?  That, instead, we have obsessions, suggestions,projections, mental disorders, schizophrenia, pathologicaldepressions, neuroses, crowd hysterias, and what not.  We have as much\thi{belief}, or \thi{disbelief}, in therapy, as primitives had intheir shamans and medicine-men; statistically, there is probablylittle difference either with respect to \thi{beliefs} or to theresults of treatement.  The main difference is that we are doing it\thi{rationally}; another, that a bushman who \thi{lost his soul} wasterrified, while a person labelled with a diagnosis becomes pacified. Less violent outbursts? Even if, violence went somewhere else, but it still stays with us. Surely, there must be some limits to the irrationality of\thi{rationalism}.  The creed of our rationalism would be:%\begin{quote}to accept any statement or position admitting only itslimited validity (and, whenever possible, recognizing also its actuallimits) -- and this is self-applicable, i.e., even this very statementhas only limited validity.  \end{quote}%Rationalist can always only say \wo{I mean this but I may be wrong.}Yet, it is one of the most common and prevalent need \thi{to be right}-- no \thi{rationalist} ever managed to avoid falling prey to it, forhe gets scared by the arbitrariness and relativism inherent in hischoice of what counts as \thi{good reasons}.  And the more absolutelyright and \thi{rational} I am trying to be about something about whichI may be wrong, the more absolutely wrong I am -- worshipping idols Ihave created.The limit of rationalism is the sphere of the \co{spiritual} relationto the \co{indistinct absolute}, to \co{nothingness}.  It is notopposed to empiricism, albeit empiricism devoid of its ultimate atoms;it is not opposed to pragmaticism (this American variant of German phenomenology), albeit pragmatism extended with the{\em constant} reference to the unity of human life; itcherishes varieties of religious experience, but not only as somealternative scattered bits and pieces but as so many unavoidablydifferent concrete realizations of the same.  It is not opposed toPlatonism, albeit Platonism with ideas clearly separated from conceptsand abstract universals.  It is not even opposed to psychoanalysis,albeit only its Jungian version.  It is not opposed to theology,albeit theology in the generous sense of interest in and fundamentalrelevance of matters of spirit, which are the same as the matters ofhuman relations to the invisible Godhead.  If all these \thi{albeit}seem all too grevious, then it is indeed opposed to all.  But in factit is opposed only to narrow-minded \thi{rationalism} which,distributing the labels \wo{rational} and \wo{irrational}, opposesitself to anything that does not fit into its flat language ofcausality, dissociated categories and plainly visible distinctions.\tsep{Pantheism -- went to end of Book I}\pa I have many times used expressions like \wo{\co{nothing}, that is,everything}.  Since \co{distinctions} are made in, that is, from\co{nothingness}, what we find has already been there.  Isn't itpantheism, then? No, it is not.  There is a seed of truth in pantheism, too, for itonly tries to express the fact that every thing is holy.  This,however, does not mean that everything is holiness.  Holines of every thing is \co{concretely founded}in holiness of your attitude.  If you are not holy, such an expressionmay have some sentimental appeal, but no real truth content.\wo{Everything} is but the expression we find for \co{nothingness} inthe differentiated world of feelings and concepts, eventually, of\co{reflection}.  But this \thi{everything} is not the totality ofthings, is not the sum of all things.  \co{Nothingness} is \co{above}them, it in no sense \wo{belongs to this world} but is, in fact,thoroughly \co{transcendent}.  That our \co{distinctions} derive their\co{objectivity} from the \co{One}, does not in any way mean that theysum up to the \co{One} -- they never do, because they never sum up toanything.  Pantheism would say that they do sum up. Personally, I do not know of any text which, if only taken seriously, without all too simplifying yearnings of \co{reflective precision}, without all too many \thi{if you say this, you {\em must} also mean that}, is patheistic in this naive form.The \co{spiritual} contact with the ultimately \co{transcendent One}happens at entirely different level than does the \co{reflective}contact with things, objects and facts.  And yet, it does \co{foundconcretely} the \co{immanence} of the \co{One}, its thorough\co{presence} in every thing.  It recovers the inspiring unity in themidst of the charming, and sometimes cruel, manifold.  There may besome who will shrugg at this apparent paradox, at this unacceptablecontradiction, at the mere \thi{subjectivity} of this \la{coincidentia oppositorum}, but they will shrugg at most other things I havesaid, so let them keep shrugging.\tit{Truth (and pragmatism)}\paWe are left with ... \co{nothing}. So? Do what you want? Of course,not. \co{Nothing} means everything. Yet, we are left with a kind of missingfoundation, for except for the \sch\ which happens \co{above} us anyway, therest seems completely undetermined and open. So, no foundation for science,objective truth, truth...?Indeed, with respect to all the \co{visible} things, except for the imperativeof \co{non-attachment}, we are left with a kind of open pragmatism: try and hopefor the best. Indeed, there are no \co{precise}, \co{visible} rules ensuringanything -- there are no sufficient conditions. Every field has its own localconditions and there is no greater reason to look for the common basis forquantum physics, brain biology, computer programming and the most recent trendin literary criticism, than there is for trying to force people from differentcultures to live next door to each other and share the same social code. But does it mean that there is no truth or, perhaps, only some machiavello-pragmaticcriterion of appropriateness for the achievements of the goals? Of course, not,for the whole issue concerns the choice of the goals and even if most are chosenas if semi-automatically, sub-consciously, the issue nevertheless remains anddelegates the whole pragmatism to a lower level of reflection.Truth is not \thi{what works}, it is rather a corrective. We can stay for themoment in a field of Wittgenstein's practice, rather than James' pluralisticuniverse. We have never heard the last word concerning what following a ruleconsists in, but here we do not need it. (It must probably remain a mystery,just as creation.) A rule, or following a rule (in the wayWittgenstein analyses it) is a good approximation to what we mean by a\wo{corrective}. It is that which remains silent as long as everything is ok andwhich protests in the moment something is not. It is not the fact, or event, ofbeing corrected, it is not the content of the correction but it is that whencethe correction originates.\imm In the trivial case of facts and situations, these constitute the basis forcorrection (provided that all agree on what counts as facts). Not respectingfacts is, well, stupid because it goes against their truth.\act Education and uprising, acquired social norms, small techniques of playinggames and solving minor problems, all that may fall under the name of rutine, oras Wittgenstein would say, following the rules, may function as corrective inour \co{actions}. It is \co{ego} and its luggage...With respect to scientifc theories, different things act as correctives. As Kuhnhas shown, there is a large element of sociological mechnisms influencing thesuccess of a theory. But of course, at the bottom of it, there are facts ofexperience, the results of experiments which are accepted as valid correctives-- theory is judged true if it conforms to their truth. There is, of course, anabyss of indeterminacy with which the champions of narrow-mided rationalism and even more narrow-minded scientism will keep fighting for ever. \mine Agreement as to the truth at the lower levels is conditioned by sharing some ofthe correctives at this level. Which facts count as facts, which among them asrelevant ones, what is significant and what not. All such questions at the lowerlevels may lead to insurmountable conflicts if the personal correctives of theinvolved people show sufficient divergence.Which values do I accept... and which do I live? Conscience may act as the corrective, but it must be sensitive. One may silence it\inv It is only the truth of the \co{existence} which may be a corrective at thislevel: being \co{confronted} and hence \co{not being themaster}. This is the last and only \co{absolute} truth, which \co{founds} theidea of truth at the lower levels, which makes it impossible to discredit theidea of truth for the sake of some fashionable perspectivisms, sophisms,relativisms, and the like. But as we have seen, even this truth can be ignoredand replaced by falsehood of \No. \paThus truth, being a corrective, is indeed involved in our activity but not exactly inthe way pragmatism would like to have it. Thinking, also theorizing, may be ouractivity which needs a corrective like anything else. It does not show only\la{post factum}, as that which turned out to be the most successful. It will inmost cases announce its objections before, or at least, during our actions. And ifwe do not take them into account then\ldots well, who knows? We may still live,perhaps even be successful and satisfied -- for truth can be ignored. A stupidone can ignore even facts, perhaps not for long, but for the moment. A smart onecan ignore his conscience, and everybody can ignore \co{nothingness}. Buttruth is that which wins, eventually. This is not any deep insight but merelythe consequence of the definition. The corrective which objects in the momemntsomething is done wrong, will keep objecting until it is satisfied. Thus,apparently, we might agree again with the pragamtism, but it would require acloser distinction. We would agree that truth is that which wins -- eventually!But according to a possible interpretation, \wo{that which works} might win bydefinition and thus turn out to be truth. In such a case, we disagree completelybecause truth, although recognizable as a corrective, is not a purelyoperational term with which we could dispense. Our truth is there before, or inany case, during the process, not only at its end. Only therefore it can providea corrective. \tit{Language}\paIt is, in a sense, only a question about language. For the most, we do agree on the kinds and qualities of various experiences, we only sometimes call them by different names.However, language may reveal or confuse.  Calling things andexperiences we place them in the context of the unity, of our being, of Being,  weassign them a place there.  Language is a meeting place of traditionand novelty, of past and future.  Drawing its structure andsignificance from itself, that is, from the shadow of the past, italways reflects or tries to reflect the actuality, before it begins tocast its shadow on the future. The shadow of the past meanings is the most valuable possession of the language. But as Jung says, integration of the shadow is an indispensable aspect of the process of individuation, and this happens by frist \thi{dismembering} the given meanings and then \thi{integrating} the scattered parts into a new unity, which is but a new form of the old one. (This last qualification is, of course, my addition and does not seem to apply in the Jungian individuation process.)Speaking about \thi{God's venegance}, \thi{His will}, \thi{works},etc., one may be easily accused of inventing invisible, irrationalcauses for the visible effects which, moreover, should be andsometimes even are explainable by visible means.  In many cases theyare.  But are they always?  No, but what we do not know today, we willeventually learn.  Really?  And even if, what does it help me --today?  That instead of an invisible source of something I posit anideal limit, that instead of anchoring my being in the midst ofeternity I reduce it to a mere stage on a way towards something I cannot even imagine, that instead of giving my indivuduality an accountcompatible with the experience of my life, world, and the ultimate, Ibecome only an accident of a history of progress.  A lot ofintellectual confusion, scientific idolatry or sociological bias isneeded for anybody to take it seriously.\paThe language is there and there is no need for inventing a new one. If one wants to {\em invent} one, one better consider the fate of\la{Esperanto}.  The only problem is to appreciate the depth which thelanguage we have can hide, when most we hear around are factual reports of more or less intelligent attempts to mix water with flour in order to get glue.And so the linguists will have something to do for all the future(until, of course, one gets bored).  For just like repetition is theonly way of Being, of being onself -- by repeating the invisiblefoundation in a concrete, that is, ever new, personal and unrepeatableform, so language follows after this reality of life.  Allowing forexpressing in actual form invisible presence, it is one of thegreatests gifts of \ldots of what?  I want to say, of the origin.  Butsure, of evolution, of the historical and social processes which ledto the development of language.  But the fact that it emerged onlythrough some evolution which we can vaguely -- and always only vaguelyand even unclearly -- posit, does not change anything.  If we had acomplete knowledge of its development then, perhaps, we could do thisand that.  But this is a contrafactual \thi{if} of such dimensionsthat it shouldn't be necessary to worry about it.  The hidden, deep orshallow structures of the language will never be confined to preciseand univocal rules, for language not only developes but also lives --it lives the life of those who speak it.  And like with all life, wecan try to improve it, adjust it, change it but, at the bottom of it,we can only try because we have no clue.  The only thing we can docertainly and deliberately, entirely in accordance with our will, isto destroy it, to kill it.  This, we {\em can} do and this we know{\em how} to do.  There is not much more we can and know for sure.\pa Everything can be understood differently. It may be debatable whether \citt{there is nothing so absurd that it has not been said by some philosopher.}{Cicero, De Divinatione, II:58} But there is hardly anything so absurd which could not be, or even which had not been, heard some philosopher saying. One can say thatvarious concepts, like \co{actuality}, \co{distinction}, etc.  do notcapture what they are supposed to express; that {\em actually}, whatbelongs to \co{\ldots} is also this and that, and not only what Iincluded and listed under it.  And I may agree -- there are no absoluteplaces where distinctions have to or must not be drawn in anunconditional manner.  But if one draws them very differently, one willobtain a different philosophy.%-- if only it allows me to recognize%some aspects, preferably vague intuitions, which appear valuable and%relevant, I am more than willing to listen to.  I am, however, afraidthat in order to do that, one would still have to {\em conceptualize} the unity of life and experience. This may certainly be done differently, because concepts are only actual signs of the underlying intuitions.\tsep{? perhaps, move to II.Some consequences ?}\tit{Reality}\paAnd what about reality? I objected so strongly against the labels \thi{real} and \thi{unreal} because there is nothing except \co{dissociations} of disappointment which might justify this distinction. But like everything else so reality, too, has degrees. Real is what you can not live without.  Not what you need or what youwould like but what you {\em can not} live without.  Breath, air,water \ldots Sure. If one can not live without the pink linen in one's luxurious bedroom, the linen threatens with becoming all too real, perhaps even obsessively so. If you go for years with the uncessant thirstfor peace, fulfillment, for something which you start calling\wo{happines} or \wo{love} or \wo{success}, but which you also knowcan not be named -- it is real, oh, very real.  If you can not get ridof a terrible image from a devastating experience you went throughlong time ago, it is more real than all the nicietis you may findaround you.  And when you finally manage to overcome it, it becomes\ldots unreal, you can breath freely again and live without it.%what you would not live withoutReal is what can not be replaced, what can not be substituted bysomething else.  That is, as always, something is {\em the more} real,{\em the less} it is possible to replace it.  The lack of the\thi{sense of reality} may lead to an attachment to this or that, tomy car or my house, to my dog or all the world's animals.  And allsuch attachments are real and make things to which I am attached highlyreal.  But it is good to keep some sense of proportions.  In thesocial context, a great scientist or a great political leader is muchmore real than a shoemaker (today, we should probably say, aprogrammist, or a cleaning lady).  The most real is a person -- a person's birth and pact with God make it irreplaceable becausenon-repeatable.  \co{My life} is so real not just because Icherish it so much and because it is \co{mine}, but because I know that it, too, is unique.Real is what is shared, and the more real that which can be sharedwith less diminunition.  The most real is the \co{origin} shared byall and everybody.  Love is more real than hate, although the latteris still more real than bricks, commodities, money or other things itmay destroy, and which may be replaced.  Sharing gives the deepestsense of reality and it is utter loneliness which forces one to lookfor it somewhere else.And so, real is what is true, and what is true is real. One could not live without being born from the origin, no idol can relplace the origin and the origin is what is most deeply and intimately shared by all. The more truly I reflect the \co{origin}, the more real I and my life become. Eventually, only life can be real just as only life can be true -- \citt{the way and the truth and the life.}{John XIV:6}\tit{Concept summary...}\begin{enumerate}\item \co{One} \simu \co{nothing} \simu \co{origin} (not everything, not yet and  not ever; but in everything...)\item \begin{tabular}[t]{lccc}    being = & distinction & + & pariticpation  \\            & immanence   & + & transcendence \\            & actuality   & + & non-actuality\\            & visible     & + & invisible     \end{tabular}\item Erkentnis (appropriation) \simu actualization (not Aristotelian!):  transforming/translating into actuality  \begin{itemize}   \item act or several acts    \item act(ual) insight / getting the concept, idea   \item using it -- in relation to other actualities, also tacit knowledge   \item also understanding = knowing the limits does actualize....  \end{itemize}\item Truth \simu that which is signified by every sign (that which  every sign is a sign of), eventually \co{One}  \\  False -- ???\item Good \simu whatever keeps Heaven and Earth together  \\  Evil -- alienating, separating, dissociating...\item Real \simu that without which one can not live\\  Unreal -- dispensable, unnecessary...
