It certainly is not: to strengthen faith, toweaken faith, to strengthen faith in reason, to weaken faith in reason, todefend science, to attack science, to promote investigations into somedirection, to encumber investigations in some direction, to embrace ecstaticallywords and defeat representations, to restrain the cacophony and to promotecontrolled representations\ldots What is my problem? I do not have any.If I had, I would try to solve it rather than write a book, and if I wrote abook to solve my problem I would not tell you that. What new do I have to offer?Nothing -- I am neither a scientist nor a news reporter. (As a matter of fact, Iexpect you to know most things I have to tell.)Finding answers to such questions in the introduction means today that one cando well without reading the book. Its detailed table of contents can besummarised briefly: 1.~The great (or a lesser) challenge, 2.~The hero facing thechallenge,  3.~The final victory, 4.~Concluding remarks (whose apparentmodesty equals only the arrogance of the underlying attitude). Such books,produced at the rate exceeding the production of films with the same manuscript, though usually more vulgar contents,sprinkled with broad knowledge of facts and expressions of acquaintancewith the recent events at certain cultural level, or even (in the braver cases)at some lower level,\noo{though then written with a clearly squint eye),} nourish the intelligent mob (not only in the country where most of them arewritten), increasing its fascination even faster than its general confusionand dissatisfaction. For all that is very smart and intelligent, very smart andintelligent indeed, offering breaking discoveries and final explanations andsounding, if not like the trumps of the doom so, at least, like the honks ofapplications for research grants or of ending tenure tracks. Good is no longerenough. Spectacular, breath-taking, amazing, wonderful or -- on the other but infact the same note -- useful, applicable, pragmatic, advantageous,beneficient\ldots One reads, one learns a lot and, in the end of the day, one knows aslittle, or even less, than in the beginning. Are you not tired? I am. {\em This} is a useless rumination offering nothing newand proving absolutely nothing -- at best, suggesting only some thoughts overthings known for millenia.  \tsep{...}Not seeing differences witnesses to dilettantish simplifications. But is notsimplicity also the ultimate goal of scholarly thoroughness: to simplify the complicated,to arrive at the unity which -- perhaps in a different sense but still --removes contradictions discovered and produced by thelegions afraid of being called simple-minded? Every simplicity can beaccused of simplification, while many simplifications can be misunderstood assimplicity. Where is the line separating the two? Isn't it, at least to someextent, in the ear and eye of the beholder? You tell me. Avoiding complicationsmay, so it seems, end up as one or as other...\tsep{???}%\subsubnonr{anthropology, account, summa}%\input{00pref}But if such a useless nothing, why \la{summa}? What could possibly make one write a \la{summa}, of any kind, nowadays?Complexity -- not only of the incomprehensible totality of the world, but evenof every single issue -- makes it look pretentious. Things fall apartand observing the dissolution or, as many a one pretends, praising it as theopenness unto plurality, is the only reasonable attitude, in fact, the onlypolitically correct way of distancing oneself from the trauma and danger of monism,that is, totalitarianism.Yet, philosophy which does not try to capture any unity ends up as a catalogueof particular cases, particular concepts or just words, which may be aselaborate, intelligent and intricate as it is uninteresting and useless.Philosophy which distances itself from any attempt at reaching some wisdom, andthat means in particular, thinking and relating to the ultimate questions, ends up calling its impotency for modesty and glorifying the incessantquestioning, that is, public scratching one's head with the emanatingself-assurance that all genuine issues should be left to those who areunintelligent enough to expect any answers. After all, it takes an analphabet tobelieve that truth is written some place.% But receiving guidance does not exclude autonomy and it appears to us quite% unfortunate that%Philosophy attempts to think what one knows. For to know means much more thanwhat Plato explains in \btit{Timaeus}, or what others have tried (and are stilltrying) to specify withrespect to explicit, reflective thoughts, \gre{episteme}. Sure, I know thepythagorean theorem and the way from my house to my work. But I also know thatI will die, I know my love of my mother, I know how she loves me, I know what mybest friend likes and of what my girl-friend is afraid. I know that I am thesame person I was yesterday and I know that, from behind the invisible forces,the hidden eye of God's  watches everything. Most of these things I am notactually able to think, not to mention, to express precisely and explain withany degree of stringency.%We know what philosophy is, don't we? We know what is {\em not} philosophy andwe know what is, at least, when we encounter it. We can even tell goodphilosophy from bad one. And yet, can anybody tell what we thus know? Cananybody think this knowledge clearly enough to express it precisely toeverybody's, or even only to one's own, satisfaction? %Knowing, we might perhaps say, is what allows me toconsent to some thoughts and to reject others. For when I content to the truth ofa thought, I do it in the light of something I know. Only in very special casesthis knowledge consists of other, explicit thoughts.%To think what one knows is a challenge, just like it is a challenge to become what one is. Only to a self-satisfied rationalism such challengesmay appear as paradoxes, and only to a narrow-minded pedantry as contradictions.The attempt to think what one knows need not (as it seems, can not any longer)rely on necessary principles and forcing arguments. Those who try\citet{withholding their consent from any proposition that has not been  proved}{CiceroGods}{ I:1. [In the translation of F.~Brooks: \wo{refusing to    make positive assertions upon uncertain data}.]} end up with absolute certainty -- about nothing. The rigidity of irrefutable argumentation whichattempts to force its conclusions and tries to dispense with everything whichescapes such attempts seems, indeed, to empty every phenomenon of itsconcreteness yielding only residual site whose necessity equals its hollowness.But the lack of the universally forcing arguments is not the same as the lack ofany truth, the lack of the necessary laws is not the same as the lack of anyorder. Besides (or instead of) the effcient causes there may be many necessaryones, besides (or instead of) the sufficient reasons there may be manyinsufficient -- but, as Weber would say, favourable and supportive -- ones. Justlike explanations try to capture the former, so a more modest account may try toidentify only some of the latter.\citeti{I say the following about the Whole ... Man is that which we all  know.}{Democritus}{ DK 68B165}Philosophical anthropology tries to give an account of human life. This does notmean isolating this specific \thi{object} and ignoring all the rest. It amountsonly to seeing all the rest in a specific perspective: not as a set ofinviolable mechanisms but as the field of unfolding of human existence.  Thedualism of deteminism confronting freedon, of \thi{objectivity} confronting\thi{subjectivity} is only a result of a particular way of thinking  the existentialconfrontation which precedes the understanding -- and dissociation -- of thesetwo (and other) aspects.  The two, posited as the ultimate poles, can never notonly agree but even meet and one is constantly forced to the impossible choiceof the one or the other. Above and across this impossibility one may try to drawthe border between the two in ever new ways.  For even if the number of theelements, say, of the constitutive dimensions of existence, is limited, the concreteborders between them may be drawn in an unlimited variety of ways. Every humanbeing draws these borders anew and the abstractness of the fact that somebodyelse did it earlier in a similar way does not in the slightest diminish theconcrete need to do it ever anew.\ftnt{Besides, \thi{limited} can be, in all practical  respects, as good (or bad) as infinite. On how many different points can any  two philosophical systems differ?  Ridiculous question, but to play the game  only for a while, let us say some number which certainly is lower than it is  in fact, say: 100. Simplifying further, let us say that on each of these  points one has only a binary choice, yes or no, + or --. How many different  \thi{systems} do we get? Well, $2^{100}$.\noo{This is, if we were to believe    such calculations, approximately the square (perhaps cubic) root of the    estimated number of atoms in the universe.} If humankind produced one such  system every second, it would take some $2^{75}$ or, rounding off, $10^{20}$  years to merely produce them all. This is a bit more than twice the estimated  age of the universe.\noo{10^9 And merely producing them is not even the  beginning of anything.} Thus, even if the   number (of possible forms of existence, of possible philosophical systems)  were finite, the simple combinatorics is on the side of   unrepeatability -- not principal, however, not in some ideal infinite limit,  where indeed the finite number of possibilities would have to be reapeated infinitely  many times, but only in practice, that is, in fact. (If one wanted now to  reduce the number 100 to, say, 20 such points,\noo{ at   which two systems might differ} it still leaves over 1.000.000  possibilities.)} %Everything has been said before -- {\la{mundus senescit}} (\wo{the world has  aged}) noticed St.~Gregory of Tours in the VI-th century and some 1500 yearsbefore him a preacher observed \citeti{[t]he thing that hath been, it is that  which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there  is no new thing under the sun.}{Eccl.}{I:9} This may sound a bit depressingbut only to an intellectual capable of dealing exclusively with abstractions, or tothe petty mentality occupied with even pettier novelties, one \citeti{consoled  by a mere trifle, as it is distressed by a mere trifle,}{after  \citeauthor*{Pensees}}{II:{136}} for which everything beyond the yesterday'sscandals and today's news is a boring repetition. But \citeti{what is right can  well be uttered even twice.}{Empedocles}{ DK  31B25\noo{\citaft{FirstPhil}{: 58, p.165}}} Moreover, to understand something  said before one often must say it oneself. Every existence says anew something said before, but saying thisconcretely amounts to drawing anew the distinctions in the matter of life, thedistinctions between abstractions like \thi{love} and \thi{indifference},\thi{indifference} and \thi{impotence}, \thi{impotence} and \thi{thirst},\thi{thirst} and \thi{lack}, \thi{lack} and \thi{illusion}, \thi{illusion} and\thi{lie}, \thi{lie} and \thi{truth}\ldots The infinite concreteness lies insuch distinctions and the lack of final definitions is only another side of thisconcreteness. And the lack of rigid definitions does not mean the lack ofsignificant distinctions.Giving an account of -- rather than explaining -- human existence, we are notvery concerned with many accepted distinctions. We certainly have to keepvarious points of the discourse at approximately the same level of abstractionbut this need not prevent us from addressing also issues which theadministration of academic life places at differentdepartments. \citet{Philosophy is first of all a science about human being,  about integral human being and of integral human  being.}{Bier}{I:2\kilde{p.21}} % The advantage of philosophical anthropology is that no posited% objectivities-in-themselves need to disturb us.Asking a question, we will often rest satisfied with relating it only tothe place it occupies in the field of existence. Whether the question happens tosound (or traditionally even {\em is}) theological, psychological, mythological orastrological is of no importance, as long as it addresses an aspect of thisintegrity. \wo{\la{Summa}} from the title refers to such a summary, to the attempt to gather quite different, sometimes even disparate, aspects into one unity and notto the ultimate summit, to the vanity of collecting all relevant (and irrelevant) details in a systematicand scientific totality.%\input{hee}\tsep{}One of such questions, perhaps the only question of all philosophy, is:%%\equ{What is true?\label{questA}}\begin{center}What is true?\end{center}%Some try to answer it in the way it is asked, that is, indissociation from any person asking it. Such an answer amounts always tospecifying what one, everybody, you and I {\em should} accept as true.The \thi{should} is usually surrounded by the arguments and proofs which shouldconvince everybody. Unfortunately, any respect expressed by imputations of rationality, accusations ofirrationality, expectations of a direct and infallible communication is,  at best, merely the respect for some \thi{rationality}. As far as a personal meeting with the reader, that is, as far as the person of the readeris concerned, it shows disrespect equal only to that displayed by the strangely popularreluctance to express one's meanings in an understandable form. The differenceof proceeding results only in that sometimes the latter, but never the former,can be excused on the assumption of incapacity. The best, in fact, the only thing one can do is to answer this (as any other)question for oneself or, what amounts to the same, to accept some known answer.The answer may be communicated to others but only as {\em my} answer -- I may beconvinced that you should accept this answer, too, but I do not even try toconvince you about that. What you do with my answer is your sake, in fact, tounderstand it you have most probably already known it, even if you did not thinkit yourself in the same way. \citet{Gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophyso far has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and akind of involuntary and unconscious memoir [\ldots] In the philosopher[\ldots] there is nothing impersonal.}{BeyondGE}{ I:6} Moreover, the\citet{beliefs to which we most strongly adhere are those of which we should  find it most diffcult to give an account.}{BergTime}{ II p.135}% \citt{It is almost incredible that men who are themselves working % philosophers should pretend that any philosophy can be, or ever has % been, constructed without the help of personal preference, belief, or % divination.}{W. James, Essays in Pragmatism, I, p.24}Thus, since this, like every other question, is asked -- and answered -- only by aconcrete person, we can take it to be the same as:%%\equ{What shall I accept as true?\label{questB}}\begin{center}What shall I accept as true?\end{center}%Here one might object: one senses a difference, the element of subjectivity, orperhaps relativity, in the latter which does not disturb the former. But thedifference is only apparent: every answer to any of these questions, can be usedalso to answer the other. If something is true then, sure, I shall accept it assuch.  On the other hand, if I accept something as true it is because it is --as far as I can see, imagine, feel, understand, speculate -- true.  Unlike theformer, this later implication has been judged problematic, mainly because oneimagines some voluntary act of acceptance which one's subjectivity could decideto perform as it wished. The meaning of this implication will be our main themeand its validity will rest on the fundamental difference between relativity andsubjectivity.{Relativity of every observation and conclusion to the  subject making this observation and drawing this conclusion seems to be the  most obvious thing in the world. However, one can draw quite the contrary  conclusions from this observation. On the one hand, one can conclude that this  relativity for ever prevents us from gaining an insight into the true nature  of the world, into the true nature of things as they are \thi{in themselves}.  The underlying assumption is that things indeed are something specific \thi{in    themselves}, and even that they, at least in principle, can be described  \thi{in themselves}, as if independently from the view of the one making the  description. The contradictory nature of such a project seems hard to accept.  So, on the other hand, one can draw the conclusion that there are no things  \thi{in themselves} and, consequently, no measure of truth -- in short, that  relativity amounts to complete relativism and truth to mere (perhaps even  merely volitional) subjectivity. But does the fact that the specificity of  things \thi{in themselves} is only ideal and posited, show the ultimate void?  Does relativity of particular truths exclude absolute truth? Both these interpretations start from the assumed duality. Theintuition that the standard of truth carries an element of transcendence isopposed to the observation that absolute transcendence, dissociated and remotefrom any immanent view, is inaccessible and hence, at least in the latter case,irrelevant. We will instead take relativity as the basic phenomenon which  precedes and underlies various dualities like subject vs. object,  immanence vs. transcendence, acceptance as X vs. being an X, etc.}\ins{ [Reality -- is between] "Now, the quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected.

Emphasizing this directionamounts thus to a more modest project: not necessarily finding {\em the} truthbut rather, or at least, simply avoiding untruth. In the able hands of aquibbler this modesty might reduce to a mere scepticism but we will hopefullymanage to say also something meaningful.  We should only keep in mind that weare not following the fashion of {\em reducing} the first question to the second(which results in the interminable quest for \thi{subjective} criteria of\thi{objective truth}). We claim simply that the two questions are genuinelyequivalent, that everything \citet{that is known, is comprehended not according  to its own force, but rather according to the nature of those who know  it.}{Console}{ V:4.25\noo{154}} \noo{\citet{everything which is cognizable, is    cognized not according to its own power, but according to the powers of the    cognizing.}{Console}{ V:4.25 \noo{Filozofia Sredniowiecza,p.106}} }Giving only an account -- rather than explaining -- we will ignore manydistinctions. We will not, for instance, treat the above question as {\em the}question, focusing on which demands subordination and dissociation of all the others. Every genuine problem of humanexistence invovles necessarily all the others. One can frequently meet attemptsto address a specific \thi{philosophical problem}, elaborate in the scope of asingle paper the problem of free will, the problem of meaning, the problem oftruth.  Interesting and perhaps even to some extent legitimate as such attemptsmay be, they reveal the prejudice that such a division is at all possible, thatdistinct problems indeed can be treated in a relative independence; eventually,that only the closest scrutiny of the most minute distinctions is able to give anadequate description of any single issue. But the problem is that we not only donot quite know how one problem could or should be addressed and approached-- we do not quite know {\em what} any particular problem is. Attempting to isolate anyparticular problem for a separate treatement, we fight first with circumscribing it inany reasonable way which, however, {\em never} reaches the goal of becomingentirely satisfactory. In this process of partial circumscription we invest the problem with all the relations andimplications it carries to all the other problems. If one tries to address, say, the issue of freedom without at the same timeilluminating the meaning of subjectivity and openness to truth, the sense ofmeaningfulness, the presence or absence of the absolute, in short, withoutaddressing the intergrity of whole existence, one ends up with thedistinctions one started with and keeps opposing arbitrariness to determinism,subjectivity to objectivity, spontaneity of feelings to the rationality of some inviolable laws, etc.  Every (not only fundamental) issue is the sum of what itexcludes, is the border contracting the tension between this issue and othersinto which it is interwoven. In a bit strange (but, in fact, quite understandable)dialectics, the tradition which had marked the XX-th century with the missionaryzeal of dissociating all the issues and bringing them under objective, systematic andseparate analysis, ends up with the holistic and coherentist postulates, whetherwith respect to language, meaning or truth.  \noo{(Wittgenstein,  Quine, Davidson)} Even though one can not forget the idealistic origins of all suchpotulates, one would still like to deny their idealistic connections. And one almost manages that, at least, as long as one keeps dissociating, as long as one sticks to dissecting one particular issue at a time.We will not try to establish any totality which, in the presence of all too manyaccepted distinctions, would indeed be a vanity. We will therefore ignore many possibledistinctions -- not because they would necessarily destroy any unity we mightwish to find but because they would (tend to) completely obscure it. We hope to avoid the accusations of relating the unrelated bymaking at least plausible that the intimate affinity and kinship of vague yetdistinct aspects, their genuine unity preceds more rigid dissociations, and thatthe latter mark only the end -- or perhaps the middle, but certainly not thebeginning -- of the road.%\noo{We will certainly try to avoid pitfalls of pantheism (of which most such holismsare examples), but only because unity can be found above it and not, as somealso trying to avoid the same claim, because it does not obtain at all.}%% \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Sources, references and conventions}\input{00sc}%%%%%% END\noo{%ENDIn fact, most if not all meta-discussions in modern philosophy,arise as a consequence of elaborating the aspects discernible in (\ref{questB})but not in (\ref{questA}): the idealism versus realism, subjectivism orperspectivism versusobjectivism, correspondance versus verificationism or pragmatism, traditioninspired by phenomenology versus analytical scientism, existential orientationversus linguistic analyses,...We do not dismiss all these discussions as completely irrelevant but our firstgoal is not to be drown in the methodological and conceptual meta-perspectives. Afterall, they too are, at least originally, motivated by the interest in an answerto the first question.An important aspect of the second question, not present in the first, concernsthe suggested need of justification. If I am to accept anything, it better besufficiently justified. This element has overshadowed philosophy if not sinceits Platonic beginnings, so since Descartes. It has been used to distinguishphilosophy suggesting, in fact, that it is an existential difference which, incase of a philosopher, makes him rely exclusively on \thi{reason} while, forinstance in case of a theologian on some \thi{faith}, while in case of anaverage man on \thi{casual opinions of common-sense}.  This differentiation,reflecting already preoccupation with the second question, has of course nothingto do with the answer to the first question. But philosophers tend to make itrelevant by claiming that only their \thi{reason} can serve in answering thefirst question. Various accussations of\thi{irrationality} follow. Unfortunately, more often than not, justifications of claims to \thi{rationality} or even \thi{true rationality}, and in any case theresults of following them, amount to selecting only some truths which, as it happens, can be assessed by the \thi{reason}, or whatis actually meant by it.Such differentiations are, as a matter of fact, political issues, issues ofdelegation of competences, allocation of educational responsibilities, division offaculties and departments or even, as it happened inpost-Cartesian Repubic of Unified Provinces, of national conflict between theconservatists and liberal republicans.\ftnt{Cartesians supported liberation of  philosophy from its subordination to theology, while ortodox Calvinists  wished not only such a dependence but a state underlied religious  goverment. As any issue with a theological element was almost bound in the  Republic of that time to turn into a political one, so did this one.}We do not dismiss all such discussions as completely irrelevant, but we thinkthat they truly belong to politics. Who is responsible for what? and Who isentitled to what kind of questions? -- is it reasonable to believe thatanswering such questions may help answering (\ref{questA})? The problem is that they did notmanage to produce any certain measure of truth which could be used in evaluatingthe proposed answers to the first question. And, in fact, if they were toproduce such a measure, it could arise only as a consequence of answering, at somepoint or another, the first question. Of course, I shall accept as true onlywhat is true. The attempts to elaborate on the second question do not bring usany closer. The difference between the two can be seen by comparing them to therespective questions below:\equ{What is important?\label{questAA}}and\equ{How should I figure out what is important?\label{questBB}}We can iterate the meta-appications past (\ref{questB}) -- \wo{On what basis  shall I accept something as true?} -- just like past(\ref{questBB}). The infinite regress is very much like the infiniteregress of formal reflection. And, in fact, just like the formal regress of \wo{I think  that I think that...} adds nothing substantial to the first thought, and onlyenmeshes it in a  formality of a childish mechanism, so the formal regressof our meta-applications does not clarify anything with respect to the firstquestion, but only multiplies the possible issues, doubts and problems one mayexplicitly rise and discuss.One may easily object that, as a matter of fact, when the answer to(\ref{questAA}) is unknown and hard to find, one could get some help fromanswering first (\ref{questBB}). Formally, it may indeed seem so, but it is apure formality.  Notice that questions (\ref{questA}) and (\ref{questAA}) do notconcern any particulars which might happen to be special cases of more general laws, possibly useful to knowin treating the special cases. No, these questions have uncanny level ofgenerality which it seems futile to generalize further.  To such an objection wecan only answer: Sorry, disagree completely, for any answer to (\ref{questBB})will, in fact if not in principle, require at least a partial answer to (\ref{questAA}). It may certainly help to askanother, and related question, but approaching an issue from a differentperspective is not the same as approaching it from above. The only things thatmay happen in the latter case are that one either falls down or flies away.\subsubnonr{vs. arguments; Different tempers}Yet, philosophy is only a particular expression of the fundamentaldifferences of human existence:... Simplifying to the extremeopposition, the two tendencies are those of one vs. many, Plato vs. Aristotle,Aquinas vs. Ockham, Husserl vs. James, unity vs. plurality. Different tempers...\sepWhat makes Anaximander the first philosopher is that he tried to argue for andjustify his claims, he used arguments and not mere statements. This is, atleast, the general view of ... philosophers. The \thi{love of wisdom} withwhich one started, has long ago become the love of argument, to the extent thatwisdom without argument goes for simplicity if not stupidity.  One insists onthe arguments the more, the more one feels threatened, that is, the less onefeels certain of own self-identity.Thus one has managed to separate itself fromliterature with its usual lack of and occasional distaste for intellectualism.It was a bit more difficult to cut off theology but here, too, the fact thatsome aspects were assumed to be indisputable helped. Unfortunately, along withthat all the concern for the divine presence in the world was removed too.Indeed, how would one argue about God, immortality and other invisibles? Theirinvisibility amounts more or less exactly to the inadequacy of any arguments;after one got tired of proofs of God's existence, the whole \thi{topic} becamehighly inadeaquate, because incommpatible with the image of precise  logicalargumentation.The strange thing that so happened was the emergence of the perfectly univocaldefinition of valid arguments and mathematical precision in their study. Formallogic, and its subfield of comutability and recursion theory, put the finalperiod after the millenia of developing Aristotle's syllogism, Leibniz'scalculus of reason and the ideas of mechnical reasoning. We now know that, initself, it yields absolutely no insights and, moreover, that no mechnicalprocedure can ever be found for generating valid results...\sepThe title is used by others....I could have found another title but this does capture theessential feature of existential situation which is theonly object of this book\wo{Philosophical antropology} is but another way of saying\wo{description of the existential situation}.Ignore what is not experienced; what is really, objectively, in-itself is aslittle relevant for this description as the answer to the question whether theuniverse will continue expanding or starts at some point receding.We study human experience and how its various aspects are constituted. This isthe opposite, in fact, antagonistic approach to the one which starts with someready constituted elements and tries to explain the construction, emergence andfunctioning of a mechanism. One never knows if the given building blocsk arereally the eventual ones, nor even if they are appropriate for the task onetries to perform. We leave such exercises to the empirical project. Whether itsucceedes or not won't change one fundamental thing: the human experience. Weknow that it is Earth rotating around the Sun, and yet we can not stop talkingabout -- and in fact, feeling and living as if it was -- the sun rising up atthe horison. This is how things look from our standing point and no amount ofempirical or logical proofs and arguments, no amount of bad or good science,will ever be able to change that, unless, perhaps, one starts messing up withthe human beings themselves (and we may still hope that genetics won't go thatfar).We are not interested in mathematics or physics, in biology or sociology -- atmost, in how such forms of modelling the world emerge within the horison of ourexperience; we are not interested in objective time or space -- at most, in howsuch forms emerge and penetrate our experience; we are not interested in what isobjective and what is not -- only in how such distinctions may be relevant forus; we are not interested in life -- only in the feeling of life, or better, inliving. This looks pretty bad, right? Pretty empiristic, subjectivisitc,phenomenological, even idealistic, or perhaps just existentialistic! As a matterof fact, it is not any of these, at least I hope it isn't.But it is not any of their traditional opposites, either. It is only somethingin the direction of \ad{Anthropology}\citet{What is typical allows one to retain cold blood, only individually  conceived matters cause nervous shock.

We can easily imagine the world without human beings, butfor philosophical antropology such a world has no relevance.As we will try to show, such a world is only apparently imaginable-- in fact, it is totally unthinkable or else, to the degree it is,it is totally indistinct.(This has nothing to do with its objectivity or subjectivity, itsreality or ideality.)Thus philosophy which tries to present the world as it is in-itself,as it is sort of independently from human being, may be perhapsinteresting, sometimes even enlightening, but it will never provide a completely satisfactory account.

It seems that, at least, it requires (do we notice a necessary condition?)not being carried away, some sobriety. Or in less prosaic terms, rationalismrequires that one assumes a position only with the admittance of the possiblelimits of its validity, if not with the actual knowledge of such limits.  If oneaccepts this rather generous critical rationalism then we should be able tocomplain, all the way. Even to the point where one asks about the limits ofvalidity of this very position...

I want to give an account of apossible understanding of the unity of \ldots Yeah, of what?  Of ahuman being, of a person but, perhaps eventually, only of myself. \citt{Gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophyso far has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and akind of involuntary and unconscious memoir [\ldots] In the philosopher[\ldots] there is nothing impersonal;}{Nietzsche, {\em Beyond Good andEvil}, I:6} \citt{It is almost incredible that men who are themselves working philosophers should pretend that any philosophy can be, or ever has been, constructed without the help of personal preference, belief, or divination.}{W. James, Essays in Pragmatism, I, p.24}The very same words may be deeply meaningful to some and ridiculouslysuperficial, even stupid to others. This book is not meant to {\em convince} anybody aboutanything; I hope it will be found interesting by a few, and it isaddressed to these few.% You find pretty quickly, by just starting reading, if you are among them.What is my method?  I do not have any. \wo{Philosophy does not so much tell {\em what} to think as {\em how} to think.} All kinds of methodological postulates have polluted philosophy since it started to consider itself, or rather started {\em to try} to consider itself a science in the modern sense of the word\ldotsPositivism, pragmatism, phenomenology, all \thi{methodologies} of philosophical inquiry tried first of all to ape science, to achieve the same level of precision\ldotsBut \thi{how} is only, and only at its best, a pale reflection of\thi{what}, a method is at best only a desiccated sediment of aparticular way of understanding, which is dictated, if not determined,by the particular objects or sphere of experienced addressed. Scholastics knew it very well, but we do not like scholastics verymuch nowadays, do we?  Sure, \thi{how}, having extracted some resdiualsediments of \thi{what}, turns easily into a socio-politicalphenomenon, a \thi{school} or a \thi{party}, which pretends to know{\em the} axioms, and in any case at least {\em the} rules of thegame.  But the game goes on and the only rules are to beunderstandable, and then to have something worth understanding. \thi{How} a person thinks is merely an expression of \thi{what} hethinks -- uncovering, perhaps, some hidden or unconscious assumptions,but still only assumptions about the \thi{what}. To dissociate the two is aviolence against concrete thinking. Useful and justifiable as it may be in a social context, determined always by the overwhelming majority of mediocricy, it is a violence against concrete thinking.It is\thi{what} and only \thi{what} that interests me \ldots The \thi{how} only follows the suit \ldots \ad{Philosophy searches for the Absolute Reality --} whatever this might mean. Since epistemology, this changed to the search for the Absolute Knowledge of RealityA universal temptation underlies most of philosophy, the temptation to go after the absolute, the \he{undubitable} truth, to construct things, matters, the world once for all on a secure rock of \he{incontestable} reasons and matters of fact. The keyword of this temptation is ``security''. And neither the poor results nor even the schizofrenic split of the intellectual personality between `is' and `ought' are able to eradicate it. \begin{enumerate}\item Certainty -- justification: \begin{enumerate}  \item fear of the unexpected (reason vs. feeling)  \item flirt with science  \item[\isimp] unchangable  \item[\isimp] necessary \end{enumerate}\item Necessity (apriori) \impl irrelevant \\what must be (irrelevant) vs. what is/can be\end{enumerate}\paThe praise of arguments is but a side-effect of that. But what is an argument good for? Have you ever changed your mind concerning some fundamental matter because you have been exposed to an irrefutable argument? Have you ever accepted a view because somebody managed to produce a \thi{proof} of it? I do not think you have, but it is not only because\citt{[q]uestions of ultimate ends are not amenable to directproof.}{Mill, Utilit.  ch.I} An argument need not be \thi{direct proof}, it may be just an argument, although it always tries to force its conclusion, to convince. It is, indeed, a great field open for invebntivness and shrewdness of intellect. But \ldots if I do not find the cnclusion plausible, then all the shrewdness of the argument does not help a least thing.Philosophy can do better than produce arguments -- it can try to describe experiences or, perhaps, experience. If you find Kierkegaard worth reading, I doubt it is because of the excellency of his arguments. It is because you find something worth paying attention to, it is because you sense an attempt to communicate an experience which, being an experience of another human being, may turn out to be most relevant for yourself, too.\pa We do have a lot of philosophy which occupies itself withinventing new arguments for old truths and, on the way, withrearranging the language in order to give the truths, as well as thearguments, the apparent look of novelty.  Although the reasons forsuch a search remain hidden in the obscurity of academic vanity,it may be, perhaps, worthwhile. It is not my objective.\ad{We do not believe in Absolute Knowledge,} final justification. Reason, in the broad and traditional sense, implies, and since Nietzsche means, control; control over chaos and anarchy which threaten our finite being. The anarchic element is just the opposite of reason, is the unreasonable, the uncontrollable. Again, in a broad and traditional sense, it has often been identifiedwith emotions and feelings.The conflict between the two is thus not only a platitude of a second rate literature but also an analytic triviality -- it follows by definition. This looks like a great starting point! Does anything sell better than trivial platitudes? And the sale numbers are just reflection of the commonest, not to say the meanest, interest.Reason, having gradually turned into rationalism, did not give up its absolute claims expressed in itscontrolling function. But becoming {\em ratio}, it turned partial; after all, ``ratio'' refers to reason as much as to a relative value. Order needs proportions which bring divisions. Again by definition, reason loses the possibility of full control. But this only increases the tension -- the attempts to regain control become the more desperate.  \begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{2}\item Dissolution of subject (one of the guarants of infallibility) \begin{enumerate}  \item society, culture, epistemic authority, selfish gene, discourse ... \end{enumerate}\item Dissolution of concepts and distinctions \impl processes  (evolutionary epistemology) \begin{enumerate}  \item empiricism-rationalism-idealism-pragmatism (only rough distinctions)  \item Gestalt, holism (hermeneutics) ...  \item empirical turn (Dennett's I, dynamic systems ...)  \item sociological turn (soc. of knowledge: Kuhn, Rorty ...)  \item analytic-synthetic (Quine), ... \end{enumerate}But this only emphasises continuity between the old conceptual extremes.\end{enumerate}\paWe do not believe in absolute knowledge because we have lost grasp on objects. The empirical turn of much of philosophy is but an attempt to re-confirm our intimate involvement into the \thi{objective world}, the unbroken relation with the field of our experience, which seems to disappear dissolved in the arbitrariness of discourse or whatever one wants to install in its place. Dissolution of objects\ldots great! It will be an important point.\ad{No Absolute Knowledge \impl no Absolute}\label{pa:attitudes}Becauseepistemology got us used to identify reality with our knowledge thereof, itis often hard to see if renouncing Absolute Knowledge we do not also renounce Absolute Reality. ``Wer spricht \"{u}ber siegen? \"{U}berleben ist alles.''Inquiring into possibly ultimate dimensions of human existence is not popular.Knowledge, even if not absolute, seems still a relevant question. But its relevanceand reality haunt in the background.\begin{enumerate}\item agoraphobic: ``Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, dar\"{u}ber muss man schweigen''    (Witt. I = Witt. II) -- liguistic-analytic turn (despair, for intuition knowsthat language \isnt reality)\item ecstatic: catch the ineffable, use ``new'' language 'cos this is reality  (Heidegger, Derrida...)\end{enumerate}These two avoid distinction language \isnt reality, still under the spell ofepistemology; remove thing-in-itself, the transcendent\begin{enumerate}\item[3] Stay on the edge: moralism (Levinas, Rorty...); critical rationalism\end{enumerate} \subpaIt should be observed that the threeattitudes from \refp{pa:attitudes} are by no means specific to postmodernism. They are present in any encounter with the transcendence, in any encouter of a finite being with something that is greater than it. The character of the transcendence, that is, what is perceieved as transcendent and in what way, leads to various specific manifestations of these three basic modi: unreserved acceptance, claustrophobic refusal or sober confrontation.They have thus always been present in philosophy. I am now about to commithorrible simplifications and indefensible inadequacies. So I won't defense them nor claim that one couldn't arrange the following examples in a very different way. Each philosophy contains all the three moments of this tension. But each philosophy hasalso its specific flavour which, apart from all the technicalities,distinguishes it from others. I hope that you may recognize the flavours which made me classify each triple in thisway.\begin{tabular}{rlllll}tragic:  &  sophists & Hume &      nominalism        & Kant  & Husserl  \\comic:   & Plato  &    Spinoza &   extreme realism   & Hegel & Bradley, Heidegger \\pragmatic:& Aristot. &  Descartes & Abelards' realism  &     &  James, Scheler\end{tabular}\subsubsection{What is philosophy?}It does not appeal merely to the intellect (lest it gets sterile)!\ad{Reach reality} In general -- the temptation to reach reality; to be relevant; -- Cope with transcendence; {The greatest fear}of unexpected, new, unpredictable...\pa{Thing-in-itself,} objective world, etc. \co{There is}, yes, but what? I do know that \co{there is}, from the very beginning, from the virtual \co{signification} to the most advanced concepts, I know that there is something beyond them. But this something merely is ...

Universal, which means primarily, incontestable, applicable to and recognizable by all. The descriptive bias made it hard to recognize that the basic, most important aspect of human reality is actually concerned with the choice, fundamental, spiritual choice; that facticity and possibility of this choice is what, in the deepest sense, constitutes human reality. -- ethics tries to take care of this but only in letter. Living as a rather poor relative, on the outskirts of ontology and metaphysics, it is heavily influenced by the general frame of mind. It degenerates into detailed analysis of possible acts and actions, particular choices and, sometimes, attempts to formulate general, abstract forms of moral imperatives, dissociated from the results of the ontological and epistemological investiagtions.\ad{One --} Not science; not unity of sciences; not based on sciences; not concepts and their logic... but addressed to a whole human being.Not ``how'' and ``why'' are the primary questions -- they belong to sicence -- but ``what''.

I still read Heraclitus and Bible...\\Like in Kuhn's theory of quiet tides of science rising through periods of stabilityuntil reaching the revolutionary height and turning in a new direction -- history, and with it philosophy (?), presents us with such a picture. A turning tide, a confrontationwith transcendence in a new form, brings chaos and disorder. -- Sociology\ad{Rational}One used to think of rationality in terms of justification, which then is something like argumentation. However, we do not believe in the ultimate justification any more, do we? There is at most a difference of degree (and often not even that) betweenphilosophy focusing on the quality of the arguments on the one hand andrhetorics and sophisms -- disciplines, perhaps venerable, but hardly kept in highrespect nowadays. And to the general public, this is what philosophy often means-- sophisticated and convincing arguments for the most ridiculus and unconvincingtheses.The arguments function the better, the more petty matters are at stake -- ``Shall we eat indian or mexican?''... The more important matters are concerned, the less imperative the arguments become, because then they are merely attemptsat justifying what we already are convinced about. Eventually, arguments never convince.In the matters of real importance, argumentation is just a sign of lacking respect - one tries to convince by explaining toanother what he apparently is unable to understand. If he only could, if he only saw all the valid reasons which we see, he would accept our conclusion.\thi{Big words}, or better \thi{high words}, on the other hand, do not force their meaning upon us. Their vagueness invites to most personalinterpretations and misunderstandings. Yet, they are not for this reason arbitrayand incomprehensible. They only hint at something not fully expressible, which weare free to model and interpret -- they leave us freedom, exactlybecause they do not have a unique, precise meaning.As such, they are the opposite of arguments which, in honesty orarrogance, always attempt to force the other to accept them.\paThe important thing is that what is being said is said as clearly and understandablyas possible. For such a purpose, arguments may, occasionally, have a value, just asexamples do. They are not, however, applied to force any conclusion, but merely to illustrate the connections between various aspects of the discourse -- in particular,those which seem more acceptable and those which seem less so. But to identify them with the whole importance of rationalism is to turn it intosophism.Now, forgeting justification and keeping in mind the inherent partiality of reason, I would formulate the thesis of rationalism as follows\thesis{\label{th:panrat}A rational acceptance of a statement is the one accepting the limits of its applicability/validity.} %(Critisism concerns these limits.)% Science is relative to a context...of possible falsification/criticism % which is exactly what limits the scope of scientific theories.I may not know what these limits are but, at least, I am open for the possibility of their existence. And as far as I am able to, I tryto specify them. \paThis thesis is not limited to the theory of science but can be taken as a quite general fundament of a philosophical project. For the first, even the generality and absolutism need not be dogmatic -- I am tryingto communicate some experiences, perhaps the ultimate ones, but I admit thatmy formulations may be unfortunate, may be unclear, may be improved.For the second, it is self-applicable: many statements, not only the statements ofthe absolutistic philosophy, can be accepted without limits. Saying ``I love you'' one would like to give it an absolute value -- no temporal or contextual factors should limit its validity. This is perhaps the most irrational meaning one can give to this most irrational statement and I do not think that anybody who has ever made it this way would like it to have been made with all rational reservations. However, even the irrational statements and attitudes can be treated in a rational way according to \refp{th:panrat}. Sure, they lose then their magical air of actual existential commitments but philosophy is, at best, a reflection of life and never the life itself. It may invite to making some commitments or choosing a particular way, but it is never such a commitment or choice itself.\paFrom the existential point of view, thesis \refp{th:panrat} implies something like the following attitude: I keep my convictions and comittments as long asI do not encounter the contexts (situations, arguments, attitudes) which ivalidate them, which make tham impractical, unviable or unacceptable (in whatever sense). In such situations I do not haveto renounce them entirely -- typically, I will merely introduce more reservationsconcerning their applicability. More importantly, it does not implythat all such convictions and comittments are kept rationally -- the deepest, most significant aspects of my being and acting are, probably, those which have not as yet got the chance to be explicitly limited. Their source does notlie in any critical examination but beyond. Still, the attitude makes me, at leastin principle, open for the possibility that they too may need such a limitation at some time. But I may nourish implicit and explicit convictions of variousdegrees of constancy, some being easily disposed of, other being of fundamentalimportance so that only the most extreme circumstances may shatter them.\com{Perhaps, knowledge in a stricter sense, involves a rational acceptance with theexplicit statement of such limits.}\pa{\em Explicit concepts} -- unlike literature or poetry. (lists of distinctions; perhaps, just enough words for the vague concepts)and thesis~\ref{th:panrat}-- don't multiply concepts and distinctions. They never match experience, while one thinks that, more and more disitinctions will bring one closer. Nothing more illusory!\paOf course, all cannot be embraced with a scientific precision ...-- {\em Proper abstractions}! ... create = ignore $A$, assign weight to $B$; economy of signs.\ad{Is vs. Ought}Ontology vs. axiology; the world as it is vs. as it should be. There is no doubt that we can speak about our wishes as to what or how the world should be. That we can speak about how it actually, really is, looks much more like a wished for assumption. And taking into account the rather poor results of the attempts at establishing any form of consensus in this matter, it even looks like a possibly wrong assumption. It pushes ethics on the side -- for who can doubt the primacy of the real reality over mere \thi{ought} -- while, at the same time, leaves theoreticians in an eternal despair over the lost connection with life. The separation of theory and practice, engendered by the conviction that they address the same reality, makes theory irrelevant and practice unreliable. It separates man from the world he lives in, that is, from himself. In the middle of the pretensions to know how the world is, perhpas even how it must be, and -- what is usually even more annoying -- moralising advice on how it should be, the crucial question asking {\em how it can be} appears highly\he{reproachable}. Avoidings both other questions, it promises a mere \la{Weltanschaung}. But avoiding these respectable questions, it also avoids the schizofrenia they caused. And furthermore, it avoids the almost inevitable arrogance of the attempts to answer them and claims to having done so. And who would daresay that, on the final account, and in spite of all the claims to the contrary, any philosophy -- and any of its opponents -- offers anything more than a \la{Weltanshaung}, a statement ``look, you {\em can} see the world this way''? One may try to hide behind claims to objectivity and absolute truth but then, if not anybody else then eventually the history will fetch one from this hiding place.\pa\label{pa:tomee}It all may be wrong. It may be, however, only wrong for you. It may also be wrong for many others while it may seem right to you. It is so to me. \paThis is, roughly, the history of Western philosophy, perhaps, its short version for the lazy students. This is also the theme of this book -- for those who, in their perplexity, find simply living the life somehow ...unsatisfactory. I doubt that anybody can learn from it anything which he otherwise does not know. It is only, a sort of, giving an account. And giving an account is like paying a bill -- it brings the satisfaction of fulfilling an obligation. But since the smartness and skills of a self-made one have reached the sky on the stock market,getting away without paying the bills is a reason to pride. Paying them is stupid. \citt{For the people of this world are more shrewdin dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.}{Luke, 16:8}\paPhilosophy attempts to derive something obvious from something acceptable. Itisn't an art of discovery but of appreciation.\noindent\dotfillThe problem of the existence of the external world comes from\begin{enumerate}\MyLPar\item\label{sub-ob}thinking of our being in terms of the idealized, timless subject-objectrelationship, and \item\label{dedworld}the attempts to construct or deduce the world from within such a horizon of pure actuality.\end{enumerate}It is just one of the problems arising from this perspective, totality of my being, and phenomenon of time being other well-known examples. If, on the other hand, I think of myself as being capable of continuous experience and take time asa fundamental, rather than possible, notion, the existence of the world beyondmy experience ceases to be a problem and becomes a fact of experience.\paLet me emphasise again, but for the last time, that I am not looking fornecessary, irrefutanle truths. there is no {\em necessity} of such anadmission. One may let the all-powerful \co{objectivistic attitude} prevail,reducing the world to a never reachable totality of independent objects. ButI do not aim at a \co{re-construction} of a pre-reflective truth, which iswhat it is and cannot be otherwise -- which is necessary. Such a truth may beof interest to a scientist but, as I said before, it cannot satisfyreflection.  Perhaps it is true, perhaps everything we experience can bereduced to some basic, pre-reflective facts, even to some necessary physicalor chemical reactions. But then a naive question arises -- so what?  How canthis ``wisdom'' affect my life and actions? Is it at all relevant thatsomething, which cannot be otherwise, is as it is? Suppose that somebody produced a definite proof that it is so. And? Shall Ichange anything in my life because of such a proof?  Shall I stop feeling theway I do and choosing as I do? The only way such a proof might becomerelevant would be to produce some controlling mechanisms.  Perhaps, havingtraced everything to such a basic level will enable us to control everythingwhich is above -- and as some maintain, independent from -- it. Then it mightbe a different story, but only to the extent, that our feelings and choicescould span over a different, perhaps wider range.  So far, the verymeagerness of such results makes the whole project as irrelevant forphilosphical reflection, as it is relevant for the \co{objectivisticattitude} of science and controll. Let those who believe in it, work on it.Necessary truth is what it is and {\em cannot} be otherwise -- do what youwant.  Thus, although it determines me, it does not affect my reflectiveattitude -- it must be so, and there is nothing I can do aboutit. Philosophical flirts with necessity do not interest me not because onecannot produce cunning arguments in its favor but because they make the wholeendeavor existentially irrelevant. Firmness of existence arises from thefragility of its background, not from the necessity of its assumptions.  Evenif at the bottom everything is involved in a play of deterministic forces,this, certainly, is not the reality of our \co{experience}. In particular, thereis an element of freedom in reflection, if not in anything else, then atleast in the choice of its object. Reflection may admit that something hasrelevance but that it cannot or does not want to focus on it and chooses tofocus on something else. Appeal to necessity of considering this rather thanthat is a simple act of disrespect. The point is not to demonstrate necessarytruths but truths which are of interest, not to \co{re-construct} but, yes,to construct.  What matters for me is not an inescapable result of necessaryprocesses, but the question  how and, above all, towards {\em what} directmy reflective attitude.\paWhat I see as the aim of philosophical enterprise is not to build a theory about how things really are, even less to build a theory which simply isn't inconsistent. Rather, I see it as some \thi{economy of language}, \thi{economy of words} whichshould be spoken in as purposeful manner as possible.I do not think that many(if any) proponents of philosophical theories which we would classify as implausible ment really ridiculous things -- but their language sometimes makes us feel as if they did. ``Reincarnation'', ``immorality'', ``deeper Self'', ``God'', ``external world'' etc. may all happen to refer to some things one wants to convey in a way unmatched by any other words. They may make speaking simpler, thus appearing most economical andfar better than ``circulation of matter'', ``immortal fame'', ``super Ego'', ``opium for people'', ``transcendentally ideal world''. We have a tendency to believe that the latter express some concepts and (therefore?)are more precise:they reduce the former to something apparently more understandable, moreadequate for a reasonable discourse. But I am not sure that a discourse is``reasonable'' when it excludes or simply distorts matters unclear andnever given as well defined objects, only because theycannot be stated in unambiguous terms, preferably with the precision approaching that of mathematics.\paThe goal of reflection is not to re-construct the original, pre-reflectivetruth. The origin of reflection -- experience -- harbours the possibility ofreflection and the material for it. But is made of a differentmatter which cannot be fully and completely re-created with the categories ofreflection. The concrete material of pre-reflective experience can be, atbest, mimicked, symbolised but not re-constructed by reflection.The only thing reflection can (and should) do is to construct its ownworld. Its own, because reflection, like any other activity, can operate onlywith its own categories. But this world should be constructed in such a waythat its original truth can live through and within it. One should striveafter the concepts which not only do not falsify or oppose the pre-reflectivefeelings and understanding, but which actually open for their presence, allowthem to enter the world of reflection and unfold therein.\ad{Novelty}New insights -- rather inspiring new branches, history, sociology, psychology...-- But otherwise, human-wise, \la{nihil novi}, -- [used in chap. III, Intro] \citt{\la{Mundus senescit}}{Gregory of Tours, {\em History of the Franks}, \~594AD} ``The world ages''So WHY?-- ``One can't construct a system which captures (the whole) reality.'' But, infact, more is true -- one cannot capture reality into words! Kierkegaard'scriticism of a system does not (really) address systematic analysis but theintellectual arrogance believing that it does manage that...-- A new philosophical book is but an expression of understanding, or misunderstanding, the old books. There are no new thoughts, no thoughts which were not thought before. The goal is not to think new thoughts, but to understand the old ones. Heidegger recommended return to Greeks, to Heraclitus, if possible, even farther back. So did Rousseau\ldots There is no kernel, no historical site -- it is everywhere, and nowhere\ldots\subsection{We have \ldots, and shall\ldots}\ad{Actuality}We have heard the trumpeths!  We have noticed the importance of distinguishing the beings from their Being, we have noticed the metaphysical preoccupation withpresence or, as I shall call it, with \co{actuality}. The barbarians have entered the gates of Rome and \ldots have found their place there. The Derridean fear of being accomodated, appropriated, embraced by the philosophical discourse was well founded because it was based on equally one-sided, as it was deep, understanding of this discourse.After the initial fascination, seduced by vague promises of something new and different, even general public gets quickly tired of \wo{writing otherwise}, \wo{speaking otherwise}, all these \wo{otherwise} which, eventually, turn out to be nothing else than the other, ignored side of the discourse against which they tried to protest or, often, just a new way of saying the old things.%%% `thinking otherwise' is in Book II. level of actuality\paThe barbarians have won, they upset the Rome, its order and its life. But there is a great danger in a great victory. And now comes the time of defeat, of settling down, of accomodating to the culture which lasted some thousands years not by a mere accident, not by a mere misunderstanding,but because it was founded on something real. The barbarians have won because they had a good point to make or, in any case, because Rome did not have anything to counter them. But the noice of victorious entrance is but a passing news, and the horses on which one makes one's tryumph will soon be weary and have to be replaced. One thinks that conquering Rome everything has to be renewed, started anew; one lies down new foundations, challanges to new ways of building, living \ldots yes, thinking. And what? A short time passes and it turns out that people think as they used to, that people live as they used to, that the same emotions and passions steer their lives. The only things which, possibly (but even that not necessarily) have changed are the cloths. I do not believe in \wo{thinking otherwise} and, to a large extent, I abhore most of \wo{otherwise writing}. The barbarians overlook, in their tryumph, that the conquered traditions had developed the ways for accomodating all aspects of experience and that it did it, exactly, in constant confrontation with life. They were not neglected, they might only have been invisible at the places which attracted the eyes of newcommers. \paThe power of the \wo{metaphysics of actuality}\footnote{I am reserving the word \wo{presence} for something else, so I have to translate this phrase in the above way.} needed undeniably a correction. But this can only be a correction of attitude. As long as one attempts \wo{to think}, one will do it in familiar categories. And it is hardly to be expected that, because of the fall of Rome, one will stop thinking. The difference may concern the significance one attaches to one's thinking and its results. And, not least, to the results of other's thiking. If everything is merely a question of interpretation then, certainly, most of the texts which one would like to subsume under the \wo{metaphysics of actuality} can, actually, be interpreted in different direction. They certainly are involved into thinking in terms of actuality but the point is -- what thinking is not? It remains to be seen what the hoped for \wo{thinking otherwise} will have to offer. The answer is: \la{nihil novi}.\paBut point taken. Reflection has to watch its steps, that is, it has to carefully observe what it is reflecting over. It has to always keep the clear distance to its object, in order not to confuse it with its reality, in order not to confuse itself with the omnipotent power of control. This is, exactly, the difference of attitude. And, for that, possibly a nonexistent one because, although some earlier thinkers might certainly be accused of nourishing such a belief, many could not. Just like the texts enscribe to an extent the conclusions, so does the choice of focus determine, first, the choice of texts and, then, the way of reading them. The attitude may be only assumed in the other -- it can be controlled, if at all, only in onself. Especially, when one reads. Discovering an attitude of \wo{fascination with the actual} in all the texts, the possible question is about the attitude of the reader. In short, it is not a question of \wo{thinking, speaking, writing otherwise} but rather of {\em reading} otherwise or, perhaps, reading other texts. \wo{Reading otherwise} would simply mean to look for what one cannot find, to look for the traces of thoughts which one thinks are not there. Eventually, one will find them, but this requires a different attitude of reading.\thi{Metaphysics of actuality} is not all of the traditional metaphysics, in any case, not all of the traditional philosophy.\paCritique of \thi{metaphysics of actuality} (Derrida, Heidegger) wants to show something more, \co{non-actual}. Critique of objectivistic system of thought of Hegel by Kierkegaard opposes to it the experience of an individual, not just a common experience, but the fundamental experiences, elaborated through all the depth psychology. My point: the two are the same! The feeling one may get of existential relevance of Derrida, and certainly of Heidegger, is based exactly on that the personal/individual/etc. comes into the world of \co{actualities} through the \co{non-actual}. \paFollow Heidegger's, Derrida's critique of \thi{the metaphysics of actuality}\footnote{I will reserve the word \wo{presence} for something different.} but not his aggressiveness. There is nothing wrong with actuality, it is our way of conceiving the world. There is only something wrong with positing it as the only way of treating everything, all aspects of experience\ldots We are not scared of concepts as Heidegger, and later post-modernists, became.We consider this fear unnecessary, in fact, impossible in length, sometimescomical, sometimes hurtful...\ad{\thi{The linguisting turn}\ldots} \ldots or shall we rather say, \wo{a linguistic twist}?  One has always known that words and languagecan not capture reality.  Not only there is no final, most adequateand true name of God.  Even trying to communnicate most simple factsand situations, when using words, we are forced to distribute theresponsibility between the one who is speaking -- to express himselfas clearly and understandably as possible -- and the one who ishearing -- assuming that he not only knows the language, but also hasthe sufficient background of experience to grasp the meaning of whatone is saying.  This sounds, perhaps, a bit exclusive, even elitistic,and so it is supposed to sound.  \citt{Who hath ears to hear, let himhear.}{Mat.  XIII:9} Success measured exclusively by publicity, by thesheer number of receipents is always -- {\em always}!  -- inverselyproporitional to the value of the thing.  In the domain of spirit,there governs a law opposite to that of mass culture, namely, themore, the worse.  Even deep things, to the extend they are spreadaround and received by many, become superficial, flat and low.\wo{The sky was blue and the sun was shining.} is asinadequate a phrase, if we try to measure it by some some objectiveconformance to reality, as any name has ever been for expressing theessence of God. When we speak, and even more when we write, we assume that the reader fulfills some basic conditions necessary for receiving the message. If, on the other hand, we do not know to whom we are speaking, if we, perhaps, assume that we are speaking to everybody, irrespectively of his knowledge, background, level of intelligence, and what-not, if we, for instance, are merely interested in selling the book to indefinitely large and, consequently, also indefinitely amorphous masses, we can not avoid getting confused. In particular, if we forget that any utterance, and also any text, is an address from somebody to somebody, if we abstract the text from this fundamental relation of intension and meaning, we can not avoid getting confused. \paOne feels proud having recently overcome all these difficulties bythe \thi{discovery} that, as a matter of fact, there is no reality beyond the words, there are no human subjects beyond the text. As any thesis, so also this one can find innumerable reasons and justifications. I certainly won't spend time on reviewing them all. This inhuman abstraction of \thi{textuality}, this invention of intellectual despair over the impossibility to ensnare reality into words, does not deserve much attention. Yet, its wide popularity makes it hard to simply ignore it. The barbarians entered Rome and settled down, but their ways do have reprecussions\ldots\paReasoning, and understanding in general, is a way of using, inventing and arranging \co{signs}. Words are not the only possible \co{signs}, but let us be charitable and take all this \thi{linguisticity} in a very general, probably over-general, sense of semiotics. Without an adequate system of \co{signs}, there is no understanding. Ok, but there is no such thing as \thi{understanding}; there is only and always only understanding {\em of something}. What this something is, is highly vague, and the \thi{linguistic turn} is an attemt to substitute for our lacking, or in any case \co{vague}, understanding of what this is that we are trying to understand, something which apparently is much more precise, well-defined and hence manageable -- the very system of \co{signs} itself. Cetainly, a smart intellectual twist. However, the fact that something is \co{vague}, that we can not put the finger on it, does not mean that it does not exist. \pa Many \thi{linguistically twisted} will agree.  There existssomething but our way of speaking, the language and words we are usedto, are inadequate to capture it.  Therefore, we must \thi{speakotherwise}, \thi{write otherwise}, invent a new language.  The ghostof capturing the reality into words is peeping in through all theholes.  What else, after all, can an intellectual do than to markethis words?  %Among the most prominent (but by no means the only) examplars%of such \thi{writing otherwise} one can probably mention late%Heidegger and Derrida, perhaps, but only perhaps, late Wittgenstein. %These are, as usual, accompanied by a tremendous herd of noisy epigons%who \thi{have seen the light} and start \thi{bubbling otherwise}.%\pa If the reality which one senses beyond the inadequate words isreally a fundamental aspect of human existence, then is it reasonableto assume that we had to wait thousands of years, until the day today,to discover the need for \thi{speaking otherwise}?  Sure, one canalways patronize the past generations pointing out their mistakes. But such patronizing is but an aspect of a positivistic faith in theabsolute character of progress which we are not willing to takewithout any reservations any more, if we at all are willing to acceptit at except, perhaps, for the sphere of technology and civilisation. Perhaps, the men of Reneissance, or of Enlightment inventedparticularly obscure ways of speaking about some aspects of humanexistence, ways which, due to their low value, became particularlypopular.  But there were wise men, too, in those times, weren't there? OK, they were all led astray.  What about the men of Middle Ages?  Ofearly Middle Ages?  Heidegger would say, and what about the Greeks? Indeed, what about them?  But we do not have to follow theidiosyncratic, not to say comical, attempts to revitalize a deadlanguage.  What about Indians, Jews, Chineese?  I do not want to boastwith false modesty, but I find it hard to belive that to address themost fundamental issues we need an entirely new way of \thi{speakingotherwise}.\pa If all history of human culture, in any case, of written humanculture, has been perverted by the inadequate language, then whatmakes us, some of us, today read Plato, Aristotles, Lao Tse, Bible,St.  Augustine?  For my part, I can say for sure that it is not a needto find their mistakes but, on the contrary, the conviction, and Ishould be able to say -- the experience, that they do have somethingimportant to tell me.  I doubt that many others read them only for thesake of intellectual curiosity, deconstructivistic exercise oracademic career.\paOK, so old texts may, sometimes, contain some valuable insights. Or, shall we only say, some valuable words? Do these texts contain anything \thi{in-themselves}, anything which is not read into them by the reader?If text is entirely open to the arbitrariness of the reader and theindeterminacy of possible interpretations, if it has no intension, notruth it tries to communicate, if any system of signs is but an arbitrary invention with but an arbitrary relation to what possibly might be lying outside it, then one might almost agree thatwriting should not involve any attempt to make it understandable andaccessible -- {\em what}, in such a case, should one try to make understandable?  Probably, one does even better resisting any suchattempts and we have been exposed to many examples of such a resistance. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, all texts have been written by humans with some intensions. They may communicate these intensions in better or worse ways, in more or less adequate form, in more or less understandable and plain manner, but intensions are there. And if one does not like the word \wo{intensions}, in particular, any \wo{intensions of the author}, then it will still suffice that, having been written by humans, they contain human expressions of human experience and life. This, at least, is more than sufficient for me and if it isn't for you, then you are free to keep dissolving words, expressions and, eventually, insights in the mud of \thi{intertextuality}.No private language -- so, no private thinking?language -- changing, ok, but still not changing and translatableNew problems? New solutions? What? -- check it out, it has all been there\ldots\pa A completely different, even opposite, dimension of the\thi{linguisitic twist} is analytical philosophy.  A name which seemsmore adequate to me would be something like \wo{logical analysis oflinguistic behaviour} because, as a matter of fact, I have foundextremely little and also extremely meagre philosophy in this camp. This, however, is due only to my biased and misunderstood conceptionof philosophy, so let us not quarrel about the names.The strength and, indeed, the visible vital force of this camp isbased on the fact that it tries to focus on more or less identifiableand well-defined problems.  The resulting insights and proposals haveoften much intrinsic value and I am last to deny that.  I am a bitmore unsure what this value is and to what purposes it could be used,except for possible applications in cognitive science, artificialintelligence, linguistics and, perhaps, legal theory and new design ofdictionaries.  Even if only of pragmatic -- shall we say, scientific? -- relevance, so, being usable, they also represent some kind ofvalue.  I want to say this with all due emphasis because, having saidthat, I think we can leave this camp for itself.  Hopefully, withtime, it will, as any scientific community earlier in history,establish its identity independently from philosophy and then continueresolving all its specific problems and particular issues with theundisturbed peace of mind to the best of whoever will want to usethem.%\sep %\pa This is as much I have to say about all the linguistic twistingand I leave writing of the voluminous binds of history and analyses ofthe involved \thi{problems}, \thi{questions} and -- yes!  --\thi{solutions} to the competent scholars.\ad{Genealogy}Not in time, but from virtual to concrete $\sim$ gradual differentiationThen: refinement of systems of things/concepts; these consist of simultaneous $\sim$ equiprimordial \ldots correlates/aspects (find a good word)\ad{Notation}\begin{itemize}\item ``\herenow'' \impl ``here and now'': dissociation of aspects\item ``\co{recognition}'' \impl ``\co{re-cognition}'': rozpad into more detailed parts.\end{itemize}ntuitions should be preserved -- for more detailed understantding, one should first keep in mind the possible presence of another notational variant, and then check it \ldots} % end the main \noo{%END
