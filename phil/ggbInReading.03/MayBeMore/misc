\tsep{???}


\pa Eventually, there is only one reality, not a totality of
things-in-themselves but \co{the One} -- the rest are \co{distinctions} made
relatively to the \co{distinguishing} beings.  All these \co{distinctions} have
thus a seed of `objectivity', even if not the fully crisp character of
\co{objectified distinctions}. 
%
Every sentient being has thus its mode of
`objectivity' which reaches more or less to the level of \co{objective
experience}.  Originating in \co{the One}, our time is as `objective'
as the time of $X$'s, $Y$'s or ants.  That all these times may have
entirely different character does not make any of them more or less
`objective' than others.

\pa This, by the way, goes for everything we are saying. Every \co{distinction}
is as \thi{subjective} as it is \thi{objective} -- it requires a being so
distinguishing, but it distinguish something which \thi{is there}. Independently
from this being? Well, this is a further distinction. Here let us only say that
\co{objective externalisation}, whether of a particular thing, time or space,
consists precisely in experiencing it as so independent. Whether I discover a
law of astronomy which tells me how stars are going to move millenia after I
have died, or else whether I realise that \citet{love would not be love unless
  it could carry one to crime}{Varieties}{quoting Bourget,
XI:ftnt.2\kilde{p.263}}, I discover \thi{objective} facts -- they do not apply
only to my understanding, but they pressupose a being who is capable of a
similar understanding. (A life at the level of subatomic particles might be
equally indifferent to both.)

\say, or see if you can say, that \thi{time is the experience of
time}; just like, at the levels \co{above actuality}, Being=Thinking
\ldots I am not much interested in distinguishing objective space,
time and how these possibly give rise to our representations thereof. 
And so, I generally tend and like to identify the \thi{objective $X$} 
with the \thi{experience of this $X$} which again is very much the 
same as the \thi{constitution of this $X$}, even though in all 
admirable pedantry the two may have nothing to do with each other.

%\subsubi{Univocity}
\pa\label{pa:univocity} \wo{To be} signifies nothing determinable because it
merely places anything, whatever is \co{distinguished}, in its indistinct
\co{origin}.  \co{Distinction} only secondarily is a \co{distinction} (and even
later a \co{dissociation}) of $A$ from $B$; primarily, it is \co{distinction} of
$x$ from the indisitinct background.
%
 Consider, \citet{for instance, when
  somebody, approaching from a distance, causes in me a sense-perception with
  the help of which I can judge only that what I see is an existent. In this
  case it is clear that my first abstractive congnition (first, that is, in
  order of origination) is the cognition of existence, and of nothing less
  general; consequently it is not a specific concept nor a concept proper to a
  singular thing.}{OckQuod}{I:q.13 \noo{p.29}} The example illustrates well the
intended meaning of \co{distinction} as \thi{the first}, perhaps \co{vague} and
indefinite, and yet \co{clear} intuition of \thi{something being there}.\ftnt{We
  certainly won't here follow Ockham in his insistence on the merely
  \thi{abstractive} character of this \thi{cognition}, that is one \citef{by
    which it cannot be evidently known whether a contingent fact exists or does
    not exist}{OckOrd}{, Prologue:q1 \noo{p.23}}.  The example seems, on the contrary,
  to indicate that it is \thi{intuitive cognition}, i.e., one \citf{that enables
    us to know whether the thing exists or not}{Ibid.}.  This latter
  \thi{cognition} seemed to require a precise grasp of the \thi{individual
    thing}, and our point is precisely the opposite -- the existence of a thing,
  its \co{that}, although \co{actually} not preceding its \thi{what},
  is nevertheless logically prior and remains \co{above} all more precise determinations
  of its nature, character, or properties.}
%
The primacy of this intuition, the primacy of being \co{distinguished}, is also
expressed by Ockham's radicalisation of Scotus' principle of individuation by
simply renouncing it. We do not follow his absolute dualism and radical
empiricism admitting only 
existence of \co{dissociated} individuals, but (mis)interpreting, among other
expressions, also 
\thi{singularity} as somewhat akin to \thi{being distinguished}, we can accept
the observation that \citet{[b]ecause singularity immediately befits that to
  which it belongs, therefore it cannot befit it through something else;
  therefore if something is singular, it is singular by itself.}{OckOrd}{
  I:d2.q6 \para 85 [translated by John Kilcullen]} 

As John Duns Scotus pointed out, we can grasp that something is without
grasping whether it is a substance or an accident, or let's put it more
generally, without grasping what it is.  The celebrated equivocity of \wo{is},
of \wo{to be}, is only the equivocity of \co{distinction} -- \co{distinguished}
contents may have nothing in common, no common genus, no links of similarity,
except for being \co{distinguished}.  \ftnt{We won't, however, reduce this to a
  mere \thi{formal concept} (an act of mind or concept merely representing an
  object), as opposed to \thi{objective concept} (the represented objects), for
  this distinction arises only as a consequence of the assumed \co{dissociation}
  (and leads to a repetition of the whole debate at another level of
  abstraction). To be \co{distinguished} is not to be a formal or other concept,
  a mere mental accident -- it is to {\em be}.}  And as soon as something is
\co{distinguished}, it 
{\em is}.  The copula lends its subjects the universal privilege of
participation in Being, of being \co{distinguished}.  \citet{For all beings
  participate in Being.  Therefore, if participation is removed from all beings,
  there remains simplest Being itself, which is the essence of all things.
  [...]  when I mentally remove all the things that participate Being, nothing
  seems to remain.}{DDI}{, I:17.51 [We said the copula, but we actually mean 
  \wo{to be} in any form of use, certainly when used as a \thi{substantial verb}
  (to exist), but also when used as a copula and even as an \thi{adjectival
    verb} (\thi{is} in \thi{is running}).]} As Scotus, Ockham and many others
maintained, \wo{to be} is 
perfectly univocal -- as 
\co{distinction}, it is \citet{the first act, the first division}{EckGodOne}{,
  [big p.226]}, \citet{the most perfect of all things,
%  for it is compared to all things as that by which they are made actual;
% for nothing has actuality except so far as it exists. Hence existence is that
% which actuates all things, even their forms. Therefore
  [...] it is not compared to other things as the receiver is to the received;
  but rather as the received to the receiver. When therefore I speak of the
  existence of man, or horse, or anything else, existence is considered a formal
  principle, and as something received; and not as that which exists.}{SumTh}{,
  I:q4.a1.ad3} The celebrated equivocity is but the possibly unlimited
differentiation of the distinguished contents. In fact, \citet{the difference
  between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on
  reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs.  Since
  you have the latter to explain the former, you do not also need \thi{exist} to
  be polysemic.}{Fodor}{III:p.54. [Ockham's identification of \la{esse} or
  \la{essentia} with \la{existentia} seems to be an early form of this claim.
%
  \citef{[E]ssence and existence are not two things.  On the contrary, the words
    \wo{thing} and \wo{to be} signify one and the same thing, but the one in the
    manner of a noun and the other in the manner of a verb [\ldots] there is no
    more reason to imagine that essence is indifferent in regard to being and
    non-being, than that it is indifferent in regard to being an essence and not
    being an essence.  For as an essence may exist and may not exist, so an
    essence may be an essence and may not be an essence.}{OckSumLog}{,
    III:II.c.xxvii \noo{\citaft{OckAll}{, p.92-4}} }
%    Philosophical Writings, p.92-4)}.]
  This is a general tendency of analytically oriented philosophy. (Another
  example \citef{There are as many kinds of existential statements, as there are
    kinds of the objects of discourse.}{MalcolmOnto}{ [after
    Filozofia Religii (fragmenty filozofii analitycznej), p.112]}) The
  difference is that it renounces \thi{existence} as a predicate for its
  conceptual emptiness and, at the same time, seems to renounce it completely.
  This is but the fallacy of liguisticism for which all that accounts for a
  predicate is its extension, and for which the only acceptable argument is from
  the common usage of the language. The interesting issues concern exactly
  different intentions ascribed to the same extension and even more the
  \co{distinctions} which precede any \co{actual} intentions.  We retain
  \thi{being} as the most fundamental \thi{statement} which, for the most,
  remains unsaid or only implicit, but whose effect has been achieved underneath
  and before the \co{actual} discourse.}


\pa
We won't let grammar mislead us, grammar pointing out that saying
\wo{to be distinguished}, we already use the word \wo{be}.  It is only
grammar, besides only English or German grammar.\ftnt{In
Scandinavian languages, for instance, the passive form does not
require the usage of \wo{to be}.  \wo{{\AA} v{\ae}re betyr {\aa}
skilles} says, literally, \wo{To be means (to be) distinguished},
where the paranthesised (to be) simply does not occur and where the
apparently active \wo{skilles}, \wo{to distinguish itself}, has a
marvelous ambiguity involving equally the passive aspect of
\wo{(being) distinguished} (as in \wo{ting skilles ...} which is as 
much \wo{things are distinguished...} as \wo{things distinguish 
themselves...}).}
%
Thus, while to \co{exist} is to \co{distinguish}, \la{existere est
  distinguere}, so instead of Berkeley's \la{esse est percipi} (which arises from the
same intuition), we would say \la{esse est distingui}.
%
%or even better (?) \la{esse est distinguere}.

The universality of \ldots -- the concept?  the idea?  the intuition?  -- no, of
the \co{experience} of \thi{to be} is coextensive with the universality of
\co{distinguishing}, that is, with all life.  Brought to the level of language,
there is, of course, no need for a particular form, a particular verb.  But as
Derrida, quoting Benveniste, observes discussing the transcategoriality of
\wo{to be}: \citet{the 
  strangeness is in the facts -- that the verb of existence, out of all verbs,
  has this privilege of being present in an utterance in which it does not
  appear.}{DerCopula}{:The Remainder as Supplement... p.202 [One may also recall
  here the semitic languages which dispense with the use of \thi{to
    be} as copula and express it in the nominative sentences (e.g., \wo{Pegasus
    winged horse.} for \wo{Pegasus is a winged horse.}).]}  It is there, and it
is everywhere, because every word and gesture brings in a \co{distinctions},
while without \co{distinctions} there would be no world and, consequently, no
words.

%\subsubi{Universality}

\pa\label{pa:dreamsAre}\label{pa:universality} But wait, is there anything which
we do not \co{distinguish}? Are we saying that {\em everything} is? Yes er are.
And dreams, and square circles, and Pegasus? Ok, we would say \wo{Pegasus is a
  horse with wings} or something like that. A cheap, grammatical trick would be
to point to the \wo{is} in this sentence, but we do not rely fully on mere language
usage, let alone, grammar.\noo{Such grammatical tricks and linguistic
  observations are, of course, relative to the language or language group.
  Semitic languages do not use \thi{to be} as a copula: in Hebrew, for instance,
  one forms instead noun clauses or even noun sentences, like \wo{Pegasus-winged
    horse}.} Of course, that Pegasus {\em is}. It is in a very different way
than the horse out there, but still it is, it is \co{distinguished}, even much
more, it is \co{distinguished} as something.  That it, perhaps, does not have
material existence, that it is not a living being, that it is a concept or a
mythical figure are truths which do not in the slightest affect the fact that it
{\em is} -- whenever somebody is able and willing to \co{distinguish} such a
thing.  Even \citet{fictions are from God, because some of them are mental
  entities, some vocal, some written signs, and all of these are real beings and
  thus are from God, just as lies are from God, since they are real
  entities.}{OckQuod}{III:q.3\noo{p.130} [As is often the case, we do not have
  to subscribe to the details of the argument.]} There is nothing wrong with
\thi{being} of a thought -- a thought {\em is} as much as a horse, a table, or a
meaningful relationship.


\pa Then, it seems, \thi{being} loses all specificity of meaning.

Yet, Kant too recognises the \thi{reality} of \thi{being} as distinguishability
from (what he understands by) experience, namely, \citet{that knowledge of this
  object is also possible \la{a posteriori} [...] Our consciousness of all
  existence (whether immediately through perception, or mediately through
  inferences which connect something with perception) belongs exclusively to the
  unity of experience [...] }{CrPR}{I:2nd Division.3.4, A601/B629} The
significant difference concerns not only our generous, as compared to Kant's,
notion of \co{experience}, but that being is by no means limited to it (neither
in our, nor even less in Kantian sense).

The dream I had yesterday {\em is}, the image, the phantom of 
perfection I am chasting {\em is}, the illusions I nourish {\em are}, 
the feeling I have {\em is}. That they are all \thi{subjective} is a 
further differentiation of the \co{distinguished} beings, in this 
case, into those which are relative only to one person and 
those which are relative to many, even all. But populism and 
consensus is no measure of \thi{reality}, although it is certainly the measure
of the \thi{reality about which there is a consensus}.

Interesting and in some contexts even relevant as such distinctions may be, they
are not very useful to us.  They lead invariably to positing some form of being
as \thi{{\em the} being}, \thi{{\em the} real}, and delegating all others to some sphere
of \thi{unreality}.

\noo{Parmenides seems to have been the only one among the Greeks
who resisted the temptation to disgrace some forms of Being as \thi{unreal} --
\citt{ungriechisch wie kein andrer in den zwei Jahrhunderten des tragischen
  Zeitalters [\ldots]}{Nietzsche, {\em Die Philosophie in tragischen Zeitalter
    der Griechen}, 381 [Parmenides, p.45]} His identification of Being with
non-Being, \citt{die volle Perversit\"{a}t des Denkens}{Nietzsche, {\em Die
    Philosophie in tragischen Zeitalter der Griechen}, 386 [Parmenides, p.46]}
is, in our language, the \equin\ of \co{One} and Many, the structural
co-presence of \co{aspects} which can be \co{distinguished} but not
\co{dissociated}.
}

\thi{Reality}, this invention of the Greek philosophers (for which, however,
they seem to have had no word), when opposed to anything, in particular to the
mind as something mind-independent,
%scared by the possibility of mistake, called eventually \wo{subjectivity})
%fighting against the mythological and religious tradition (or whatever other
%demons were hunting them),
becomes but a metaphysical extension of the \co{actual} \co{dissociation}
\co{subject}-\co{object}. There is a very small, often imperceptible
transition from the question about the ultimate principle of everything to the
exclusion from the reality of everything which does not conform to the
\thi{discovered} principle. But a principle which would embrace absolutely
everything can hardly have any content -- principles tend to (if not must)
exclude something, if not for other reasons so simply because they are
formulated in some specific, not to mention \co{precise}, language and concepts.  
\thi{Reality} arises as 
a supposed medicine against the insecurity and
uncertainty of a \co{subject} which is offered only truth reduced to the \co{precise},
\co{reflectively} comprehensible \thi{objectivity}. And then, immediately,
follows the search for the infallible, \thi{real} criteria of \thi{reality}.
The Greek \thi{fall} from the reality of myths to the \thi{true reality} of
philosophy, praised as much as it always has been for laying down the foundations of
science and rationality, was primarily drawing the \co{distinction}, in fact,
\co{dissociating} the \thi{real} from the \thi{unreal}.  But there is nothing
unreal. How could there be? It takes a lot of disappointment to rise suspicion,
and then a lot of suspicion to claim that reality consists of two parts:
\thi{real} and \thi{unreal}.

Everything {\em is}, or else there is no thing, there is nothing,
which is not, about which one could not -- in one or another, but always
meaningful way -- say that it is. \citeti{It is and it is not so, that it is
  not.}{Parmenides}{DK 28B2} Once you start pointing at something, you
\co{distinguish} it and hence -- it {\em is}.  \citet{Being itself is manifold
  within itself, and whatever else you may name has Being.}{Plotinus}{V:3.13}
Everything is and this seems like another side of the fact that it is so hard to
say something which could not possibly make any sense.  The equivocity of \wo{to
  be} is the equivocity of all the differences which we can \co{distinguish};
its univocity is the universality and univocity of the fact of \co{distinguishing}.


%\subsubi{relative, and yet objective (not Berkeley)}

\pa\label{pa:keepDistinguish} Surely, one may keep distinguishing
different ways of being: something being relative {\em exclusively} to my act or
experience versus something relative also to the experience of others, something
relative exclusively to my thought or also to my perception, something relative
to human experience in general versus something relative to the corresponding
experience of ants, etc. But all such
are secondary \co{distinctions}, in particular, the supposed \thi{realities}
they postulate are invariably of a limited scope: the \thi{physicalist reality}
is threatened by the \thi{reality of subjective qualia}, the \thi{reality of
  perception} by the \thi{reality of feelings}, the \thi{reality of my life} by
the \thi{reality common to all}, the \thi{reality of public
  consensus} by the \thi{reality of personal convictions}.  The richness of the
possible \co{distinctions} is only the richness of our world. But the search for
the \thi{true reality}, for something which is both determinate and not relative
to 
our way of \co{existing}, leads invariably towards the abyss of inaccessible and
unimagineable \thi{things in themselves}. 

\pa
\citet{[T]here can be no things with determinate natures unless there are
  true descriptions, and no true descriptions unless the intellect is already at
  work.}{ClarkPlotIntell}{ p.429} Adjusting the Plotinian vocabulary, we would say
that every thing, everything that is, is relative to some (\co{distinguishing})
\co{existence}.   

The problem with accepting such a claim is the same as with imagining that
something which is once \co{distinguished}, could remain undistinguished.  Say,
this table, if I died now, it still would be there, wouldn't it? What does one
mean by this \wo{still}? One means that if, when I died, somebody else came here
and looked, he would \co{distinguish} this table, too. Sure -- it is not
relative exclusively to \co{my existence}. But if only most primitive bacteria
were left...? No! Even if nobody were around, the table still would be there. It
would be there, perhaps, in the sense of a potential \co{distinction} to be made
by somebody capable of it. But if we imagine (let us keep imagining for a while)
that til the end of the world the only living organisms were such that the
presence or absence of this table could not possibly make any difference to
them, what sense would it make to say that it is there? 
As Berkeley observed, such an insistence on its being there, independently of me or
anybody \co{distinguishing} it, harbours a vicious circularity. First we
\co{distinguish} a thing and then pretend that it did not matter.  But insisting
on {\em this} thing being there is exactly saying that somebody might
\co{distinguish} it again, in fact, is sticking to this very \co{distinction} in
the very moment one tries to ignore it.\ftnt{\citef{[T]here is nothing easier
    than to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a
    closet, and nobody by to perceive them. I answer, you may so, there is no
    difficulty in it; but what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in
    your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees, and the same time
    omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you
    yourself perceive or think of them all the while?}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para
    23}\noo{ A few more remarks on the difference between perceiving and
  \co{distinguishing}, and the relation to Berkeley follow in the next paragraphs.}}

\pa We should probably make a brief comment on the relation to Berkeleyan
idealism.  For are we not actually reducing ontology to epistemology, being to
being perceived? No, we are not.

First, there is a difference between our \co{distinction} and perception. The
latter is the category of \co{actuality}, and Berkeleyan idealism suffers from
phenomenalism and nominalism for this reason. Restricting being to being
perceived, he reduces being to pure \co{actuality} and everything (not only
so vehemently criticised abstract ideas) transcending this horizon becomes
... \thi{unreal}. 

Furthermore, the \co{actuality} involves one into the dualism of
\co{subject}-\co{object}, so naturally conflated with that of
\thi{mind}-\thi{matter}. Berkeley gets rid of the latter but the dualism remains
effective, both in argumenation and, as we believe, in his thinking.
\citet{Ideas imprinted on the sense are real things, or do really exist; this we
  do not deny, but we deny they can subsist without the minds which perceive
  them, or that they are resemblances of any archetypes existing without the
  mind;}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 90} One could perhaps invent a distinction
between \thi{real} and \thi{subsisting} allowing one to accept the former and
deny the latter. As it happens, Berkeley can accept the real, continuous
existence of things subsisting without our minds, only because they subsist in
God's mind. This is again the disturbance caused by the mere \co{actual}
perception. For us, a table left unperceived in a room keeps existing
undisturbed, because we all go around with the understanding that it is there --
it is \co{distinguished} also when it is not \co{actually} perceived by
anybody.\ftnt{\citef{For what precisely is meant by saying that the world
    existed before any human consciousness? An example of what is meant is that
    the earth originally issued from a primitive nebula from which the
    combination of conditions necessary to life was absent. But every one of
    these words, like every equation in physics, presupposes {\em our}
    pre-scientific experience of the world, and this reference to the world in
    which we {\em live} goes to make up the proposition's valid meaning. Nothing
    will ever bring home to my comprehension what a nebula that no one sees
    could possibly be.}{PontyPerc}{III:2\kilde{p.432}}}

This, of course, still involves the relativity to the \co{distinguishing
  existence}. But here we are touching upon the main difference -- existence of
things \thi{in the mind}.  \citet{Thing or Being is the most general name of
  all: it comprehends under it two kinds entirely distinct and heterogenous, and
  which have nothing common but the name, viz. spirits and ideas. The former are
  active, indivisible substances; the latter are intert, fleeting, dependent
  beings, which subsist not by themselves, but are supported by, or exist in
  minds or spiritual substances.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 89} Just like the
previous quote, we could accept this one almost without any changes, except for
a minor detail which turns out to be the crucial difference: beings which
\wo{are supported by, or exist in minds of spiritual substances}. The vocabulary
of \wo{being supported by} and \wo{substances} should be taken very seriously
here, for the point is that things exist as if they were mere accidents of
spiritual substances. This is much more than our claim of relativity to
\co{existence}. Things are \co{distinguished}
{\em by} \co{existence} (or mind, to keep it closer to Berkeley's vocabulary,
though not his concepts), but the \co{distinctions} are made {\em in} the
\co{indistinct}.  I do not draw \co{distinctions} {\em in} my mind while you
{\em in} yours, we all draw them in the \co{one} and the same \co{indistinct}.
We may draw them differently, but this is another point.

\noo{\begin{itemize}
\item   
\citet{we have been led into very dangerous errors, by supposing a twofold
  existence of the objects of sense -- the one intelligible in the mind, the
  other real and without the mind; whereby unthinking things are thought to have
  a natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by
  spirits.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 86} + relative distinctions
\item     
  Berkeley is determined by the dualism sense-soul, matter-spirit and
  impossibility of getting-out: \citet{I do not see how the testimony of sense
  can be alleged as a proof for the existence of anything which is not perceived
  by sense.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 40}

  \citet{[I]f there were external bodies, it is impossible we should ever come
  to know it; and if there were not, we might have the very same reasons to
  think there were that we have now.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 20}
\end{itemize}
}


\pa For things which exist only \thi{in the minds} to be \thi{objective}, some
universal and \thi{objective mind} is indeed needed.\ftnt{The \thi{mind} need
  not be God and can, of
  course, enter in various disguises.  \citef{That is, there is no thing which
    is in-itself in the sense of not being relative to the mind though things
    which are relative to the mind doubtless are, apart from that
    relation.}{PierceFourIncap}{ p.68} They are \thi{apart from that relation}
  only because we imagine others who appear in our place with the same
  capacities to \co{distinguish}.  This leads to Pierce's notion of reality
  (repeated by other prophets of consensus or ideal rationality), namely,
  \citefib{that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally
    result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and
    you}{PierceFourIncap}{p.69}, which further implies that \wo{this conception
    essentially involves the notion of {\sc community}, without definite limits,
    and capable of a definite increase of knowledge.}  It was hardly Pierce's
  intention to make reality relative to a consensus, that is, eventually to a
  \thi{mind}. But, apparently, it did not take Durkheim to replace God with society. 
  Starting with \thi{minds} opposed to \thi{reality} and then
  thinking the latter in terms of a \thi{totality of things}, as is typically
  the case with the scientific bias, makes the reality appear as an
  inaccessible epistemological terminus, an \thi{ideal limit} of cognitive or
  experimental development.  Pierce's \thi{reality} suffers from the hangover of
  Kantian independent \thi{things in themselves} and Platonic immovability which
  fit very badly with the 
  \thi{collection of {\em distinct} things}. Eventual consensus seems to provide
  a solution to this very opposition.  But do I need any consensus to {\em know}
  that the edge of the fiord at which I am standing is real?  Do you need any
  consensus to {\em know} that the beauty of the view is real?  The eventual
  reality is the \co{one} which \co{founds}, rather than is founded by, any
  possible community.  All \co{distinctions} have their reality \co{founded} in
  the \co{one}.  The distinctions between \thi{subjective} and \thi{objective},
  \thi{inner} and \thi{outer}, or \thi{private} and \thi{common}, are
  distinctions {\em within} the real, not ones founding it.}
But this is not so for things which are only discovered by, and hence only
relative to, the mind.  Not only \thi{being relative} does not contradict
\thi{being {objective}} but belongs -- even, belongs essentially -- to the
latter. One can
not specify anything claiming its objective existence without having first
\co{distinguished} it. And \co{distinctions} are relative.   What concrete things appear (are \co{distinguished}) depends on the
organism and we certainly live in very different worlds than ants do. But the fact that a
thing appears for an ant and not for us does not make it less \thi{objective} or
\thi{real} -- at most, only less relevant for us.  This relativity does not
deprive the appearances of any \thi{realtiy} or \thi{objectivity}.
%
Existing \thi{in the minds} (whatever that might mean) involves dependence on
these minds. But relativity to an \co{existence} does not require (nor imply)
dependence on this \co{existence}. A daltonist and I can see the same object as
having different colours -- our perceptions of it are relative (to our minds,
including organs of perception). But they are not dependent on, in the sense of
being caused by, our minds.\ftnt{We face here the possible ambiguity of the word
  \wo{dependence} which may involve only necessary but also sufficient reasons.
  We tend to take \wo{relativity} as meaning the necessary reasons -- without
  \co{existence}, no \co{distinctions} -- while \wo{dependence} as causal
  dependence, meaning the sufficient reasons or efficient causes.}
\co{Existence} does not generate \co{distinctions}, it encounters them, meets
them in the \co{indistinct} -- this is the sense of \co{confrontation} with
respect to the spehre of the \co{distinguished}.
%
Consequently, what is being \co{distinguished} are not mere appearances but the
very things 
which {\em are}.  This does not, of course, mean that all \co{distinctions} are
equally adequate, or that no mistakes are possible, but truth and adequacy are
just categories of relating some (set of) \co{distinctions} to another, and we
will take it up at some later time.  Things are \co{distinguished} {\em from}
the background which remains their \co{origin}.
\co{Distinctions} do not turn them into mere \thi{appearances}, in the sense of
something distinguished from, perhaps even opposed to some \thi{reality}.
\co{Dsitinctions}, and eventually also \co{reflection}, \thi{create} things of
\co{experience} (or these things \thi{subsist} only \thi{supported by} the
\co{distinguishing} \thi{minds}) only in the sense that other people might
\co{experience} things differently, while other beings might \co{experience}
entirely different things.

But freedom of such a \thi{creation} does not mean
arbitrariness or voluntariness.  What is \co{distinguished} is but a reflection
of the \co{indistinct}, it comes {\em from} the \co{origin} and is made {\em
  into} it.  Each \co{distinction} is made {\em from} the \co{indistinct One},
and this \thi{from} for ever leaves the stamp of objectivity on whatever is
\co{distinguished}.
%The fact that appearance of something is dependent on being \co{distinguished}
%does not mean that this something is \thi{created} by so being
%\co{distinguished}.
Every \co{distinction} is a reflection of Being, reflects the possibility of
being \co{distinguished}, or else a \co{distinction} of Being. Once a
\co{distinction} has been made, it becomes ineradicable, unerasable -- it can
acquire entirely new sense, it can be modified, it can be declared
\thi{untrue}, it can hide in deeper layers of
\co{virtuality} -- but once made it can not be un-made. This is the primal ground for
the emergence of objectivity (as well as not so infrequent insistence with which
we stick to once acquired opinions). But this does not mean that we were not
involved.  The \co{distinctions} made by ants reflect something of the world as
much as the \co{distinctions} made by us. But when one maintains that if
humankind died out, the same things would still {\em be} in the world, one
assumes a human \co{existence} in this world -- departed by all humans -- to
whom these things still make difference.

Now sure, I do \co{distinguish} a lot of things as being \co{objectively}
distinct, as being distinct independently from my acts of \co{distinguishing}.
{}
Thus we are indeed conflating \thi{\co{objective} being of $x$} with a
recognition, or \co{an experience} of \thi{$x$ {\em as} \co{objective}}. There
is no \co{object}, nothing \co{objective} if there is no \co{subject}.
\thi{Objective being of $x$} unrecognised, unexperienced, not \co{distinguished}
by {\em any} \co{existence} is contradictory and, in any case, irrelevant.  But
we allow this conflation only
\begin{enumerate}\MyLPar
\item with respect to particular $x$, particular \thi{what} below the
  \co{absolute that} which \co{transcends} all \co{distinctions};
\item because below \co{that} every \thi{what} (and \co{objective} \thi{what}s
  are only particular cases) is relative to the \co{distinguishing existence},
  and finally
\item because \co{recognition} and \co{experience} are something more than any
  \co{subjective} decision -- I do not {\em decide} or {\em choose} to consider
  something as \co{objective}, I always encounter it as such.\ftnt{Relativity
    has nothing to do with voluntary choices. The fact that \co{distinction} of
    the green color of the tree over there is relative to my
    being-here-and-looking-at-the-tree does not mean that I have any choice
    about seeing it green. This \co{distinction} (as most \co{distinctions})
    happens above the level of \co{actual} and volitional choices. More
    generally, it is relative not only to my \co{existence}, but rather to the
    {\em form} of \co{existence} capable of making such a \co{distinction}.
    This point may remind of transcendental idealim in Husserlian version, but
    it is only the last point on the list.}

In short, \co{distinctions} are relative, but it does not make them unreal in
any sense. Relativity to a \co{subject} is an aspect of their \co{objectivity},
in the technical sense to be specified in Book II, but also in any at least
slightly \co{concrete}, that is, not completely \co{dissociated} sense of the
word -- the differences may only concern the scope of this relativity.

\pa Eventually, there is only one reality, not a totality of
things-in-themselves but \co{the One} -- the rest are \co{distinctions} made
relatively to the \co{distinguishing} beings.  All these \co{distinctions} have
thus a seed of `objectivity', even if not the fully crisp character of
\co{objectified distinctions}. 
%
Every sentient being has thus its mode of
`objectivity' which reaches more or less to the level of \co{objective
experience}.  Originating in \co{the One}, our time is as `objective'
as the time of $X$'s, $Y$'s or ants.  That all these times may have
entirely different character does not make any of them more or less
`objective' than others.

\pa This, by the way, goes for everything we are saying. Every \co{distinction}
is as \thi{subjective} as it is \thi{objective} -- it requires a being so
distinguishing, but it distinguish something which \thi{is there}. Independently
from this being? Well, this is a further distinction. Here let us only say that
\co{objective externalisation}, whether of a particular thing, time or space,
consists precisely in experiencing it as so independent. Whether I discover a
law of astronomy which tells me how stars are going to move millenia after I
have died, or else whether I realise that \citet{love would not be love unless
  it could carry one to crime}{Varieties}{quoting Bourget,
XI:ftnt.2\kilde{p.263}}, I discover \thi{objective} facts -- they do not apply
only to my understanding, but they pressupose a being who is capable of a
similar understanding. (A life at the level of subatomic particles might be
equally indifferent to both.)

\pa
We may always attempt to view everything from the perspective of
\co{objectivity}, of \co{externalised}, independent \co{objects}.  But
this is what science does and it does not interest me too much. 
\co{Objective} time has negligible existential relevance.  The
paradoxes of its beginning and (im)possibility of its passage reflect
the impossibility of dissociating these `objective' terms from their
experiential basis, from the \co{origin} and experience of one's
unity.\footnote{The concept of `simultaneity', presupposing the
\co{atual} experience and so vehemently criticised by Bergson in
relativity theory, is another example of the experiential foundation
of apparently `objective' notions.} From the existential point of
view, it is much more relevant to consider what aspects are involved
in the experience of \co{objective} time, and also what precedes it. 
Starting from the purely \co{objective} time, most significant aspects
of life would be hard, if at all possible, to account for, just like
starting from the pure `objectivity', most such aspects end up 
labeled as  \thi{unreal}.

\say, or see if you can say, that \thi{time is the experience of
time}; just like, at the levels \co{above actuality}, Being=Thinking
\ldots I am not much interested in distinguishing objective space,
time and how these possibly give rise to our representations thereof. 
And so, I generally tend and like to identify the \thi{objective $X$} 
with the \thi{experience of this $X$} which again is very much the 
same as the \thi{constitution of this $X$}, even though in all 
admirable pedantry the two may have nothing to do with each other.
