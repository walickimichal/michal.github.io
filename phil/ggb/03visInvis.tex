But we live surrounded bythings which are \thi{greater than us}, things which, although sometimes  can be, to some extend, modeled successfully as \co{complex totalities}, cannot be embraced completely by a network of \co{concepts} and rules.  These\thi{things}, slipping out of our grasp and control are not, however, outside our reach, theyare not inaccessible infinities \thi{in themselves}.  They too are\co{distinctions} which have been made after we were \co{born} and are part ofour \co{experience}. They are announced by various \co{signs} and by all the\co{traces} which permeate every \co{actuality}. They are \co{present}, albeitnever as entirely \co{actual}, \co{precise} and fully transparent \co{objects} of\co{reflection}.\citet{Know that the knowable things are of two kinds. Some can be described by  means of definitions, while others can not be defined.}{Ibn}{III:\para 25\label{cit:Ibn}} Inthe most mundane sense, the \co{invisibles} are what \wo{can not be defined},what can not be encircled within the \hoa.  Speaking of love as the paramountexample of such an undefinable experience, Ibn`Arabi continues \wo{It is  known by him in whom it lives and whose object it becomes, while the person is  unable to understand its nature nor negate its reality.}$^{\ref{cit:Ibn}}$ Inability tograsp \thi{what} does not exclude perfect awareness of \co{that}. In theeventual limit, \co{invisibles} dissolve in the mere \co{that} of the\co{origin}, leaving all \thi{whats} to the finitude of understanding.  Even ifconsciousness notices some \co{invisibles}, it has completely differentcharacter from the thematic, positional consciousness of a \co{visible} content.\co{Invisibles} present themselves always as essentially \co{transcending} the\co{actual consciousness}, as inexhaustible by it, as touching theedge of eternity.\pa\citet{Now the created soul of man hath [...] two eyes. The one  is the power of seeing into eternity, the other of seeing into time and the  creatures, of perceiving how they differ from each other [...], of giving life  and needful things to the body, and ordering and governing it for the  best.}{TheolGerm}{VII. There are multiple examples of apparently similar  duality, as e.g.: \citef{I am a member of two orders: the one purely    spiritual, in which I rule by my will alone; the other sensuous, in which I    operate by my deed.}{FichteVocation}{III;p.140} In our terms, these two orders are both within the sphere of \co{visibility}. Similarly, Hugh of St.~Victor  distinguished the \thi{eye of the flesh}, by which we perceive external world  and the \thi{eye of the reason}, by which we attain knowledge of  ourselves. But with him both were, in turn, distinct   from the \thi{eye of contemplation}, which allows us to achieve knowledge of  things \co{above} us. %   Moreover, being a borderline implies that neither of the orders is%   \thi{purely} this or that. There is no \thi{purely spiritual} order, for there%   is no \co{spirit} which is not \co{incarnated} in the flesh. This Book will%   clarify such issues.}%An individual is a borderline between \co{visible} and \co{invisible} -- this isthe existential situation. It is irrevocable and does not depend on anythingparticular, on the level of his understanding, on the scope of his knowledge, onhis character or life experience.  Yet it is not, for this reason, formal, it isnot related to the concrete qualities of different lives as form is (supposed torelate) to matter.  It is, in fact, \co{experienced} through and through,encircling the horizon within which this particular life, as well as every otherlife, unfolds. The \co{invisibles present} in every \co{actuality} are what giveit its full, lived \co{concreteness}.  All concrete \co{experiences} are woveninto the interplay of the \LL\ and \HH.  No matter to which level one directs\co{reflection}, no matter what are the predominant feelings and inspirations ofone's life, this life's fundamental character is determined by the experienceand attitude toward the sphere of \HH\ and \LL, by the way in which oneexperiences and moulds the borderline between them.%\pa%[In this sense it is absolute -- but is our relation to the Absolute the same%as our relation to this situation, i.e., to the fact that we are between \HH\ and \LL?]%%Absolute -- always present, but never identical with anything (imm. %\& transc.)%This is the {\em existential} situation.  The \HH\ is not something which ismerely \wo{not known}.  Knowledge, especially in the philosophical tradition,might have functioned as an image of this situation, where reason was placedbetween the \thi{known} and \thi{unknown}.  But it is a poor analogy.The distinction \thi{known}-\thi{unknown} places us at the level of\co{actuality}, it carries the character of a contradiction, of an absoluteopposition and, moreover, of \co{objectivistic attitude} -- the \thi{unknown} iseither irrelevant emptiness or a determinate \thi{knowable}, even if for thetime being it remains unknown. %For a knowledge oriented person, it seems important what he knows and, possibly,what he does not know but would like to know. This positivistic element veilscompletely (though not necessarily) the fact which is important: that no matterhow much and what one knows, it is always limited and surrounded by theimmovable horizon of the \thi{unknown}. This fact, trivial as it is, has thefundamental existential import.Being a borderline is a \co{concrete} expression of \co{existential  confrontation}. It is not merely formal but thoroughly \co{concrete} becauseman, transcending himself, lives only his own limits.  The \co{confrontation}itself is never \co{actually experienced}, is never \thi{given} as an\co{object} of adequate understanding; it manifests itself as the constant\co{presence} of something \co{above}, witnessed to by the occasional \co{signs}and by the constant \co{traces} connecting what is \co{actually visible} to its\co{invisible} origins. Being a borderline is a \co{concrete} expression of\co{existence} as \co{participation} -- perhaps not yet a \co{concrete  participation}, which consists in {\em actually being} on the \co{trace}, butat first only the simple \co{participation} of the {\em mere intimation} of the\co{trace}, the {\em mere intimation} of being surrounded by \co{invisibles}which remain \co{dissociated} from their \co{signs}, remote and not \co{present  concretely}. The impossibility of grasping this \co{presence} can suggest thatone should turn away from it and concentrate on the plain \co{visibility}, thussecuring that one's being will not be devoured by the surrounding \co{chaos}.But remoteness, the \co{distance}, is reflected as a constant \co{thirst} -- andwhen pushed to the extreme \co{dissociation}, even as despair -- of the\co{soul}, for \citet{the desire for the bliss, which she had lost, remained  with her even after the  Fall.}{Periphyseon}{IV:777C-D\kilde{88}\label{ftnt:afterFall}} But attractedthus by the inexpressible promises and \co{vague} reminiscences, one can end upin the abyss. Attempting to bring them into \co{this world}, to explicate theirintricacies, to grasp them in the language and concepts, one risks dissolvingall \co{actuality}, concepts and \co{signs} in the incomprehensible mesh whichconstantly tries and never manages to capture the \co{vague clarity} of the\co{experienced} intimations. Neither attitude -- that of the apparently safedismissal and sobriety, nor that of the gnostic fascination and ecstasy -- seemssatisfactory, not to say, complete. But being a borderline, we balance betweenthe two. Abstract as this balancing might seem, it is the fundamental, the most\co{concrete} border we draw in our \co{existence}.%\vspace*{-1ex}%\section{The existential situation}% \secQQQ{7}{Because the soul has the potentiality of knowing all things, it % never rests until it comes to the first image where all things are % one.

Adults keepputting the last brick on the construction they have been rising all the time, the last detailneeded to complete the perfect totality -- and having put it, find another onewhich needs to be put, but only one, the last one, and then another\ldots Or else,they throw dim looks far away, to the places of the next visit on the other endof the earth, to the remote, half real places they can hardly imagine, like themagical atmosphere of the childhood home.  Old people thirst only for the thirstof their youth; or, perhaps, liberated from the past as much as from the future,for the tranquil withdrawal from theactuality.  The poor thirst for the easiness of affluence and the rich for theresistance of the world and matter without which reality seems to dissolve in decadence. As Goethe says, \woo{man thirsts constantly for what he  is not.}{p.21} We are never entirely satisfied with our achievements,and we are never entirely satisfied with whatever we obtain from gratuitousgenerosity. And if one rests satisfied, when one stops thirsting, it is saidthat he has lost the taste for life.\citeti{We are as if we were not.}{Heraclitus}{DK 22B49a  \noo{\citaft{Vorsokr}{}\citaft{Powrot}{p.42}}} There is something which entersour \co{experience} only as \co{thirst}; it is not longing for anythingspecific, even if in most situations one will fill the objectless character ofthis \co{thirst} with something graspable, will give it a name, and hence agoal. But it is not longing for\ldots, not a thirst for\ldots  -- it is simply\co{thirst}, without any object, without any goal. True goals remain hiddenuntil they are reached.\pa \co{Thirst} does not show anything \co{visible}; if we were to talk aboutits correlate, its noematic intention, it could only be \co{nothingness};\co{nothing} appearing through the entirely negative noesis, the experience oflack, perhaps even a loss. Yet, this seemingly negative noesis, this apparent\co{nothingness}, has a thoroughly positive character. For \co{thirst} announcessomething which -- by the very fact of being \co{thirsted} for -- representssome good, and -- by being \co{thirsted} for indefinitely and undefinably,incessantly and indelibly -- perhaps something \co{absolutely} good. It mightseem that what is so announced remains \thi{absent} and that the wholeannouncement amounts to nothing but announcing its \thi{absence}.  The negativeexperiential content, \thi{absence}, may indeed seem to be not merely ananalogical \la{modus significandi}, but strangely inadequate way of presentingthe intended, fully positive \la{res significata}.  \citeti{Not understanding,  although they have heard, they are like deaf. The proverb bears witness to  them: <<Present yet absent.>>}{Heraclitus}{DK 22B34} For all that appearsnegative and inadequate only when we expect things, \co{objects},\thi{substances}, \co{visible} images, in short, \co{actualities}. For only thenwe consider \co{non-actuality} to be an \thi{absence}, a lack. This\thi{absence}, however, is a thoroughly positive \co{presence}, and \co{thirst},this sense of incompleteness, is the genuine bridge over the borderlineseparating \co{this} and \co{another world}.  \citet{That our good is There is  shown by the very love inborn with the soul; [...] the soul, other than God  but sprung from Him, must needs love.}{Plotinus}{VI:9.9\noo{Of course, there    is no need for any \co{actual} love, for any \co{acts}. This, as for    instance Duns Scotus called it, \wo{natural love} is the ontological    relation of perfectability that exists between the \co{actual existence} and    that which perfects it.}} And thus \thi{remembering}, one keeps looking.\citet{Sometimes I feel as if I were approaching happiness and I stand before a  flower that blossoms through an old stone wall and I am unable to draw nearer.  I am left with the feeling of always waiting for happiness, and everything is  suddenly diminished by the melancholy of having once being able to achieve  that joy.}{LouR}{Rilke's letter from 16.03.1914, p.66} This remembrance ofapparent loss, this \co{thirst}, \thi{natural love} and desire of\thi{Something}, is the first form of \co{invisible presence} in \co{actual  experience}.  Before elaborating this point, a few \co{impressions}.\noo{\pa There are no guarantees.  Not only the goals remain hidden, but\co{reflection}, being a \co{concrete reflection} of this particularperson, has no unambiguous and \co{precise} \co{signs} it couldfollow.  The \co{invisibles} are not prone to such \co{signs} and,indeed, every person may need to travel a different way, must travelhis own way.  The only possible guidelines are as \co{vague} -- and\co{clear} -- as the \co{invisibles} themselves.  \co{Invisibles} donot \co{command} a determinate course of action, but man has to directhis attention towards \co{invisible} to bring heaven and earthtogether.}%\vspace*{-1ex}\subsubsection{The moods of silence}%\vspace*{-1ex}\citet{Silence is a fence around  wisdom.}{MaimoTraits}{\citaft{EvilFaces}{p.72}\noo{The Many Faces of Evil,    p.72}\label{cit:fence}} Nowhere, nowhere and never happens more than in amoment of silence -- for silence is the voice of God. \citet{I am the taste of  living waters and the light of the sun and the moon [...], sound in silence  [...]/ I am the silence of hidden mysteries; and I am the knowledge of those  who know.}{Bhagavad}{VII:8/X:38} But used to the voices, we can't hear thesilence and searching for \co{visible signs}, we keep \co{thirsting} for what\co{transcends} them.\begin{verse}{\small{\emThen Theotormon broke his silence, and he answered:"Tell me what is the night or day to one o'erflowd with woe?\\Tell me what is a thought? \& of what substance is it made?\\Tell me what is a joy? \& in what gardens do joys grow?\\And in what rivers swim the sorrows? and upon what mountains\\Wave shadows of discontent? and in what houses dwell the wretched\\Drunken with woe, forgotten, and shut up from cold despair?Tell me where dwell the thoughts, forgotten till thou call them forth?\\Tell me where dwell the joys of old! \& where the ancient loves?\\And when will they renew again \& the night of oblivion past?\\That I might traverse times \& spaces far remote and bring\\Comforts into a present sorrow and a night of pain.\\Where goest thou, O thought? to what remote land is thy flight?\\If thou returnest to the present moment of affliction\\Wilt thou bring comforts on thy wings and dews and honey and balm,\\Or poison from the desert wilds, from the eyes of the envier?"\ftnt{\citeauthor*{BlakeAlbion}. In Blake's poetry, Theotormon represents thirst, desire which, when suppressed and restrained, turns into envy or greed.}}}\end{verse}%\input{031MoodsOfSilence}%lasting pain\pa Have you ever felt the constancy of a pain, vague and indefiniteor, perhaps, clean-cut and if not with a known source, then at leastwith a clearly recognisable target, pain which did not leave any spacefor hope, whose intensity was spread over the soul or rooted in thebody so that no point was adequate to begin recovery in which youcould trust?  Have you? Pain which might have lasted for years so that, eventually, it became a companion, almost a friend, on whom you could rely, who you could be sure will visit you again, but whomyou never wished to meet directly, whom you always tried to avoid, pretending that you are not at home, whenever the doorbell rang.\noo{\citt{A woman passed by the window yesterday morning and when the last glimpse of her died out in my eyes, she had taken almost all of my tenderness away with her.I would like to describe this in detail because I believe it is one of the few vital experiences possible to a [terminally] sick man or a prisoner [for life].(May it not be at least conjectured that the sick and the imprisoned in our midst form the top-soil out of which grows all that is beautiful and desirable in the backyard of this ugly mill?)I saw the faint outline of her long-distance-veiled face, but the face itself -- the thing one might live and dream with -- I did not catch a glimpse of.

The emptiness of crowded streets, unreal cities, wastelands? Have you ever been at the outermost cliffs,%of loneliness, far from Dover, not peaceful coast of sunny Californian Pacific, but remote and desolate, stony beaches of Faroe Islands, empty, like mathematical line curved in the frozen magma of an Icelandic mountain, in the steepness of a Norwegian fiord, stone under ice, blown with the wind, and waves, not singing, not enchanting, but dividing anddivided, those which stay, and those which return\ldots unceasingly, without purpose\ldots\pa%longingHave you ever felt the emptiness of infinite longing, the emptiness which filledthe whole world, the whole life, the whole universe with the unbearable beautyof its silence.  Have you?  The emptiness which does not negate the things ofthis world but which presses its presence between them, which surrounds themwith full respect and recognition, and yet\ldots makes them all appearinsignificant, that is, disappear.  The emptiness which is not void, which isnot absence but, on the contrary, the fact, the feeling, the presence whichmeets the longing at the horizon where the ineffable dawns, and thus, where itlanguishes in calm.  The emptiness which is all and only correlate of thislonging, because you know that you are not having a yen for this or that, for abetter house, nor for a nicer company, for more success, nor for more happiness.Such things, real and satisfying as they might be, would not suffice.  You arenot longing for anything, and yet you are longing\ldots This is not a longingfor the impossible, rather, an impossible longing, often, aroused by a minorthing, an inspiringly resigned tune of Celtic quietude, Irish flute, by a stormybreeze on an empty beach boulevard among the faded tables and withered benches,by the light of the moon diminishing in the dark waters of an evening lake, by apassing woman reminding you of the impossibility of Love.  But these are onlysigns, impressions, psychological reminders.\pa%dreamsAnd all the good dreams, understood or not, dreams of foreign lands, ofremote islands, of shiny future, believed and unbelievable. Day-dreams of theultimate fulfillments, hardly admitted and only vaguely felt, withunrecognisable contents though recurring moods, arising in a morning from theashes left by the nightmares of their failures.

Have you ever felt that everything is in perfect order, sothat it hardly could be better or neater, that you have everythingyou wanted and yet, something is missing, that you have nothing tocomplain about and yet \ldotsAnd if you felt it, haven't you then tried first to ignore it, and then eitherto find something which \co{actually} was missing to fill the gap, or else to dosomething which could occupy your mind and your hands, which could at leastserve some useful, even if tiny, purpose?\pa Under all the attempts to think that the meaning is more specific, thatthere was a goal, that all is about something more definite, there hidesunquenchable \co{thirst}.  Awaiting new things, important events, the mostsignificant solutions, we flirt with time, yearning for eternity. And the deeperwe yearn, the more intensely we flirt. It seems that a \citet{mere trifle  consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.}{Pensees}{II:136} But any momentdevoid of the hope of eternity becomes a desperate expectation of the nextmoment. One may reach the point where mere novelty, multiplication and\wo{increase are the highest and only goal}, although even the preachers ofblind differentiation\noo{Dewey's or Rorty's kind} know thatthis is usually called \wo{cancer}.  The \co{thirst} is not for this or that,and so it can not be quenched by anything, least of all, by \co{more} ofanything.  It may turn into incessant and restless search, into constantattempts to acquire \co{more} or experience something new, but \wo{avarice is  serving the idols}.

But now, when all the masks have fallen, no face appears -- and bare emptiness stares into one's face. One tries to fill it with this or that, with some old ornew \co{idol}, with work, fascinations or orgies, eventually also to pretendthat, since \co{actually} nothing has happened so nothing has happenedreally.

Ixion, havingfallen in love with Hera, dreams of possessing her and makes successful advances(in some versions, Centaurs are the offspring resulting from their intercourse).His boasting of having had slept with a goddess is, however, a result of anillusion: he slept with a cloud which Zeus created in resemblance of Hera. Thus,trying to reach a goddess, he catches the air and, as a punishment, he is boundto a wheel on which he is whirled by winds for all eternity. Heaven is, accordingto the Greeks, always a {\em gift} from gods. The vanity of any attempts toreach it by one's own means recurs with figures like Bellerophon, Icarus,Prometheus.  Such attempts, although deserving further punishment from gods, are themselves\co{signs} of already being in despair. The time spent onunsuccessful attempts to escape begins gradually to suggest: there is no escape!One may try to look for reasons and explanations, that is, for excuses and theguilty ones (\wo{Hell is the others!} cries Sartre behind the \btit{Closed  doors}\ftnt{The US title of the play was \btit{No Exit}.}), one may confront one's own sinfulness (\citet{Angstdiscovers freedom but this is the same as discovery of sin}{Angest}{V\noo{p.212++} [modified]}), but all that does not change anything:from emptiness, where there are no walls, there is no exit either.

But wesense the need to justify suicide by ascribing it the element of freedom inaddition to, or perhaps even instead of, the reactive character of ultimatedespair. (In Mainl\"{a}nder, the universal fact of the death of finite beings iseven called the \wo{will of death}, though in humans and living beings ingeneral this metaphysical, even divine, will of death is covered up bythe apparent \wo{will of life}.)\pa\label{suic=no} The negative character of this freedom (if freedom it is) isobvious -- it is a door of escape, \thi{liberation from\ldots}.  Over 50\% ofstudied suicide attempts are classified as individuals trying to achievesurcease. The rest are either trying to \thi{manipulate} the environment (tohave revenge on a rejecting lover, to ruin the life of another person, to havethe final word in an argument as in the so called \wo{altruistic suicide}) orare combinations of both: surcease and manipulation.

One might, perhaps, discern an element ofheroism in attempting such a free \co{act} in the depth of spiritualenslavement, in sacrificing one's life when confronted with a higher truth.  Butit is lamentable when this higher truth turns out to be nothing and the apparentfreedom is only escape.\ftnt{Admissibility of suicide is always an expression of  absolutisation of the \co{visibility} beyond which nothing can be~\ldots seen.  The dignified suicide of a samurai or a Roman official, as the last way of  preserving one's honor, perhaps even of expressing one's respect for the one  commanding the suicide, is probably the best example of reducing human  \co{existence} to a tool of the social system. Suicide is also often defended  by reference to the need of preserving one's dignity and self-respect in the  face of unbearable suffering. The complexity of the issue eludes any simple  judgments but we would, nevertheless, point out that taking one's life amounts  to ingratitude for this ultimate \co{gift}.

It is now \citet{despairing of forgiveness, when someone because of  the extent of his sins completely gives up hope in God's  goodness.}{AbelardEthics}{\para 177} It is now accepting one's despair, tryingto turn it into something good.

It knows, like Milton's Satan and all his associates know, that itwished and still wishes good, something good, which here meansexit.

Just likeone can not be happy in the evil world, one can not be damned in the middle ofsaints and saved. \citet{To the unhappy, it is a comfort to have had companions  in misfortune.}{FaustMarlowe}{V:42. (The Latin version -- \la{Solamen miseris    socios habuisse doloris} -- was quoted by many authors, but its origin  remains unknown.)} And when companions are hard to find, one starts producingthem by demonstrating the universality of misfortune.  \citet{[T]he more I  see\lin   Pleasures about me, so much more I feel\lin Torment within  me,}{Milton}{IX:119-121} says Satan who can nothing else but try \citetib{all  pleasure to destroy,\lin Save what is in destroying; other joy To me is  lost.}{Milton}{IX:477-479} \citet{Rebelling against all existence, it thinks  it has acquired evidence against existence, against its goodness.

Damnationfinds its \co{expression} in every single thing and situation, it permeates all\co{actuality}, even when it itself remains non-\co{actualised}.  It is, afterall, the very impossibility of \co{actualisation} for it has removed everythingwhich possibly might be \co{actualised}; equating the ultimate \co{invisibility}with emptiness, it has cut away the source of \co{actualising} meanings and,eventually, turns even \co{actuality} into nothingness. Only absolute emptinesscan be absolutely insatiable. Insatiability, the impossibility of satisfaction,is a substantialisation of \co{thirst}: like Thyestes devouring his own body,like Tantalus ever hungry and never able to reach the water and fruit brushinghis lips.  Insatiability of damnation is to spread its despair over all andeverything, in search for a community beyond its \co{alienation}. \citet{Man  communicates by means of despair when he no longer has any other  community.}{Suicide}{III:6.\kilde{p.101} Durkheim speaks here only about the  tendency to, what he calls, \wo{egoistic suicide}, arising from the  dissolution of social structures and increased individualisation or, as we  might perhaps say, alienation. \wo{The individual's appetite for life    diminishes because the connections relating it to the society are weakened.}  We would not identify our \co{alienation} with Durkheim's  \thi{individualisation}, just like we would never identify \co{absolute} with  \thi{society}.

The lack of exit means that \citet{no end is limited to  damned souls,}{FaustMarlowe}{XIX:171. (\wo{limited} meaning here appointed, fixed  definitely.)} means the eternity of damnation. (\thi{Bad eternity}, ofcourse, infinite temporal duration, for the damned remains thoroughly withintime.)  The only relief one can then find consists in the confirmation that\wo{damnation is the truth}, that \wo{so is the world}, that \wo{hope is an  illusion}.  Extreme pain soothes lesser pain; common degeneration in the worldaround seems to attenuate my own degeneration; nothing seems to allay more themeaninglessness of the private suffering and despair than the realization thatthis is actually the universal truth of life. It would be futile to ask whatcomes first -- suffering or the perception of its common (if not universal)nature. Suffering is indistinguishable from its \co{experience}, while\wo{universal}, \wo{common}, etc. are here only \co{actualised expressions} ofthe \thi{objective} character of evil, of the fact that it overcomes \co{me}, is\thi{greater than me}.  At this last circle of despair, the suppressed\co{thirst} solidifies, one could say, {substantialises} the ultimate emptinessas a universal truth. But since this \co{actual} truth is not any truth, one isbound to keep searching for its confirmations.\noo{\komWiezienie = ``pragnienie'' bycia wiezniem [Tischner 98,191]; Milton (used:224[71]!), 175[85-9],(used: 176[142-3])\komwiec nic nie bede robil {\em z tym}. Choose -- on my own; and do -- myself (Milton 152[105ff], 179[252]) whatever Ican still do (Mammon, imitate Heaven 179-80)it is only now that Satan turns against Man, that is, everything becomesmore and more \co{visible} \komwill stay here and cherish it/destroy for others: Evil be thou my good, 182ff +(used? 224[71]!), w naturze potepienia lezy uniwersalizacja potepienia [Tischner191] 246[937-8], revenge 167[605ff], destroy for others 246-7[939-40]} % end \noo\sep\pa What we have called \wo{despair} Kierkegaard would classify as only itshigher stages, perhaps, as \wo{the despair which is conscious of being  despair}. Already our \co{thirst} would be classified by him as lower levelsof despair. Indeed, the stages of the gradual intensification of \co{thirst} todespair referred to above correspond closely to the intensification of despairdescribed by Kierkegaard in \btit{The sickness unto death}, I:C.B.\btit{Despair viewed  under the aspect of consciousness.} So, what's the difference? Is there any?We certainly do not want to be so dramatic, for life is not. There may behumility in \co{thirst} which would be hard to find in despair. But we alsosense a significant difference. What we said in \refp{pa:thirst} about thecommonality of \co{thirst}, might have been expressed by Kierkegaard, forinstance, as follows: \citet{An older woman who has supposedly left all illusion  behind is often found to be fantastically deluded, as much as a young girl, of  how happy she was then, how beautiful, etc. This \la{fuimus} [we have been],  which we so often hear from older people, is just as great an illusion as the  younger people's illusions of the future; they lie or invent, both of  them.}{Despair}{I:C.B.b.$\alpha$.1 \kilde{p.89}} All that is probably true,in a sense, but it is not right. If people \wo{invent or lie} and they do sothroughout the whole history of mankind, then the problem lies rather in thediagnosis than in the diagnosed.  \co{Thirst}, as we shall see, is not somethingwhich, like Kierkegaard's despair, one just has to dissolve in activeconsciousness. It certainly is not, as is despair, a sin which cannot avoiddeepening \co{alienation}. And this is the crucial difference -- Kierkegaard insists on akind of consciousness: \citetib{what characterises despair is just this -- that  it is ignorant of being despair.}{Despair}{I:C.B.a\kilde{p.75}} Yet,\citetib{the more consciousness, the more intense despair,}{Despair}{I:C.B.a\kilde{p.72}}%   this might probably expire, cos `consciousness' will eventually%   mean `right understanding' and this, in turn `being saved'. But no, see%   Socratic definition of sin II:2 [120ff]}and so it seems we have a slight problem with the relation between consciousnessand spirituality. The two seem often simply identified, \citetib{inwards, at an  even higher level of consciousness}{Despair}{II:B\kilde{p.141}}, as if inwardswas impossible without \co{actual} consciousness. Perhaps, it is only a minor technicality in need of a properinterpretation, but it seems to harbour the fundamental conflict ofKierkegaard's, of which the tension between the intensity of actualconsciousness and the passivity of the spiritless (bourgeois) is only anepitome.  \citetib{But despair is exactly man's unconsciousness of being  characterised as spirit.[...] Most people live without being properly  conscious of being characterised as spirit -- and to this one can trace all  the so-called security, contentment with life, etc., which is exactly  despair.}{Despair}{I:B \kilde{p.55-56}} Such desperate classifications (smelling if not gnosis, then Lutheran pietism and sense of sinfulness)we are unable to share. Being \thi{properly  conscious} of anything is no goal of life, neither is seeing {\em desperate} involvement in every world involvement, especially in the secure and contentone. Sure, one can attempt a bit sharper interpretation, giving moreplausibility to this opposition. But we think it is unnecessary because whatcounts in Kierkegaard's, as in any other philosophy, is the fundamental mood,the fundamental truth which it elaborates in all possible forms.  The mood ofKierkegaard is that of a dramatic tension, yeah, of a prophecy arising from theopposition to the neglect and disrespect shown by the world, by \wo{the small  market town}, to the higher, spiritual things.  There may certainly be a tension between the twoelements, but spiritualising consciousness makes it into an unbearable contradiction.  The result seems quite a bit unhealthy, especially, if we takeinto account that \citetib{[h]ealth is in general to be able to resolve  contradictions.}{Despair}{I:C.A.b.$\beta$ \kilde{p.70}} Kierkegaard is the unresolvedcontradiction between the two poles: an individual, free spiritual existence and theworld sunk in impersonal spiritlessness. If you like, it is the contradictionbetween the self, founded in the relation to God, and God himself, whom the selfcan not reach through mere consciousness. Whichever form, we do not want to end in thesame point. If the world is an enjoyable place of comfort and (why not?aesthetic) content, then the goal is not to leave it. And if the world isimpersonal, inauthentic, despairing, then the goal is not to leave it either.One lives in \co{this world}, and the fact that its platitudes andspiritlessness can sometimes feel discouraging does not mean that spirit livessomewhere else. If it lives anywhere, it is only in the midst of \co{this  world}, not perhaps {\em in} its \co{dissociated} things and spiritlessactivities, but between them. Such a depersonalised world, such deindividualisedpeople as existentialists, following Kierkegaard, used to describe are \wo{inventions or  lies}, for people appear soonly when viewed through the requirements of plain \co{visibility} andtransparency. The opposition of a reflected personality to the stupefying imagesof mass-media or narrow-minded images of a market town does not extend to thecontradiction between spirit and spiritlessness, nor that betweenfaith and sin. The world one lives in is the world as one is able to seeit. Accusations against it turn out, eventually, to be self-accusations. %Besides the world is {\em as one sees it} -- general thought, idea...Consciousness of despair can certainly intensify the despair, but despair canalso reach quite deep levels without active consciousness.  We have emphasizedthat deepening of despair is, at the bottom, an \co{invisible} process, andrealizing it consciously is only an additional possibility -- certainly,tremendously complicating, but not necessary.  It is unnecessary because onealways somewhat, in the depth of \co{irreflective self-awareness}, knows one's\co{spiritual} condition. This knowledge, however, is not that of \co{actual}consciousness which fully realizes what's going on, whence it comes and wheretoit goes. It is this very inability of \co{actually} seeing whereto theexperienced despair is going which, on the one hand, deepens the despair and, onthe other hand, suggests that the possibility of healing lies elsewhere and notin the autonomy of consciousness.  We will consider this issue in more detail in\ref{sub:beingKnow} but now we are turning to an elaboration of the hermeneuticsof \No.\section{Spiritual choice of No}\label{sec:evil}\pa\label{pa:evilsSuffer}Despair is a form of \co{alienation}, of turning \co{nothingness} into nothingor, what amounts to the same, being cut off from the \co{origin}. It is the\thi{ontological} \co{separation} carried to the \thi{epistemic} extreme of\co{dissociation}. In the \thi{epistemic} categories of \co{actuality}, there isindeed no difference between the two\ldots But this \thi{epistemic} mistake affectsthe whole \thi{ontology} -- for in the sphere of \co{spirit} there is nodistinction between being and knowing. The form of \co{confrontation} is the\co{confrontation} itself, and what and how it is lived determines the\thi{ontological} character of what it encounters. The ultimate emptiness,apparently so abstract and irrelevant for \herenow, once it finds the site inthe depth of one's being will only spread further and further down, puttinggradually more and more regions under its spell. Whether it experiences itselfas evil, or only finds evil in its experience, it is a seed from which more evilarises. For even if evil is at the bottom lack and negativity, it is lack whichpropagates and grows, it is negativity which universalizes itself.%Despair -- and, most generally, evil -- \co{alienates existence} from its%\co{origin}, making the latter appear as empty nothingness, total lack. This%total lack, this ultimate void of emptiness is \he{substantialisation} of%\co{thirst}, effected by the \No, by the denial of the possibility of salvation.\co{Alienation} is the {substantialisation} of \co{thirst} which, unable tomaintain the positive -- even if impossible, \co{object}less and henceunimaginable -- character of its intention, absolutises the negative characterof the experience as absence, as a mere lack.  Despair may for quite a long timeremain in a suspension as to its character -- as suffering, and hence an evilexperience which, however, need not be an experience {\em of} evil. As long asit remains so suspended, it is suffering but it does not become evil.  Equatingthe \co{invisible} possibility with the impossibility of exit, it ceases tosuffer. But it ceases to suffer only because it ceases to feel and know, onlybecause it has now turned its suffering into the \thi{objective} impossibilityof liberation, into the ultimate \co{alienation}, that is, evil. Despair neednot be evil though, in the moment it begins to re-cognise evil behind itssuffering, it is on the way to become it itself. Every evil expresses this\co{alienation} which, unable to stand the suffering, begins to \co{experience}it as a substantial entity and {objectifies} it as \thi{evil} (cause, person,accident, life, world). Thus, distancing itself from it, it becomes alsodistanced from an \co{aspect} of its life and, at the bottom of it, from itssource. Evil, we might say, is suffering which became substantialised, and thusapparently \co{externalised}, in an attempt to escape itself.\wtsep{emergence}\pa Unquenched \co{thirst} brings pain and pain, just like suffering, is a greatdanger; it can infect the \co{soul}.\ftnt{\wo{Pain} can be here taken to refer  generally to all kinds of what is often called \wo{natural evil} -- physical  pain, sickness, natural catastrophes, etc. Hardly any of the following  formulations would require change if we interpreted it this way. We do not  draw rigid distinctions, but \wo{suffering} is meant in the more fundamental  sense, as the personal -- whether physical, emotional, moral or spiritual,  whether only felt or also lived and deeply experienced -- pain, which has  become objectless and is no longer relative to its possible causes.}  \wo{A  hit with a hammer into the head can damage the soul.} The one who is sufferingasks all the questions of Job's and, eventually and inevitably, asks ``Why?''.Left without answer, one grants \co{oneself} the right to accuse thesurroundings, other people, the world -- for undeserved suffering, for neglect,then for injustice, for immorality and, finally, for evil.  \wo{I did not  deserve this! It is evil!} And who are we to know what we deserve and whatwe do not?  Whatever the accusations, at their basis lies \No\ which, havingall the reasons (bad rather than good, but seemingly sufficient) to blame andaccuse, becomes hate. Hatred is not an irrational, unjustified feeling withoutreasons. As anger, according Seneca, it hardly ever occurs without reasons and,typically, it has plenty of reasons for its own justification, it \woo{does  necessarily presuppose an injury, either done, or conceived, or  feared.}{SenecaAbs\kilde{p.19}} It only \citet{proceeds to the resolution of a  revenge, the mind assenting to  it.}{SenecaAbs}{\citaft{EvilFaces}{\kilde{p.22}}} But hatred, again likeanger, \wo{passes the bounds of reason, and carries it away with it} or, as wewould say, it is an expression (one of the strongest ones) of \co{alienation},of the negative separation from the hated \co{object}, person, the other, thealien, which caused my pain.  Then, when the ``why?''  does not find anysatisfying answer, and one is unable to stop dwelling on one's pain, the grantedhatred may embrace the whole world.\ftnt{Self-pity is, in fact, also an  expression of \co{alienation}.  Pitying itself, it dwells in \co{attachment}  which is underlied by the image of \thi{the evil world}, the \thi{evil} which  is out there, against which it is impotent.}% Here could come a formulation about evil as the lack of answer to `why', as% the  lack of justification Suffering which does not disappear grows.  Time heals only wounds which haveceased to cause pain.  But even a negligible pain, if it lasts, turns out to bea constant element of \co{my} life, which may affect deeper and deeper levels of\co{my soul}.  Initially it may affect only \co{my actual} situation which\co{I} am able to face with all the vitality of \co{my actual} strength. \co{I}may gather my strength and say \wo{It hurts but I can stand it}. And sometimesit works.  But if it does not\ldots \co{I} can not distinguish clearly \co{my  soul} from \co{my world}, nor \co{my world} from \co{this world}. A suffering\co{soul} sees only suffering which, eventually, can spread over the whole world.When so it encounters something else, it is a mere appearance, an accident, atransitory insignificance.\pa We do not have to list examples of how pain experienced by children maydeform their personality.  But we should keep in mind that such a pain is notnecessarily a child abuse, a sadistic attitude of the father, or any other plainform of violence.  A molestation, minor annoyances, tokens of indifference orundeserved blame, when confronting a sensitive \co{soul} may be experienced asdeeply hurting and painful.  A mere negligence, or else, high demands andexpectations, when not compensated by the overall atmosphere of love, underlyingcare and understanding may constitute painful experiences. A mere presence of achild at a scene of a humiliation, revile, deception, ravishing, even of asimple quarrel between adults may cause enough pain.\ftnt{The director Robert  Wilson, in cooperation with an anthropologist,   conducted a film analysis of a situation mother-child: the child is crying,the mother lifts it. Split into 300 frames sequence displayed unexpectedlythat, in the first phase, the mother reacts aggressively and that the childresponds with a complex of movements and sounds expressing fear; only then theactions of the mother become caring and protective. The woman did not want tobelieve that. Wilson's conclusion: there are subconscious <<frequencies ofcontact>> below the globalising level of words, exchange of signals so minutethat they can be brought to the surface only by an analysis in slow motion.\citaft{Wolicki}{\kilde{p.170 in Dialog; else: Bettelheim, Cudowne i    Po\.{z}yteczne I, str.24-25}} Recall the difference between the\co{reflectively} registered \thi{substantive parts} and the flowing \thi{transitive parts} in the timeexperience, I:\refpp{fig:nows}. }\pa Evil is primarily a reaction -- a reaction which seems justified, but whichis neither controlled nor even realized. The first form of love -- because it isalso the form of \co{thirst} -- is the need to be loved. Evil is born betweenmen from the lack of love but also, and primarily, from pain caused oftenwithout any intention, as if by accident.  Yet pain, even suffering, need not beevil. It becomes so when one rises a wall of defense against the \thi{evil  world}, against all the forces which bring suffering, when suffering begins to\co{alienate}.\ftnt{Although it is common to consider suffering an evil, we will  not identify them without further ado. The Hebrew language of Old Testament,  for instance, does not even possess an equivalent of \wo{suffering}. The  primitive root \heb{\wo{ra'\'{a}}} means to be bad, displeasing {\em or sad},  and the noun \heb{\wo{ro'\'{a}}} denotes evil or wickedness but is likewise  used for sadness or sorrow (e.g., in Ecc.VII:3, \wo{{\em Sorrow} is better    than laughter: for by the {\em sadness} of the countenance the heart is made    better.})  There are multiple variations which, however, denote suffering  only in special contexts and in derivative sense. E.g., \heb{\wo{tsame'~$\!$}}  = to (suffer) thirst; \heb{\wo{ra'eb}} = to suffer famish; the passive  form\noo{(\la{<<niphal>>})} \heb{\wo{`arek}} of the verb \heb{\wo{`arak}} = to  prolong/be long, means being patient and also to suffer exposure to evil, and  similar associations obtain with words like \heb{\wo{yanach}},  \heb{\wo{nathan}} which, referring primarily to resting, putting down, leaving  or letting go, are also used in passive forms for being inflicted. But there  is no single word capturing the distinction between suffering and evil and the  Greek word for suffering, \heb{\wo{pascho}}, occurs only infrequently in  Septuagint. One could elaborate various speculations on the ways the lack of  this distinction influenced the concept and understanding of evil and justice.  We will, however, keep the distinction for the main reason suggested above and  earlier at the end of \refp{pa:evilsSuffer}: suffering is the \co{experienced}  quality, one would be tempted to say, an essential aspect of human life, while  evil is a consequence or only a conclusion drawn from suffering, as possible  as unnecessary.}There are innumerable ways of causing pain and of suffering, and it would befutile to attempt their classification. It would be futile first of all because, obvious as someof such ways might be, we do not know them alland we can not know them -- it is not a matter for any general classification, butfor the \co{concrete} attention paid to the \co{actual} situations. There are no\co{objective}, \co{visible} criteria not only for what, in more subtle cases,may constitute a {painful} experience, but, above all, not even for whatconsequences inflicted {pain} may have.  An unsatisfied need of a crying babymay turn out just an insignificant accident, but also a first suggestion of alack, on which later disappointments will grow; an aggressive sentence statedcarelessly to the spouse, may happen to be ignored by a child accidentallypresent in the same room, or else it may hit the most sensitive core of itsunderstanding; a misunderstood joke may become a mortal offense.There may be far from such details to evil, but like all \co{actual  experiences}, they too penetrate gradually the soul's \co{virtual} depths.Evil emerges at first as a mere consent to evil, perhaps only ignorance of it,and it emerges from such \thi{misunderstandings} -- it is born between men, butit is born {\em into} them. \subsection{Privative evil}\label{sub:privativum}%{Malum privavium}%(which would do good ever yet forever works evil)% -- \ref{sub:moloch}\pa Emptiness of eventual \co{alienation} is not anything one chooses for itsown sake. At first, it is perhaps only an irrelevant annoyance, a slight threat,then it becomes terrifying and, eventually, turns into a horror, \la{horror vacui}.Nothingness is not anything one chooses at all, for it lies far \co{above} thesphere of possible \co{actual} choices. To begin with, \wo{Nothingness is a  thirst for Something}, as Jacob B\"{o}hme says.  Not knowing what this\thi{Something} might be, it is a confused circling, a search, a desperate --because incessant and indelible -- search for \thi{Something}.  The \co{soul},even the infected \co{soul}, does not want anything evil. But missing\thi{Something}, missing \thi{Something} to believe in and to rest on, it mayget involved in evil as well as in good. This early stage of nihilism -- notknowing what to believe\ftnt{And barely suspecting that nothing can be believed.  It was called \wo{passive nihilism} in \citeauthor*{NihilB}, and in  \citeauthor*{NihilC}.}% [Zur \"{U}berwindung des europ\"{a}ischen Nihilismus (1946/47) in% \citeauthor*{NihilA}], and so does W.~Kraus [, , Frankfurt 1985]}-- may still have all the signs of innocence and undeserved suffering. But it may also, and more typicallyit does, appear in a variety of forms determined by the still functioning\co{idol} (all \co{idols} are also forms of \co{alienation}): as egocentrism, asa self-satisfied activity (which negates all that does not serve its goal), asamiable aesthetism of Dorian Grey (whose soul rots in the closed room), as an American-dream hero (who only occasionally must visit his psychoanalyst), as anobedient functioning of a scrupulous clerk (accidentally, working in aconcentration camp).%Biesy, Martwe duszeAnonymous and impersonal evil grows on the passivity of such a nihilism which,at first, still tries only to find some new \co{idols}.%not knowing what to believe and, consequently, what to do, on the passiveXX-th century has taught us the lesson of the most impersonal workings ofevil; as Hannah Arendt described, it is the mere failure to reflect which accountsfor the impersonal banality of evil.%Thinking and moral considerations: a lecture, in Social Research,%vol.38,no.3,1971; {The Many Faces of Evil]Satan does not any longer visit individuals the way Mephistopheles visitedFaust; he remains invisible and unheard, appears only now and then as a hardlyidentifiable, even if remarkable, person. He acts, as Woland in Bulhakow's\btit{Master and Margarita}, kind of \la{incognito}, impersonally, through otherexecutioners, and only the final results show to the public that devil must havebeen involved.  He is no longer a psychologist but a sociologist, perhaps, apolitician.\ftnt{Another powerful image in modern literature was drawn in  reference to the society suffering equally and from the analogous disease as  the communist Moscow afflicted by Woland. Visiting Leverk\"{u}hn in  \citeauthor*{Faustus}, XXV, devil enters as a petty individual of a very  dubious appearance and social status, but even this personal, or rather  impersonal trait changes several times during the conversation, suggesting the  presence, as effectual as imperceptible, throughout all the layers of the  society and culture.  In 1995 French theologian summarises: \citef{Satan's    greatest success in modern times is replacement of the direct activity --    arising the fear of the devil -- by an organic, imperceptible, and hence    tranquilizing activity, which penetrates the social texture without noise,    devoid of the signature of the prince of this world, run by his agents    occupying appropriate, strategic    positions.}{SatanRene}{p.118\kilde{Diabel,p.139}} In spite of the catholic  insistence on the personal and concrete being of the devil, his workings  appear quite impersonal: \citefi{We know well that this dark, destructive and    disquieting being really exists and acts, preparing against us sophisticated    traps meant to destroy the moral balance of humans.}{Paul VI, 1972, in    \btit{Report on the State of Faith}}{} But this depersonalisation of devil,  his dissolution in impersonal forces, is at least as old as the modern  nihilism. Devil appearing to Ivan Karamazov is a completely average person, an  anonymous member of middle or lower class. In the 1830-ties, Aloysius Bertrand  can see devil penetrating every corner of the social system: \wo{He argues in    the Parliament, leads a defense in the Court, plays on the Stock    Market.}{\citaft{SatanMinois}{VI:2\kilde{p.122}}} Depersonalisation was then  but another side of the romantic acknowledgment and justification of devil  (Clavinhac, Byron, George Sand), followed by the apparent rendering him  harmless in the truly naive (even if powerful) socio-positivistic spirit of  Hugo's \btit{La fin de Satan} or Balzac's \btit{Melmoth r\'{e}concili\'{e}}.  His powerful return in the beginning of the XX-th century tells probably  something about the price of such optimism.}\newp\paEvil of this lowest, most impersonal, but for this reason also the mostglobal kind, is not anything \co{I} choose but something \co{I} participate in,it is \thi{greater than me}. It is unintentional, unwilled, perhaps even wellmeant -- a \wo{force which would do good ever yet forever works evil}. This fact, thatit happens as if in spite of \co{me}, through \co{me} but not by \co{me}, illustrates the aspect of \co{alienation} almost at thepsychological level. Persons affected by Woland become like machines: notbecause they suffer from some form of a %merely psychologicaldepersonalisation disorder, not because they merely {\em feel} detached, not because they cease to think and lose the ability to choose, but because theobjective world has taken away their possibilities to act and choose -- they get involved into situations createdcompletely behind their back, which they can only continue acting withouta slightest possibility of exercising any influence on further development.It is an old mantra that \wo{passivity increases chances for (becoming) evil}that, in the words of Paul Wladimiri, \wo{omission is nothing else but an  alliance with evil} and \wo{truth which is not defended will be defeated}.Are these trivialities? Of course -- if we only assume that \thi{the world is  evil}. The evil of many socio-political systems of the XX-th century left theastonishment: \wo{How can it be possible?}%\wo{People prepare such a  lot for other peopleHumans seem to do all that, but it is inhuman; nobody wants that, and yet ithappens: \citet{all I know is that there is suffering and that there is none  guilty.}{Karam}{Ivan to Alosha in II:V.Pro et contra:4.Rebellion [The Grand  Inquisitor]}Having first declared human beings innocent for the evils for which onlydefective social organisation carries responsibility, it takes now nothing less than brightness and precision of the French-most intellectualism of a sociological provenience to draw the conclusion that \thi{subject must be dead}. Helpless and meaningless as only abstractconcepts can be, once formulated it may however count on a wide popularity-- human \thi{subject} could not possibly effect cruelty, murder and torture onsuch a broad scale. \wo{It was not me! I did not want it, and hence I did not do  it! Nobody wanted it, hence nobody did it!}  Unfortunately, all that happened,and so this petty human \thi{subject} is apparently so insignificant that itmust be declared non-existent.We know well enough that even if \co{subject} has never been more than a deadabstraction, so human person is as alive as it always hasbeen and that \co{I} am as responsible for my acts as \co{I} always have been. Theremoval of human subject amounts, willy nilly, to postulating an analogous center ofsubjectivity at the level of society (whatever that might mean). We can thus sense here the reappearing ambiguity of \thi{subjectivity}vs. \thi{objectivity}, \co{myself} vs \thi{us},%\co{myself} vs. \co{my self}from II:\ref{sub:objsubj} (in particular, \refppf{civObjSubj}). But no matterhow much agency we manage to ascribe to the impersonal forces of culturalformations and socio-political systems, transferring one's responsibility tothem only deepens \co{alienation}. \paThe character of evil can be very impersonal and involvement into it can takethe form of participation which happens beyond, and even in spite of, whatever\thi{subjective} choices and intentions \co{I} might have. But it still needssome necessary conditions which here happen to be the participating individuals.\co{I} participate in evil which is \thi{greater than me}; \co{I} do not havecontrol over its full strength and effects, \co{I} contribute only \co{my} smallpart to the totality which happens to be beyond every single among the involvedindividuals. Nobody controls it! And yet it happens\ldots Perhaps, we should revivethe notion of collective responsibility (as it was done after both World Wars).%more!%In its passive, \co{privative} form, evil can appear everywhere, but it will growonly in certain conditions of axiological passivity. Although it never livesfully in any individual, it is always among us, if not \co{actually} then only\co{virtually}, germinating. But \co{virtuality} is already fully real, andwhen it starts blooming, it may bring forth fruits which are surprisingly and incomparably more sour than the seeds from which they havegrown. The shock of the XX-th century is not madmen like Stalin, Mao or Pol Pot,but the legions of common people who carry out the most inhuman operations --the more inhuman, the higher are the \co{idols} who bless their actions.Theterrifying inhumanity of the genocide on the native Americans is not embodied bythe people like Ltn. Colonel George Custer, U.S. Cavalry soldiers from Wounded KneeCreek, from Bloody Island or other places of Indian massacres.  On the contrary, it emerges through the apparently positive developments (exchange of goods, expansion of the missions)and, eventually, even underneath the genuine and honest attempts to repair thedamages, best wishes of people like John Collier (Roosevelt's chief of the Bureauof Indian Affairs implementing \wo{New Deal} for the natives) -- the inhumanity ofthe genocide whose mere scale excludes any personal guilt, %which not only overcomes any particular evil done to the offers,but which continues {\em in spite of} the increasingly good intentions orbad conscience of the guilty ones.Even if we subtract, in all such cases, the expected amounts of private gain, ofpersonal will to power and money, of resentment and revenge, we are still leftwith legions of~\ldots \thi{normal people} participating in global evil.(Unfortunately, we are dealing with \thi{normal people} even if we do notsubtract anything.) They are legions because to participate in this evil is soeasy, almost natural: just obey the orders, or do your job, or sometimes, do notpay too much attention. Elaborating on this theme of the banality of evil,Oksenberg Rorty observes that corruption \citet{can begin with the perception of injury or threat; or with a  vision of what seems a tantalizing good. A society can become so pervasively  corrupt that its members can typically fail to recognise their  viciousness.}{ARorty}{\kilde{p.283}}\pa\label{pa:originalSin} It seems that we thus encounter something which mightremind of~\ldots the original sin, or at least its possible variant.  We couldcertainly refer to the above paragraphs to counter the unreserved claims ofPelagian flavour that human can freely choose goodness which is in his power andthat sin (as a cause or result -- or both -- of evil) is the matter of everyindividual. It is in one's power to \co{actually} decide, or rather only admit,that one wants something which is good, that one \wo{thirsts for Something}, butone's power ends about there.  \wo{They want good but effect evil, for they know  not what they do.}  As desire for good is fully compatible with it, thisoriginal sin is not an \woo{innate sinful depravity of the heart}{Edwards, I:1.1  \citaft{EvilFaces}{ p.126,131}}, it is not a moral category appealing topersonal consciousness and making it \co{visible} \citet{that the soul of man,  as it is by nature, is in a corrupt, fallen and ruined state,}{Edwards}{I:1.1;  I:1.3} that his \citet{whole nature is a seed of sin; hence it can be only  hateful and abhorrent to God.}{Calvin}{\citaft{EvilFaces}{ p.121}} Wecertainly do not want to get all too puritan, revivalist, Calvinist or Lutheran.In a strange way, it is the sin which anchors individual in the community, thesin which is as if committed only by the community, and therefore one in whicheverybody participates. It is impersonal evil which spreads among individualsaffected by even the slightest degree of despair or nihilism -- it grows andeffects results which might not have been intended by anybody, for which noparticular person \co{actually} carries full responsibility.  Yet, everybody isresponsible for it, so we might say that original sin is one which no individualcommits, but for which every individual is responsible.\ftnt{\label{resp}Thus  this sin, at least in some sense, gathers (while evil divides). Also, it is  not something intended and actually willed (while \citef{[t]here can be no sin    that is not voluntary}{AugustTrueRel}{XIV:27}), and so the followers of  St.~Thomas would call it a sin only in an analogous sense, only a shadow of  sin properly so-called.  Participation in sin implies responsibility for it,  and this is the whole and only sense of its \thi{voluntary character} in the  present context -- for one is responsible for everything one participates in,  even though no \co{actual} willing is involved and no \co{actual}  responsibility can be imputed.    In the older and more traditional societies, the same idea seems to have been  present as the fear of pollution with correlative craving for ritual  purification. Pollution results from \thi{unclean} actions but can also become  infectious or hereditary. (Thus, for instance, there seems to be no signs of  such infectious or hereditary transmission of \gre{miasma} in Homer, but in  the Archaic Age it became both and was accepted as such to the Classical Age.  Plato would still debar from religious or civic activities those who had  voluntary contact with even slightly polluted person, until they have been  purified (\btit{Laws}, 881DE).)\kilde{GreekIr,p.36,ftnt.43} Such involuntary,  uncontrollable and almost mechanic workings of pollution suggest equally  mechanic purification which develops from simple forms performed by laymen in  Homer to advanced rituals of \gre{catharsis} in the Archaic Age.  }Just like the lowest level of despair is characterised by the lack of anyknowledge thereof, so the one (that is, everybody) affected by the original sinhardly ever realizes it, never meets its efficacy in the \co{actuality} of one'sconsciousness, and consequently hardly ever confronts any \co{actual} choice relatedto it. One may still live the ethos of one's parents, family, nation, one maystill be apparently active in all possible ways, yet one is already exposed tothe \co{unclarity} of values and \co{concrete} decisions.  One is not evil -- onthe contrary! Many of Hitler's willing (and unwilling) executioners were decentcitizens; good family fathers were tools of the most inhumanevil.\ftnt{Dostoevsky notes in his Notebook: \wo{In fact, we were the    nihilists, we in the constant search for a superior idea.}}\co{Privative evil} spreads by not being recognised or not being opposedactively enough.

Itsgerms may appear without anybody noticing. We do not know all the conditionsunder which \co{thirst} becomes lack.  In the traditional language, the\thi{natural} predisposition to the emergence of evil, the appearance of evilbetween humans in spite of their natural \co{thirst} for God, was called\wo{original sin}.  Perhaps, it is not a necessary feature of human nature, butit seems to have been always present in human history; it seems to be so common-- and so powerful -- that \co{dissociating} the two might be a futile exerciseof intellectual optimism.\noo{ \kom impersonal, participated-in, unwilled -- Satan is active HERE (and  only here?); only those looking for paradise get to hell (Bellero.., Milton  298[17-20])  creating idols \simu ako. separation/alienation    \kom Evil is (for) the most unintentional; happens through me but not by me  \kom What went wrong? alienation -- why? where from?    \kom All that was at the personal level -- but this is evil of the clerks,  evil of the impersonal machine of a concentration camp...

As there is hardly any \co{distinction} between\co{me} and \co{my world}, the  emptiness of the latter results inthe dissolution of the former. And this is no paradox that emptiness causesdissolution, nor that the indissoluble person disintegrates -- for dissolutionis exactly the \co{alienation} of \co{actuality} from the \co{self} and it iseffected by the emptiness which sneaks in between the two, which\co{dissociates} heaven from earth and, eventually, announces nothingness of the former. What can be observed in \co{actual} situations is alienation fromthe world, from the surroundings and other people, but these are only consequences, only \co{visible signs}. \label{pa:unreality} The common theme underlying this process in all the above mentioned (and others)variants is the sense of unreality: first the \co{invisible} becomes unreal (foronly what is \co{visible} is real), then the world around \co{me}, losing allsense and meaning becomes unreal, too, and finally, even \co{I myself}, \co{my}whole {life} become unreal.

And once completed it, too, offers no exit, for havingembraced everything, having turned everything into unreality, it has leftnothing \thi{real outside}.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{NihilZ} describes 3 stages of  post-Nietzschean nihilism with the last stage being characterised by the whole  reality becoming unreal (albeit, in his case, as a consequence of the fall of  the \co{idol} of collectivism which defines the second stage).  Rilke:  \citef{I really did build my own house and everything that was in it. But it    was an external reality and I did not live and expand with it.

Evilseems to happen to the affected person who is suffering all these calamitiesrather than participating in them, not to mention contributing to them. Is sucha person evil? Hardly. He seems even less evil than the onespassively accepting it -- he only suffers it. Yet this suffering has a maliciouselement of acceptance, just like the second stage of despair was only despairingover one's own situation. He is in a grasp of evil which is much stronger,deeper and more penetrating than the passive, \co{privative evil}.  The\co{alienation} has progressed further, has reached a higher, thatis, deeper level.But he himself does not cause any \co{alienation}, he does not spread evil! Orso, at least, one would like to see it, believing that one is responsibleonly for one's free and voluntary choices. Does he really not spread evil bygoing around (or, for that matter, closing himself \thi{inside}) and being sodeeply affected by it?%Evil brought against oneself is in no way better than evil brought againstsomebody else.\ftnt{Killing oneself is in no way \thi{better} than killing  another. Not because it is worse, but because there is no sense in such a  comparison across different persons. Whatever effects \co{alienation} is evil,  and whatever is evil is so irrespectively of whom it affects. Degree of evil  may be, \co{vaguely}, associated with the degree to which it \co{alienates},  but then, again, irrespectively of the affected person. This may be, perhaps,  referred to as the \thi{objectivity} of evil, though it is in every situation  relative to the affected person and the way in which this person is being  affected.}  OK, perhaps, but {\em he} did {\em not} bring it over himself, ithappened {\em to} him! He needs help, not accusations! But -- everybody may needhelp and nobody needs accusations. We are not accusing anybody. And we admitthat it may be a tantalizing thought that one serves evil in the midst ofopposing it, in spite of all one's hopes and expectations; that one isresponsible for it only because {\em it} has chosen its site in one's soul; thatone is guilty by a strange accident, which accuses one of evil in the middle ofthe fight one leads against it. Unfortunately, every fight witnesses to the\co{presence} of some adversary. And when the adversary is in \co{me}\ldots?Deep suffering, hopelessness, and despair over hopelessness, are ways of beingaffected by evil and, at the same time, of answering for being so affected. Theone suffering is not, of course, evil but he is exposed to a trial in which evilcan easily enter his soul. Prolonged suffering can lead either to\co{externalisation} of evil as some devilish power responsible for exposing one to it, or to recognition of one's own responsibility -- not, perhaps, for anyvoluntary acts and evils but for one's imperfections. Either choice deepens\co{alienation}. \citet{When a man truly Perceiveth and considereth himself, who  and what he is, and findeth himself utterly vile and wicked, and unworthy of  all the comfort and kindness that he hath received from God, or from the  creatures, he falleth into such a deep abasement and despising of himself,  that he thinketh himself unworthy that the earth should bear him, and it  seemeth to him reasonable that all creatures in heaven and earth should rise  up against him and avenge their Creator on him, and should punish and torment  him; and that he were unworthy even of that. And it seemeth to him that he  shall be eternally lost and damned, and a footstool to all the devils in hell,  and that this is right and just and all too little compared to his sins which  he so often and in so many ways hath committed against God his  Creator.}{TheolGerm}{XI. The exclusive emphasis of this aspect would be a bit  one-sided (it is probably one of the most \thi{Lutheran} passages in this work  discovered by Luther), but the description applies well to other forms of this  stage. Stavrogin, for instance, says in his final letter: \citef{I know that I    should kill myself, erase myself from the surface of the earth as a harmful    insect.}{Devils}{III:8.Epilogue\kilde{p.667}} } The legalistic or pietisticbias of such self-depreciation, according to which suffering bears only witnessto the responsibility for some guilt, according to which perhaps every sufferingcalls for responsibility and guilt, is indeed evil consuming one's \co{soul}.\pa Although only half-personal, and hardly chosen (not to mention voluntarychoice), this form of being partakes of evil. And to participate in evil is tobe affected, even consumed, by it (even if we won't say that it is to {\em be}evil). This is a higher, more spiritual level of being a victim, perhaps, avictim of plain violence. Having been exposed to an act of violence does not, byitself, make one evil. But it poses before one a lot of choices which open andstrengthen the possibility of saying \No: the arising will to settle theaccounts, perhaps the conviction about the right to exercise unmitigated revenge,perhaps to nourish hatred, etc..%Even more may be going on behind the scene, in the \co{invisible world}. The\co{alienating} power of the sickness to unreality, not to mention exposure tosuffering, lies in strengthening the tendency to pollute with the appearance ofevil not only particular situations and events but the world -- \thi{the whole  world}, the \co{quality} of \thi{my whole life}, of \thi{human life as such}can begin appearing as evil or as originating in evil.

It is, indeed, possible to balance on the edge of thisapparent contradiction, but it is very difficult. In fact, the more intensity in theattempts to retain the balance, the stronger the force dragging one towards theconclusion which only confirms the actual situation -- there is nothing\thi{outside}, only emptiness, void. As Dostoevsky observed, if there is no God, then everything isallowed.\ftnt{\citef{[I]f you have no God what is the meaning of    crime?}{Karam}{II:Bk.VI:Ch.3 [Father Zossima]} \citef{[S]ince there is    anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god,    even if he is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his new    position, he may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old    morality of the old slaveman, if necessary.}{Karam}{IV:Bk.XI:Ch.9 [Ivan's    Nightmare]}}%The lived emptiness breeds nihilism all the way down -- nihilism, that is, thelack of any criteria, the total \thi{freedom}, \thi{freedom from\ldots} or, whatamounts here to the same, meaninglessness (for since everymeaning carries with it a \thi{threat} of external authority, total \thi{freedom  from\ldots} can appear only as arbitrariness.) And the more devastating consequencesit has in the lower, eventually even \co{visible} sphere, the greater the chancefor the conclusion that, actually, there is nothing and that one should drawsome consequences of this \thi{fact}.  It is impossible to exit for there isonly emptiness \thi{outside}; so \co{I} must obviously stay here, in themiddle of this emptiness, but \co{I} can, for that matter, \co{act} -- true,towards things and situations which became immersed in emptiness, which lost alltheir significance and importance, but which still offer all the \co{visible}material for \co{action}. \pa\wo{Naught} can mean both \thi{nothing} and \thi{evil} (as in \wo{naughty}).Tradition associating evil with negativity utilised also the distinction betweenmere lack, privation, and  negation. The former, {privation} could be read asnegation of something particular, of an individual thing, of this or that, andthen negativity would correspond to a total emptiness, negation ofBeing as such. We have changed slightly the sense of \co{privation}, but retained\co{negativity} more or less in this form.In either case, it was difficult to see any positive activity in evil, since itwas merely an ontological lack, a pure non-being. It was a non-substantialnegation, incapable of any action emptiness.  \citet{For evil is the absence of  the good [...]  But only good can be a cause [...]}%because nothing can be a cause except inasmuch as it is a being, and every%being, as such, is good.}{SumTh}{I:q49.a1}Eventually, we will perhaps follow this tradition but we should not, for thisreason, forget the active character of evil.  Emptiness is not necessarilyphysical annihilation and destruction, but \co{alienation}, the spiritualemptiness of heavens, \co{nothingness} which became void.  The \No\ which,declaring this ultimate emptiness, sells its soul, expects some\co{visible} cash in exchange.  Evil has a tendency -- not tosay, power -- to grow and spread. It does not help calling it \wo{negation},\wo{lack} or \wo{emptiness}, because these may seem empty and inactive only whentaken abstractly. But evil acts {\em in} human soul, consumes and corrodes it.Although this corrosion may be viewed as a gradual negation, in fact it is adeterioration and increasing \co{alienation}. The fact that the final result isnegative emptiness, does not mean that the process which led to it was equallyempty and non-existent.  Evil becomes \co{active} when itreaches the \sch\ of \No, when it declares that there is nothing \thi{outside},and when having thus annihilated the sphere of \co{invisible}, it turns to whatis left -- \co{acting} in the \co{visible world} to compensate for, or else torevenge, the \co{invisible} loss \co{above}.  This evil is not only capable ofaction, but could be almost defined by it, as opposed to the two kinds we haveconsidered before.  \wo{Evil, be thou my good: by thee at least\lin Divided empire  with heaven's king I hold}$^{\ref{ftnt:evilBeGood}}$ -- these are words of a resolute (even if defeatedand resigned) being determined for action.  This is resoluteness of the ultimateresignation.%{IV:110-111}Accepting the defeat and impossibility of reconquering paradise, it turns awayfrom the emptiness and directs its activity to all, and only, \co{visible  world}.  \la{Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto.}\ftnt{\citef{I am    Satan, and deem nothing human alien to me.}{Karam}{IV:Bk.XI:Ch.9 [Ivan's    Nightmare]}\label{ftnt:satanSum}} \co{Active evil}, the evil of \co{active} \No, apparentlyleaves the passivity of negation (to which it was merely exposed) and decides to\co{act}, to take its damned fate into its own hands, and turn it into whateverit chooses, that is, into whatever it is able to. For \woo{to be weak is  miserable}{Milton, I:157} while \citet{To reign is worth ambition, though in  hell:\lin Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.}{Milton}{I:157; 262-3}\pa This decision is not, at least not primarily, any\co{actual} decision. It is of the same order as the \co{spiritual choice}, an\co{invisible} event which starts plaguing the \co{soul}. \co{Actual} decisions,like all the psychology of evil, are only \co{reflections} of the \co{invisible}\No\ which, in turn, is  \co{thirst} culminated in the resigned defeat.Now, there is no question about the {\em psychological} possibility of beingmotivated and attracted by some evil. Such a possibility may be inexplicable forthe psychology identifying the \thi{good} with the \thi{desired}, but it certainly obtains. \co{I} can beattracted to some evil not only because \wo{there is a certain  show of beauty in sin}, but also because \co{I} desire it for its evil's own sake. Augustine recollects: \citet{The malice  of the act was base and I loved it -- that is to say I loved my own undoing, Iloved the evil in me -- not the thing for which I did the evil, simply theevil.}{AugustConf}{II:4 [More recently, similar point is made for instance in\citeauthor*{EvilOwn}.]} %But the essay is only what it announces to be: a bit of psychology.

But if evil happens to be nobody's fault,it only means that {\em everybody} is guilty. In case of \wo{sick} people, likede Sade, there should be little doubt. Sickness is not necessarily evil nor isit necessarily making one evil -- but as every pain and suffering it can do both. (Pain, sickness, deformity, as natural associates of evil are consistently symbolised by all hunchbacks, deformed sorcerers andugly witches in fairy tales.)  However, if one acts evil, it does not mattermuch whether it is because of some experienced pain, sickness, unhappychildhood, or whatever. As there are no sufficient reasons, no amount ofnegative experience ever justifies evil. Usually, it functions only as a betteror worse excuse.Actual evil is evil, whether the person causing it had happy or unhappychildhood, whether he is healthy or sick, whether he suffered much or not. Evilis the impossibility of justification, therefore it always looksfor excuses. Let us follow de Sade a little bit more. \pa \citet{Certain souls seem hard because they are capable of strong feelings,  and they sometimes go to rather extreme lengths; their apparent unconcern and  cruelty are but ways, known only to themselves, of feeling more strongly than  others.}{Sade}{Last Will and Testament} Strength and intensity of feelings,  feelings which one experiences and not manufactures oneself, work as a sufficient excuse for deSade, in fact, as the highest good itself.  Following such impulses is only tofollow the nature.  \citet{We are no guiltier in following the primitive  impulses that govern us than is the Nile for her floods or the sea for her  waves.}{Sade}{Aline and Valcour\label{cit:Nile}}Felt intensity is always concentrated, narrowed to the ultimately \co{actual},\co{immediate}. One searches for moments, moments of sensation which could fillone with the stimulating experience. These, at least, seem to offer somethingcapable to overcome the emptiness, to leave it behind at the negative stage.Stavrogin still complains \citet{Here I liked to live least. But even here I was  unable to hate anything. [...] I may desire to make a good act and it causes  me pleasure. But just in a moment I desire an evil one and feel equal  pleasure. Both this and that feeling is as always too flat, and I never desire  strongly.}{Devils}{III:8.Epilogue} De Sade has his answer: \citet{True  felicity lies only in the senses, and virtue gratifies none of  them.}{Sade}{Aline and Valcour} It is the intensity of a momentaneoussensation which appears as the most gratifying, the most true element of experience.%to which one dedicates the whole attention.And the highest intensity can be found in pain.  \citet{[W]e are much more  keenly affected by pain than by pleasure: reverberations which result in us  when the sensation of pain is produced in others will essentially be of a more  vigorous character, more incisive, will more energetically resound in us [...]  hence pain must be preferred, for pain's telling effects cannot deceive, and  its vibrations are more powerful.}{SadeBed}{Dialogue the Third.   (Masochism might be  here considered only a variation on the same theme as sadism.\thi{Morally}, perhaps, more acceptable than the latter, it expresses the same  desperate yearning for irrefutable \co{immediacy} of \thi{truth}, pain or  pleasure, the same deterioration of the \co{soul}.

Typically, they have a strongly sociological flavour -- the  individual being alienated from the society, usually, due to dysfunctional  social mechanisms. Ignoring the fact  that even such an alienation is but an individual experience and thus,  ultimately, an alienation from the \co{self}, and looking for reasons and  excuses in the (often deplorable) social surroundings, they differ completely  from our notion in that they hardly address an individual but a social process  and hence, at most, a schematic exemplar of a member of a species or, as in  the historically most successful variant, of a social class.% Let us only notice one (without, of course, subscribing to the associated theory% of alienation).% Accusing the industrial towns for the most shameless immorality in the oppression% of proletariat, Engels recognises there the same signs of evil: people% \citef{crowded by one another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to%   do with one another, and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep%   to his own side of the pavement, so as not to delay the opposing streams of%   the crowd, while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a%   glance. The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his%   private interest, [the] dissolution of mankind into monads, of which each one%   has a separate essence, and a separate purpose, the world of atoms, is here%   carried out to its utmost extreme.}{EngelsCond}{IV.The great towns}.Sociological observations underlie also a more recent version which, however,does not quite manage to hide its personal background.

Havingturned away from the \co{invisible}, there is only one possibility: to embraceand conquer the \co{visible}. \citet{What is remote is no longer important, only  yesterday; and tomorrow is more than eternity.}{LouR}{Rilke's letter from  Oberneuland-bei-Bremen, July 25, 1903, p.44} But without the continuity withthe \co{origin}, \co{this world} shrinks and begins to disappear, becomes firstmere \co{actuality}, \co{more actuality}, even \co{more}, until it reaches thelimits of \co{immediacy}, and threatens with disappearance in emptiness.  Amoment devoid of the element of eternity becomes a desperate expectation of thenext moment.  Intensity is, we could say, a noetic counterpart of such anoematum \thi{moment}.  Intensity tries to dissolve in this noematic correlate,and failing -- tries again.  (Thirst for strong, intense feelings is a form ofnihilism, too, even if it affects mostly adolescent girls and disappointedwomen. It is, however, also an expression of the very common reduction of thevalues of human being to \co{subjectivity} -- feelings, personal\co{experiences}, private choices\ldots)The intensity searched for is also the impulsivity emanated, and as the momentsbecome more and more intense, they also fall apart, each becomes its ownuniverse of intensity collapsing inward, and giving rise to an impulse arisingfrom nowhere.  Acting from an impulse has often been associated not only withunreasonable lack of control but with evil -- evil which surprises, isunpredictable, emerges suddenly. The word \wo{impulse} carries the meaning of\thi{application of sudden force} but also, even if only secondarily, of a\thi{suggestion coming from an evil spirit}. For \citet{evil is  unstable}{DivNames}{IV:23.\kilde{p.121} \citef{We shall be reminded that the    Vicious Soul is unstable, swept along from every ill to every other, quickly    stirred by appetites, headlong to anger, as hasty to compromises, yielding    at once to obscure imaginations, as weak, in fact, as the weakest thing made    by man or nature, blown about by every breeze, burned away by every    heat.}{Plotinus}{I:8.11}} or, as Kierkegaard says, \wo{the demoniac is the  sudden}. Demons wake up not when reason is asleep but when it has nothinghigher to strive for, when it loses itself in the insatiability of \co{more} and\co{more} -- \co{precise}, momentaneous, intense, ecstatic\ldots\pa \co{Active evil} is the most personal -- in the sense,\thi{individualised} -- form of evil. This \thi{individualisation}, however, hasnothing to do with the uniqueness of individual \co{existence}, only with thetransgressive and \co{alienating} \co{actuality} of its \co{acts} and \co{activities}. It\thi{individualises} by losing all individuality, it grants \co{actual}moments, \co{visible} sand corns in exchange for the \co{invisible} reality and\co{origin} of its sense. It \thi{individualises} by erasing the person of itscarrier -- a sinner becomes eventually nothing but a {substantialisation} of evil,the place where its negativity unfolds its active \co{presence}. This \thi{individualisation} through \co{actual} choices, distractions andintensity, apparently filling and overfilling every moment, is only an\co{inverted} form of the underlying emptiness and, at the bottom, only a  perverted form of the genuine \co{existential} possibility. Consciousness, as before, has little to do with any significant aspects.  Onehardly ever says \co{reflectively} and explicitly \wo{Evil, be thou my good}.At most, one can \co{actually} repeat this after it has been said in the depthof one's soul; after long time, when most of the consequences became\co{visible} and one finds it impossible not to accept them. Here, as elsewhere,the \co{actual subject}, the \co{reflective} consciousness becomes affected bythe \co{invisible}. It loses all meaning of its contents, and then also all thecontents, except, perhaps, for the most \co{visible} elements of naturalnecessities. Eventually, consciousness, too, dissolves in the emptiness whichhas eroded the whole being.  \co{Active evil} does not any longer try toescape this unfortunate, undeserved, unjust fate -- living this inability itonly seeks to avenge itself and through revenge \co{alienates} itself only moreand more.\subsection{Impersonally personal}% As all schemata, also the three levels of evil give only an approximation; one% can always refine typologies and multiply distinctions.  We wanted only to% indicate what seems to be the central aspects of the \co{nexus} of evil.Let us gather these levels of gradual growth of evil in some common points. \wtsep{original sin}\pa\label{pa:originalSinII}We said \wo{believing in something}, \wo{believing in nothing}. Suchformulations  did not concern, at least not necessarily, any\co{actual}, reflectively pronounced beliefs. As usual, with respect to the\co{invisible origins}, the \co{reflective}consciousness does not matter much -- it only registers by \co{dissociating},\co{reflects} something which is there already.Evil is never willed for its own sake; even if extreme suffering perverts one'ssoul to the point of accepting evil, it is still only a helpless reaction, or asthe case may be, hope that at least {\em this} will be some good.It arrives unwilled, from unregistered and unrecognised meanings of one's actsand words, from \thi{misunderstandings} which prove hurtful, from depersonalisedrigidity of humans turned clerks, from impersonal heights of socio-politicalsystem, from God knows where\ldots It is born between men (sometimes between manand \thi{natural evils}), but it is born {\em into} them and once born, it cangrow. An individual may attempt, and often even succeed, to check his evil predispositions, but he is neverguaranteed that evil emptiness won't ever affect him. On a larger, social scale,emergence of evil is simply unavoidable, and the only thing we can try to do isto moderate its strength and scope. The unintentionality of evil, underlyingthese unpleasant observations, was termed the \wo{original  sin}.\ftnt{\thi{Original sin} is not meant to {\em explain} the appearance of  unintended evil (we do not explain anything) -- it is only a term of description.}\wtsep{only human}\pa The unintentional and impersonal (as one also might say, generational andcollective rather than individual) character of the original sin does not in anyway abolish human participation in it. \thi{Killing the subject}, dispensingwith it (in the name of impersonal forces of power, capital, social mechanisms or inwhatever name one chooses), does not make any amends, does not improveunderstanding of evil -- it only apparently relieves the participants from thesense of guilt and responsibility.Evil is an event of human life and without humans there would be no evil. Wehave ignored all kinds of \thi{natural evils}, usually distinguished from\thi{moral evil}.  We are probably not justified in ignoring such an importantaspect. But it does not appear as any problem, nor even a relevant point, to ourconsiderations. Many things happen due to natural processes, and some of themhave more or less devastating consequences for some humans. We would not onlydistinguish it as \thi{natural evil}, but would not call it \wo{evil} at all.For evil calls for a justification (which is impossible), while a storm or anearthquake do not -- \citet{catastrophes are innocent.}{HerbertAnts}{Cleomedes}It is either the infantile idea of some omnipotent Being with good will and\co{actual} intentions, or else some idea of ultimate {objectified} meaning,eventual \gre{telos}, which might suggest one to look for any \thi{explanation}of this platitude.  Natural disasters, like diseases, call for strength to putup with them when nothing can be done, and for inventiveness in preventing them.Calling them \wo{evil} is like getting offended on the world for not pleasingus.Evil is maintained only in humans, it requires a human, though this might appearas a mere consequence of its understanding as \co{alienation} from the\co{origin}.  As this is, in principle, possible for every \co{existence}, wecould probably suggest that it constitutes the \la{differentia specifica} of thehuman species: \thi{to be capable of evil}.  There is a strong tendency to see,eventually, only innocence in all the cruelty of the living nature; a predator,an animal killer is not evil -- how could it be?! -- it is a survivor. It isimpossible, or in any case naive, to transfer any such observations to the worldof humans.\wtsep{yet, impersonal, invading}\pa\label{evilimpersonal}\label{evillonely} Although we do not place evil innature but only in humans, it does not mean that it becomes human. It remainsimpersonal, because human being is only a tool of evil. It invades one, often withoutmuch warning, without giving any account. The \co{subject}, \co{I myself} amaffected by something which has found place \co{above me}, in \co{my self}. Andbecause this force which found its site there is adversary -- which isexperienced as various degrees of \co{alienation} -- it is foreign.  Whether anevil social or political system, whether Woland who never argues but onlycommands, or else Mephistopheles who appears {in person} to discuss with Faust,the force which is brought forth is not \co{mine}, does not belong to \co{me}nor, for that matter, to \co{my self}.  It is impersonal, because its strengthdoes not flow from the \co{original} site of personality but, on the contrary,prevents \co{me} from regaining this site. It \thi{individualises} by breakingcontinuity, by \co{dissociating} heaven from earth and thus \co{alienating} andisolating.  Loneliness, like foreignness, is an \co{actual} image of\co{alienation} which follows evil even in the midst of the thickest crowd. Thisloneliness is \co{alienation} from the \co{origin}, the loss of the personalcenter, and thus the opposite of the unique individuality of \co{existence}.Participation in evil, submission to this impersonal force, amounts indeed to\thi{selling one's \co{soul}}.If we were to personify such events, we would ascribe evil the {\em intention}of becoming \co{visible} (its surrogate for \co{concreteness}), which itachieves by invading a human soul and, through it, overcoming its own impersonalabstractness. A person of active \No, but also a sinner who approaches thedeeper layers of emptiness, is a {substantialisation} of evil; a{substantialisation} which proceeds gradually, as the emptiness embraces thesoul and finds its \co{visible} expressions, but which never becomes complete,which never reaches the goal. For the goal would be, as it always is, to reachthe very center of Being, to achieve the ultimate justification by meetingthe \co{origin} -- this, however, is the exact opposite of evil.  Evil, althoughoriginating in \co{this world}, begins without being noticed, and thenpenetrates the soul to its deep, \co{invisible} roots. However, its ultimate,\co{invisible} site is not in the center of Being, in the \co{origin}. For it isexactly \co{alienation} from the \co{origin}, \co{alienation} of \co{myself}from \co{self}, which is evil.%So, it can only stay a step \co{below}, maintaining its destructive activityThus, \citet{evil always lessens good, yet it never wholly consumes it; and thus,  while good ever remains, nothing can be wholly and perfectly bad. Therefore,  the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 5) that "if the wholly evil could be, it  would destroy itself"; because all good being destroyed (which it need be for  something to be wholly evil), evil itself would be taken away since its  subject is good.}{SumTh}{I:q49.a3}\wtsep{impossibility of justification}\pa\label{pa:noJustification} The impossibility of reaching the \co{absolute},the lack of \co{concrete founding} in the \co{origin} is\co{alienation}.\ftnt{We are not, of course, speaking about any \co{actual}  grasp on the \co{absolute} which is missing.

We will return to this aspect.}  Allow us to call\noo{(for the  reasons to be clarified later)} such a continuity of Being, the \co{concrete  founding} in the \co{origin}, \wo{\co{justification}}.

Soul infected by evilkeeps trying to fill the expanding emptiness; it keeps \co{thirsting} for\co{justification}, for \wo{the desire for the bliss, which she had lost,  remained with her even after the Fall.}$^{\ref{ftnt:afterFall}}$\co{Justification}, however, can only come from \co{above}, while evil -- seeing\co{nothing} \co{above} and declaring it to be void -- must produce it itself.All it is capable of producing are arguments supposedly explaining theattitudes it develops and actions it performs; explaining, that is,demonstrating that this is actually right, natural, or even necessary, thing todo.  \wo{We are no guiltier in following the privative impulses that govern us  than is the Nile for her floods or the sea for her waves.}% used earlier {Marquis de Sade, Aline and Valcour}Being the lack of \co{justification}, evil always tries to explain, that is,excuse itself.  A common form of such attempts at self-justification is to point to the actualevils in the world.%In a sense, this corresponds to what we are saying (, but the%difference appears when one starts calling things \wo{evil} and, above all, when%such things serve as justification of one's own evil tendencies.This form may display rare ingenuity in the search for evil, so that eventuallynothing remains which would not appear affected by it.  But a\citeti{good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good  things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil  things.}{Mt. XII:35; Lk.VI:45}{} Using some evil as a justification ofanything is dubious, if not directly dangerous, for a step from there tojustification of more evil is invisibly small.  A rigid moralist defends theworld against all evil which lurks behind people's back, without them noticingit.  As a matter of fact, he only tries to defend himself against hisprogressing \co{alienation}. But finding evil in allcorners of the universe and human soul, this defense only strengthens the adversary; it multiplies evilinstead of diminishing it -- multiplies it at least in the soul which sees iteverywhere and forgets \citeti{that whatsoever thing from without entereth into  the man, it cannot defile him; Because it entereth not into his heart, but  into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?}{Mk.}{VII:18-19} A profound moralist, whether of a revolutionary or pietistic flavour, willoften turn out faultlessly cynical in his \co{actions}, which no longer aim atthe person but only at the evil hiding behind.

But evil acts, for it corrupts good.%   Therefore evil is a being and a nature.}{Aquinas, Summa Theologiae,%   I:q48.a1.obj.4} We will return to the issue of being or non-being of evil in a% later section. For the moment we only want to consider its activity which, we% must admit, seems to us incontestable.Now, the long tradition (going at least back to Origen and Plotinus,even Plato) used to deny being and, consequently, also any activity toevil.\verify{}%\noo{Check, Plotinus, II:9.13 [``Against the Gnostics'']    Once more, we have no right to ask that all men shall be good,or to rush into censure because such universal virtue is not possible:this would be repeating the error of confusing our sphere with theSupreme and treating evil as a nearly negligible failure in wisdom- asgood lessened and dwindling continuously, a continuous fading out; -- anothertranslation: we should treat evil as good lessened...}%St.~Thomas' argument should be both sufficiently representative and detailed: \citt{A thing is said to act in a threefold sense. In one way,formally, as when we say that whiteness makes white; and in that sense evilconsidered even as a privation is said to corrupt good, forasmuch as it isitself a corruption or privation of good. In another sense a thing is said toact effectively, as when a painter makes a wall white. Thirdly, it is said inthe sense of the final cause, as the end is said to effect by moving theefficient cause. But in these two ways evil does not effect anything of itself,that is, as a privation, but by virtue of the good annexed to it. For everyaction comes from some form; and everything which is desired as an end, is aperfection. And therefore, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv): "Evil does not act,nor is it desired, except by virtue of some good joined to it: while of itselfit is nothing definite, and beside the scope of our will and intention."}{Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, I:q48.a1.r-o.4}We have agreed to the last point, namely, that evil is willed only as a good, asa misunderstood good. The second point seems to be left rather uncommented, butit refers probably to the fact that efficient cause must be a being, and as suchit is good (we will return to this point shortly). Formal causality, mentionedfirst, does not seem to worry St.~Thomas as any real activity. Probably rightly, forthere is not much \thi{real causality} in it. These Aristotelean causal schematado not appeal to us any more and, today, we would not consider a subsumption ofan instance under a general concept as any form of causality. But this is allSt.~Thomas is willing to grant evil: it acts (causes)\noo{Let us ignore, that is  accept, the underlying identification of activity with causality.} some evilin the way whiteness makes white.If I murder a man, I may grant myself the consolation of being, at the bottom ofmy heart, good and, moreover, of not willing anything evil by this act. But Icommitted it and the \thi{privation of good} which occurred is not a mereformality of classifying an instance under a general rule -- it was not deathwhich made the man dead, it was me; and it was not any abstract, formalprinciple of evil which {\em committed} this evil act, it was me. So I, a beingultimately \citet{good is the accidental cause of evil.}{SumTh}{I:q49.a3.Obj5}But the very fact that I accidentally cause evil is itself due to some evildevelopment, is due to the fact that I am affected by evil -- not formally, notas a mere principle of classification, but most really. What hides (or at least,can be found) in the sterility of a formal cause, seems often to be the mostreal process of \co{actualisation} of the \co{virtuality}.\ftnt{We have  commented it in Book I, beginning of subsection~\ref{sub:virt},  \refp{pa:foundingCausing}-\refp{pa:contActVirt}.  Otherwise, \thi{whiteness of    a white thing} was dealt with under the discussion of \co{concepts} and  supposed \thi{essences} in II:~\ref{impressConcept}. Its difference from  \thi{evil of an evil act} or, for that matter, anything which proceeds in  \co{existence} from \co{virtuality} towards \co{actuality} should have become  clear from the following sections \ref{sec:levelC}-\ref{sec:levelD} of Book  II.}  Evil in which I participate, which \co{alienates me}, is capable of\co{actually} expanding this \co{alienation} -- both within \co{my soul} and,through \co{my} evil \co{acts}, in the world.

True, it always requires \co{me}to be around, as a tool; all its activity must pass through \co{my actuality};everything it possibly can do, it can do only with \co{my} hands. Yet, it acts,that is, \co{actualises} itself, for after all, \co{I am not the master}.  Itunfolds like a hermeneutical spiral of self-elaboration: from the \co{virtual},impersonal and \co{invisible} seeds, which mature and ripen unnoticed, to theeventual consequences, deterioration, \co{visible} dissolution and emptiness.The uprising of Satan, his fight against the good, finds place in heaven -- theearth only observes the consequences.This emphasis on the active element of evil may be a mere subtlety which doesnot reflect any significant disagreement -- we follow closely the traditionwhich sees evil primarily (though not merely) as negativity. Indeed, we do.  Thereis, however, another aspect of this tradition which is harder to swallow.\wtsep{But, there are evil things, acts, deeds....}\pa \citet{[N]o Thing is contrary to God; no creature nor creature's work, nor  anything that we can name or think is contrary to God or displeasing to Him,  but only disobedience and the disobedient  man.}{TheolGerm}{XVI.\label{ftnt:obedience}   \citef{God is the supreme existence, that is to say, supremely is [...]  Consequently, to that nature which supremely is, and which created all else  that exists, no nature is contrary save that which does not exist.

Even the devils derive  their existence from the Good, and their mere existence is  good.}{DivNames}{IV:34 \noo{p.129}}Common to all these variations on this neo-Platonic theme is the Aristotelianopposition between act and potency which coincides with that between perfectionand imperfection and, eventually, between good and evil. Thus, everything which\co{actually} is must, indeed, be good.  Devils, perhaps, in so far as they\co{exist} are good, too. But what about a torture dungeon? It might have arisen\wo{not through any power but through weakness}, though St.~Thomas would probablystill argue that there is some perfection, actual power, in the mere fact of itsactualisation.  But even in the tradition which sanctified Aquinas, one canstate that \citt{evil is not only a lack of good, but a living and spiritual  being, though one who is deprived and depriving.}{Paul VI, in  \citeauthor*{RatzingerRep} \citaft{SatanMinois}{ p.165}}  The unreserved ontological optimism does notappear plausible. Any thing, say a house, may be bad as this particular thing, it may be a badhouse, but still, in so far as it {\em is}, its very existence, is good. But itdoes not seem possible to argue such a case!  A concentration camp is evil andit is not an evil which merely deprives some substantial good -- the very {\em  fact} of its existence is evil, its very existence is evil. Evil not only\wo{inheres in this thing which has being}, in fact, it constitutes its\thi{being and essence}, for except for being evil, this thing is nothing,without being evil, this thing would no longer be itself. It won't help to claimthat its buildings might have been used for other purposes; it won't help toblame the formal, nor even the material causes for the evil which accidentallyinhabited this essentially good being -- it is evil through and through,including all the involved engineering perfections; it is the more evil, themore such perfections it involves!  The fact that it got \co{actualised} won'thelp anybody to claim that somewhere, at the bottom, it must be good -- it canonly indicate that not only there is no equivalence between, but not even anyimplication from \co{act} to perfection, from \co{actuality} to goodness.  Themere actuality, the mere fact of the existence of Birkenau must be very\wo{contrary to God and displeasing to Him.}\noo{Unless, of course, one is  willing to follow much more intricate meanders of theodicy than we are able  to.  Goodness and all the perfections actualised in the design and  construction of Birkenau might, perhaps, appeal to the Scholastic pedantry,  but no sane person would ever appreciate that. The very efficiency of a  concentration camp makes it the more evil.}\pa That \woo{every being, as such, is good}{Aquinas, Summa Theologiae,  I:q48:a1}, that \citet{[t]hings solely good [...] can in some circumstances  exist; things solely evil, never, for even those natures which are vitiated by  an evil will, so far as they are vitiated, are evil, but in so far as they are  natures are good,}{CityGod}{XII:3} that every \co{actualisation} as opposed toa mere possibility is good -- this other side of the face which sees evil as amere negation, which \woo{by the name of evil [signifies] the absence of  good}{Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, I:q48:a1} -- can not, possibly, stayunmodified.~\ftnt{\label{evilAlways}And this not because something particular  happened with Auschwitz, Stalin's collectivisation or Khmer Rouge regime which  would require re-evaluation of anything. The only special thing about these examples  is their recentness. If any comparisons were allowed, one would have to  admit that the fate of native Americans witnesses to evil much more powerful,  long lasting and, eventually, more successful and hence more terrifying than  the relatively brief, even if horrifying, excesses of Nazism.  (The fact that  it has been perpetuated by the countries which, at present, possess enough  power even to adjust the official definitions of the terms like \wo{genocide}  in order to exclude their own case, is at most of only political relevance.  [\citeauthor*{Genocide}]) Many peoples disappeared not due to some processes  which we might find excusable and understandable in historical terms, but as a  consequence of intentional policies applying the most advanced technologies of  the time for systematic extermination of other peoples. On the other hand, it  does {\em not matter at all} if the intentions were mere suppression and  subordination -- in many cases it was more than that. What counts is the evil  of the final effect -- extermination -- which is approximately as old as the  recorded history.  Describing his expedition against Damascus, the Assyrian  king Shalmaneser II records various skirmishes: \wo{I desolated and destroyed,    I burnt it: 1200 chariots, 1200 horsemen, 20.000 men of Biridri of Damascus;    700 chariots, 700 horsemen, 10.000 men of Irhulini of Hamath; 2.000    chariots, 10.000 men of Ahab of Israel [...]}  The expedition found place in  854\bc, and similar boastings can be found on clay tablets and in chronicles  ever since.  That numbers are probably exaggerated does not change the fact  that the mood and intentions are not. If one wanted to maintain that  extermination in battles is not simply extermination (which, unfortunately, it  still is), so let us observe that people were also more systematic than that.  Assyrians of the Second Empire (after Tiglath-pileser III, 745-727\bc) are the  recorded inventors of mass deportations of peoples with the object of breaking  down their national spirit, unity and independence. Thus ended the existence  of Hittites, whose wealth and trade passed into the hands of the Assyrian  colonists after the fall of the capitol Carchemish in 717\bc\ Assyrians  themselves disappeared from the history after the fall and demolishion of  their capitol Nineveh in 606\bc\ Romans were certainly not exterminators yet,  was it merely their systematic warfare which left only residual rests after  Celts who once populated most of Europe?  Systematic neighbours left no traces  after the \thi{christianisation} of Jatwingians, Prussians (the original  Baltic people, not the Teutonic Knights and German settlers who claimed their  place and name), Slavic tribes like Polabians, Abotrites, Liutizians, etc.,  etc., etc.}Speaking abstractly, evil is a negation, but negation of what?  For certainly,negation is not evil, that is, it is not always evil.In our setting it is negation of the \co{origin}, negation which turns\co{nothingness} into emptiness, which thus berefts the \co{existence} of itsfundamental character of \co{confrontation}, negation which\co{alienates} \co{myself} from the \co{self}, and then, from others and all the world. In the derivative sense, everything which leads to and strengthens \co{alienation} is evil, too.As the \co{confrontation} with the \co{origin} is \co{existence}, we mayconsider it as such, as \co{existence} \la{simpliciter}, to be good.% Origen, Commentary to The Gospel of John, II:7 &% II:9.2: \la{certum namque est malum esse bono carere}: zlo to brak dobraNow, as St.~Thomas says, \citet{by the name of evil is signified the absence of  good.  And this is what is meant by saying that "evil is neither a being nor a  good."  For since being, as such, is good, the absence of one implies the  absence of the other.}{SumTh}{I:q48:a1} Besides the unclear use ofimplications\ftnt{Every \wo{is} in this quotation is probably meant as and  equivalence. Thus, first \wo{being = good}, and then not only \wo{evil is a    non-being, is a lack of being}, but also \wo{any lack of being is evil} -- a  disputable matter, to put it mildly.}, this is a bit too abstract for us.  Wesay that \co{existence}, as such, is good, but we would not say that, for thisreason, its negation, namely non-\co{existence}, is evil. Not because it must bewrong but only because we do not know what that possibly could mean. What is\wo{non-existence}?  Is it the total lack of any \co{existence} whatsoever, thetotal lack of life? We might, perhaps, feel that things are better with lifethan without and agree that extermination of life would be evil. But if life hadnever appeared? It is hard to judge contrafactuals, especially ones withconditions excluding the very possibility of judgment. But it is also hard toimagine what inherent evil would be in the total \co{indistinctness}.  So, wouldnon-existence be the non-existence of Pegasus? Of a person we could imagine toexist? Of my grandfather (that is, the fact that he is not alive any longer)?Perhaps (but only a huge perhaps!), it might be OK if some of these now\co{existed}. But even then, this would not force us to see anything evil intheir \co{actual} non-existence. Unless, that is, one wanted to see naturaldeath itself as some evil, which would be to protest against the very character and  nature of \co{existence}, that is, to restrain \co{existing} itself.\pa\label{alienX} Evil is \co{alienation} -- it is that which inhibits\co{existence} in \co{existing}, which breaks the continuity between\co{actuality} and its \co{origin} and thus prevents their \co{confrontation}.But this inhibiting, this preventing is not the same as the flat negation:non-\co{existence}, lack of \co{existence}. \co{Alienation} amounts, so tospeak, to closing off \co{existence} within some horizon, putting an artificial-- because \co{non-actual}! -- limit to its otherwise \co{open} unfoldingtowards its \co{origin}. It is a special kind of negation, a special form of it,and this specificity suggests to the language the word \wo{evil}, in addition tothe mere \wo{negation}.  An aspect of this specificity is that it is primarilyconcerned with \co{existence} and not merely (that is, generally) with allbeing.  Evil is the event of human life, it is only in humans that evil can finda site for its unfolding, and it is primarily humans that it affects.\citet{Indeed, our vices or sins, which are what are properly to be called  evils, are unable to exist except in souls -- that is, in good  creatures.}{AbelardPJC}{II:\para 401} One can hardly be evil towards dead things; one'sdestructive tendencies towards them may, at most, indicate some evil processesgoing on in one's \co{soul}, but these are only \co{signs}. One can be evil towardsliving organisms (which fall under our generous definition of \co{existence}),though here, too, the judgment will often see the \co{signs} of potentiallygreater evil: what seems most appalling in the image of a person molesting oreven torturing an animal is not only the pain he causes but the question\wo{What must be going on in him? What a rotten person he must be!}  Eventually,evil affects only human being, \woo{yet it never consumes it.}{Aquinas repeated,  ST, I:q49.a3} Things solely evil cannot exist in so far as evil is the accident ofhuman \co{existences}. These -- {\em and only these} -- are, inso far as they \co{exist}, good.\noo{The neo-Platonic elements of ontological  optimism in Augustine's theory of evil are mitigated by its moral character:  good is related to God and, secondarily, to human being, while evil centers  exclusively around human -- because voluntary and wilful -- defiance, around  the misdirected love whereby the will fell away from the immutable to the  mutable good.}%Title of Bk.XII:Ch.B in The City of God% {In On Evil, q2.art.1, Aquinas says the ontological optimism with respect to every% being gets a similar flavor: \wo{the subject itself is called good inasmuch as%   it is in potentiality to perfection, for example the soul to virtue, and the%   substance of the eye to acuteness of sight.}{[The Many Faces of Evil, p.86]}}In the derivative (and this does not mean {metaphorical} nor {weaker})%only relative)sense, things can be evil to the extent they serve evil.  But unlike\co{existence}, things (and also \co{acts}) can be wholly and totally evil.That \wo{evil always lessens good, yet it never wholly consumes it} applies tothe \co{existence} which is affected by evil but is nevertotally underlied it. For evil is but the privation of\co{existence}, the \co{alienation} from the \co{origin}, which indeed is nevercomplete. Things, on the other hand, orgenerally anything \co{actualised}, when \co{dissociated} and locked within the \hoa, can become dead \co{signs}, epitomes of mere evil and nothingmore.  The problem with \thi{things} like concentration camps is that even aslightest attempt to look for anything good in them is inappropriate, if notdirectly detestable. They not only served evil purposes (while, perhaps, theycould have served others) -- their mere being is purely evil, as they epitomisenothing but the strength and depth of evil which was consuming the humans whoinvented and utilised them. They are thoroughly evil because they have no\co{rest} \co{above} the pure evil of their purpose, and of the \co{precision}in its execution -- they are \co{actualisation} of nothing but evil. \citt{[A]  corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

We can,nevertheless, discern the powerful \co{existential} call in the claim that  existence of everything, even of evils, is good. It translates into a call to \co{openness}, \co{humble} acceptance of every particular as something, at its bottom, if not at its surface, good. In so far as this aspect is concerned, we are in full agreement. Also, such a \co{concretely founded}% (section~\ref{sec:schYes}, in particular, \ref{sub:concrete}) acceptance does in fact lend all the things the element of goodness, of \co{participation} in the \co{origin}. But such a goodness does not apply universally and unreservedly; it is not any fact of mere ontology which one can discern in the matter of the objective world if only one analyses things thoroughly enough -- it, just as its opposite, is an \co{existential} possibility.% in footnote~\ref{evilAlways}% \citet{Woe unto the world because of offenses! for it must needs be that % offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh!}{Matt}{XVIII:7}\noo{ Force?\tsep{is it a force?}\pa \wo{Every \co{existence}, as such, is good.} And it has all the rest of its\co{concreteness}, all the hierarchy including the celestial one and down to themost \co{actual} and physical details of its body.

Only things, \co{acts}, \co{activities} maybe evil -- \co{existence} as such, as \co{confrontation} with the \co{origin},is good.  So evil appears only in \co{this world}. But as a \thi{force} it isnot \co{visible} -- it grows and matures \co{invisibly}; only its consequencesare observed. So is it \co{visible} or not?  Then, it requires a person, but itis not personal.  Is it some \thi{metaphysical principle}, some kind of animpersonal \thi{force}?  A fateful, devilish power, from which there is noescape?  A \thi{substance}?\pa The ontology of the flat opposition \thi{being} vs. \thi{non-being},\thi{real} vs. \thi{unreal}, centering around the notion of \co{actual}\thi{substance}, seems too narrow to accommodate the active reality of evil.If evil be granted a \thi{substantial being}, it threatens the wholemetaphysics with Manicheandualism, If, on the other hand, it is denied such a \thi{being}, it becomes a\thi{non-being}, pure nothingness; and this suffers in theface of the question: Is evil real? Does it really exist? For, of course, itdoes -- everything which is, that is, which is \co{distinguished}, is real.%Calling it a \wo{force} may alleviate the problem a bit but, eventually, this%too tends towards substantialisation of evilConsequently, one seems to be forced either to accept the ontological optimismor else to dissociate good and evil from ontology andto delegate their whole issue to another sphere-- ethics, axiology, agatology\ldots%Levinas claimed ethics to be the first philosophy, but it \pa The same word \wo{evil} can be used both as a noun and an adjective -- wewould be satisfied only with the latter.

In this sense (and with all the necessarytranslations) we do say that \co{existence}, \wo{good is the accidental cause of  evil}.%as only \co{existence} may misunderstand its \co{thirst}.Using the language of \thi{substances} we could say that evil is a property,namely, the property of effecting \co{alienation}. Because of this purelyfunctional definition, no final list of evils (nor goods) will ever be possible.Even if some \co{acts} tend almost always to be evil (killing, lying,humiliating, etc.), and some things are nothing but evil, so yet every\co{existence} may bring in new forms of evil (as well as good) into the world,and may become \co{alienated} by things which never \co{alienated} any previous\co{existence}.  The imperceptible connections between things, the unintendedside-effects of words and \co{acts}, involuntary associations -- all may sow\co{invisible} seeds of evil, due to the specificity of the context, particularsensitivity of the involved persons.  Evil can be a thing, an \co{act}, an\co{activity}, a \co{motive}, a character of a person, a disposition\ldotsYet, this \thi{being a property} is not, in our setting, necessarily being aproperty of something.  The distinction between \thi{substances} and\thi{accidents} is relative -- a \thi{thing}, a \thi{substance} is only a limitof \co{distinctions}. Evil is one of such \co{distinctions} -- as real and aseffective as any other could be. Therefore a particular thing can be thoroughly,unreservedly evil.  With respect to \co{existence}, however, evil may appearonly as an accidental  property.  For evil is not the highest principle butexactly that which breaks%\co{existence} from establishing or maintainingthe continuity withwhat could be called such a principle.  It is that which breaks the continuitywith the \co{origin} and thus inhibits \co{participation} in it. It is anobstacle, an inhibition (\wo{Satan} derives from the Hebrew root \gre{stn} whichmeans adversary, just like the Greek \gre{diabolos}), but thesenegative characterisations must not make us think of it as a mere negation, forit actually spreads and is experienced as an active force.As we have emphasized, it may spread in spite of the best wishes and intentionsof all involved persons, it may begin to consume one's \co{soul} long beforethis becomes \co{visible} to one.  It is just a way in which things, otherpeople, surroundings, and eventually even the involved person himself, can acton and -- voluntarily or not, consciously or not -- influence \co{existence}.Some factors or their constellations have \co{alienating} effect on a person;others do not.  Evil's primary activities are \co{invisible}, and only sometimesthe closest friendship or deep wisdom may \co{recognise} its initial workings.  Eventually, it is only through their effects that they become\co{actually visible}. \citt{Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.}{Mt.  VII:18-20}% This, not any utilitarian felicity calculus% of \co{visible} consequences, seems to us to lie in the metaphor: \citt{A good%   tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth%   good fruit.

Talking about \wo{highest principle}, we  do not mean anything which need be consciously present to somebody.

The progressing process of dissolution, dissociation,\co{alienation} -- this, one might say, is to suggest evil's highest principle!OK, this is the ground for \co{distinguishing} it.But this does not provide any principle, any truth in which evil, as such,\co{participates}; it only announces its lack. Evil has no ultimate \thi{highest  principle}, no master, for it is exactly the lack thereof; it does not\co{participate}, for it is exactly negation of all \co{participation}.  \co{I}can participate in evil because evil is, usually, \thi{greater than me}.

The centerof \co{existence}, the \co{confrontation} with the \co{origin} is not only thegood in itself, but is also the true beginning from which proceed all the\co{distinctions}. In this sense, we may agree on the last sentence: every\co{existence}, as such, is good and nothing can be the beginning (rather than acause) except inasmuch as it is an \co{existence}. Evil is any form of \co{alienation} which breaks the continuity with the\co{origin} -- it is the absence of good. The \wo{cause drawing a thing out of  its proper disposition}, which St.~Thomas insists must be good, is in our language\co{thirst} which gets misunderstood -- for it \co{thirsts} for the \co{absolute  nothing}, but one tries to quench it with the relative, with \co{idols}. Andso, indeed, a conglomeration of good causes may sum up to an evil effect} % end \noo gone to...} % end \noo Force?\subsection{Attachment}\pa Despair and evil are basic forms of \co{alienation}, of broken continuity of\co{traces} which no longer lead to the \co{origin} but stop short ofit. \co{Alienation} results from denying the originarity of the \co{origin}, from the fundamental %\co{spiritual} event, the\co{spiritual choice} of \No\ in which {Psyche}, following the doubts sown bythe oracle and her wealthy sisters, not only prepares to kill but actuallysucceeds in killing her heavenly husband, {Eros}, whom she has never seen.The \co{choice} is \co{spiritual} because, for the first, it is not made by\co{me} -- it is made \co{above me}, but also {\em for} \co{me}, so that \co{I}carry all the consequences, as well as full responsibility, for it. There is,indeed, nobody to blame, and looking forexcuses %(in the childhood, family, society, ...)leads nowhere -- psychology may know about various sufferings of the soul,but it knows nothing about damnation. For the second, the \co{spiritual}character amounts to the \co{absolute} objectlessness of the \co{choice}. It isnot directed towards anything whatsoever, whether \co{visible} or \co{invisible}-- it is lifted \co{above} all \co{distinctions} and directed towards\co{nothing}.  \No\ turns this \co{nothingness} into mere emptiness, total void, lack. It says: \wo{there is no exit, because  \thi{outside} there is only void}, \wo{there is nothing in \co{nothingness}},or perhaps, \wo{\la{nihil ex nihilo}}.%but with a much less epicureanism and much more dramaturgy than the Lucretian original. This refusal, the denial of the \co{foundation} in the \co{invisible origin} of\co{nothingness} is a \co{nexus} of several denials.\pa\label{pride} Denying the \co{invisibility} of the \co{origin} amounts to theclaim of self-sufficiency.  Things are \co{visible} and there is nothing which,at least in principle, could not be appropriated, embraced by the \co{actual}look, grasped by the \co{actual} power of our faculties. It is \co{I} who decideand control, \co{my life} is entirely the matter of my choices. The exclusivedirectedness towards \co{this world} denying \co{that I am not the master} andattempting to reduce everything to the\co{visible} and controllable can be called \wo{\co{pride}}.%As the opposite of \co{humility}, we may call it \wo{\co{pride}}.Freedom, in its negative form, is an aspect of \co{pride} in that \No\ turns\co{nothingness} into emptiness and thus does not recognise anything which mightbe \co{above}. It is freedom to arrange the \co{visible world} entirely as\co{I} find it appropriate since, at the bottom, it is just the freedom from anyhigher \co{commands} which might be understood as limitations of \co{my} freewill. The absolute autonomy, the absolute self-government of the \co{I}, theabsolute freedom from \ldots\ is possible only as a reflection of ultimateemptiness.% Unfortunately, \citt{one cannot will into void}{quoted by George Cotkin -- from%   (?) `What the Will Effects?'}, and so eventually \citt{man has to go mad to%   prove that he is free.}{After Dostoevsky}\pa\label{ingratitude} If \co{I} am something, \co{I} am in particular thesource of \co{my} actions and achievements. And certainly, I am, but here thereis more to it -- I am the {\em only} source of all that, and if it is notpersonally \co{me}, then it is \thi{we}, a multitude of \co{Is}. But a multitudeof \co{Is} is no \co{community} -- it is merely a \co{totality} which doesreduce to its components. So it is \co{I} who am the master and there is noreason for any indefinite \co{thankfulness} which, as a matter of fact, wouldactually offend my dignity. Since the \co{visible world} of \co{mine} is allthat is, there is nobody to be \co{thankful} to, and nothing to be \co{thankful}for. On the contrary, there is a lot to be blamed, as whenever some evil makesitself effective. It is always \co{unclear} what actually is to be blamed,whenever one pronounces a \co{general idea} of the inherent evil, or at least,malice of the world. As with most \co{general ideas}, it ends as a merestatement of \thi{the fact} which only reflects a \co{quality} of one'slife. This statement is, too, an \co{aspect} of \No\ -- let us call it \wo{\co{ingratitude}}.% (As all other \co{aspects} of the \co{spiritual choice}, this statement need not% be pronounced explicitly -- it can be lived without ever becoming% \co{reflectively conscious}, without ever being \co{actually} and \co{precisely}% realized.)% Finding numerous examples% of wrongs and evils in \co{the world}, ridiculing, as Voltaire did, the% powerful idea of Leibinz's of the best possible world by pointing to earthquake% in Lisboa and other disasters meeting Panglos and Candide, and citing them as% understandable reasons for lack of gratitude, is all too easy to be admired.% But such an attitude is not the origin but a consequence of the fundamental \No,% perhaps active, most often passive.  To have a word for this aspect, too, let me% call it \wo{\co{ingratitude}}.\pa\label{closed} \co{Nothingness} surrounding everything is a mere void, while\co{this world} is here, that is, \thi{out there}, actually, in a very definite,objective sense. What it is is not easy to say, and the most natural intuitionis that it is all that is \co{visible}, the \co{totality} of all things, facts,people. These facts and things, having at most some causes but no \co{origin},are \co{experienced} as given; the variety of \co{visible distinctions} is found with the unmistakable stamp of being there,being ready-made.\ftnt{Heidegger would say \thi{ready-at-hand}, though he  would all too definitely identify that with technical manipulation. Sartre might  say that they are \thi{in themselves} --   things turned into dead \co{objects}, even others enslaved by the restless  freedom of  \thi{for-itself}. It is this extreme possibility we are intending  here.}This certainly offers an inexhaustible field of possibleinventiveness but, in the \co{spiritual} sense, it is a \co{closed} -- becausedead -- world. Itdoes not invite to unconditional acceptance of whatever one might meet but, onthe contrary, to separating and \co{dissociating} -- things from things, peoplefrom people -- to searching for and selectingonly what is agreeable. Although such a world is potentially open, in the senseunlimited and indefinitely flexible, the very definite givenness of its buildingblocks, the Sartrean \thi{in-itself} of its \thi{hard facts}, marks it by a kindof rigidity and stiffness -- let us call this \co{aspect} of \No\ \wo{\co{closedness}}.\pa\label{pa:notno} \co{Pride}, \co{ingratitude}, \co{closedness} are but\co{aspects}, only a few \co{aspects} of the \co{spiritual} \No.  As thefundamental reduction of the ultimate \co{invisibility} to emptiness, it amountsto {self-centeredness} or -- what is here a synonym -- {world-centredness}.\co{Attachment} is \No\ to the ultimate \co{origin} said through the {\em exclusive} directedness towards \co{this visible world}.%% Negating the \co{invisible}, directs \co{me} % exclusively towards \co{visibility}. Thus, although it results from % an \co{act} at the same level as \yes, the resulting attitude is not % \co{spiritual} to the same extent as the attitude of % \co{love}.\ftnt{I do not want to imply it with the full force, but % one can in fact compare it with the Socratic idea that right % understanding brings right moral attitude. It does not follow here % only because the right understanding {\em is} the right moral % attitude. One only has to be careful with what one puts into % \thi{understanding}. In this context, it has little, if anything, to do with % mental operations, with mere insight, with any merely \co{visible} % categories. In this context, it simply is the right moral attitude, % the living founded in \co{holiness}, which is never something \thi{pure, % instinctive, unreflected}, but always involves understanding and % self-understanding.% }% %%% go to Morality \ldots\No\ does not  necessarily signify hatred, nor evil, nor despair, %which one might think to be the opposite of \co{love}, though it eventually manifests through such forms.  \co{Attachment}, with allits \co{aspects}, is a \co{spiritual} attitude, that is, addresses \co{nothing}(even if it is not directed towards it) and does not imply any unique ways of\co{actual} being and thinking.  It is not necessarily evil nor despair, it isnot necessarily egoism nor egotism, it is not even necessarily selfishness. Itmay involve unselfish \co{acts} and attitudes, but the very fact of their beingunselfish reflects the underlying \co{attachment} to the categories of\co{mineness}.  One may truly attempt to reach beyond \co{oneself}, to establishand live according to some unselfish principles. One may -- and, indeed, oneoften does -- make absolute claims. But this absoluteness inevitably degeneratesinto a mere universality, a crude subsumption of all thinkable instances.\co{Visible world} is what is \co{below me} and \co{I} am \co{my life}, \co{my  life} is \co{my world} and \co{my world} is \co{myself},II:\refppf{pa:worldislife1}.  The two can not be dissociated: attention to\co{myself} happens already within the horizon of \co{visibility}, andpreoccupation with the \co{visible world}, in whatever form, involves\co{myself}.  Narrowing the attention exclusively to \co{this world}, \co{I}narrow it to \co{myself}. Whether \co{I} do it in a selfish or unselfish modemay make a difference to adolescent psychology or sterile ethics, but\co{spiritually} both -- and, first of all, the very opposition itself! --amount to \co{attachment}.The names of manifestations of \co{attachment} are \wo{plenty} and easy toimagine. We therefore only sum them up in saying that \co{attachment} is the pattern of all \co{idolatry}, \co{absolutisation} of the \co{visible  world} which forgets its \co{invisible origin}. \section{Spiritual choice of Yes}\label{sec:schYes}%\input{033yes}\paIn a Sumerian myth (written down around 1750 \bc)  Inanna, the queen ofHeaven and Earth (or else, the goddess of love, fertility of nature and war),\wo{from the Great Above opened her ear to the Great Below}, to the moaning call from her sister Ereshkigal, the goddess of the Underworld.Descending to the Underworld, Inanna is on the way stripped naked of all herclothes by the servant of Ereshkigal. After 3 days in the Underworld, she returnshelped by her dedicated servant and a cunning plan of the god of Wisdom andWater, Enki, which seems to fool moaning Ereshkigal. (In some versions, to leavethe Underworld, \wo{she must provide someone in her place}, and the one isDumuzi, her husband, the Shepherd or the Lord of the Sheepfolds, ensuringfertility and fecundity, who now has to leave the world for the half of every year.)The theme of the descent and the challenge of facing nakedness, isolation,helplessness, recurs frequently  in later Indo-Europeanmythology.  Looking for his way back to Ithaca, Ulysses had to descend to Hades,so that the dead seer Teiresias could \citet{tell you about your voyage -- what  stages you are to make, and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your  home.}{Odyssey}{$\!\!$, end of X} Orpheus had to visit the house of shadows toregain his love Eurydice (who however dies again on the way back, because ofOrpheus' turning around against the prohibition of Hades).  Heracles was grantedimmortality on the completion of the 12-th labour -- capturing Cerberus, theguard dog of Hades (whom, on the god's command, he had to defeat with barehands).\ftnt{For our purposes, the Underworld can be considered synonymous with  hell, though more detailed distinctions and  comparisons are easily possible. In order to keep analogy, we won't count  Elysium, the Isles of the Blest, as part of the   Underworld, while Tartarus, the place of ultimate punishment, should certainly  be included.}Paradigmatic (though written down only in the second century \add\ by Lucius Apuleius)is the story in which  {Aphrodite}, in her attempts to annihilate {Psyche}, orders her to fetch some water from{Styx} and then even to enter the Underworld and obtain a piece of beauty from{Persephone}. Only successful completion of these tasks (with some help from{Eros}) leads to the final recognition of {Psyche's} right to her divinehusband and the grant of immortality.Among other variations, involving additional aspects but still centering aroundthe same theme of temporary isolation before renewal or rebirth, we couldmention the common motif of the child who, threatened by the envious ruler, isled by the mother to a seclusion or remote country.\ftnt{E.g., Abraham according  to the midr\u{a}sh \btit{Ma`ase Avraham}, in \citeauthor*{BHM}{I:25ff.};  Jesus.} Sometimes, the future hero is abandoned in the mountains,\ftnt{Paris;  Oedipus; Cyrus the Great (who, according to the legend in \citeauthor*{Herodotus}{    I:108-113}, was not so abandoned only thanks to the disobedience of king's  executioners.)} or else placed in a boat or chest which, put adrift, reachessafely some shore far away from the civilised dwellings and where the hero ishelped and reared by modest people or even animals.\ftnt{Moses; \noo{according    to \citeauthor*{MityHebr}{XXIV:3}} Romulus and Remus; in some versions  Oedipus.}  Likewise, in the myth known already to the Sumerians and Hittites,the deluge, sent by God as a punishment and for the purification, is survived inthe isolation on the ark only by a few God-chosen ones.\ftnt{Utnapishtim from  \citeauthor*{Gilgamesh}, \thi{the first man} Manu from the Vedas,  Biblical Noah, Greek Deucalion.}  A less dramatic variant is that of beinghanged -- as if suspended, in a thin air, in a state of isolation and helplessawaiting for relief or enlightenment, as in purgatory. Jesus' death on the crosswas but the first stage before descent.  In Tarot, the Hanged Man is the cardsignaling a state of solitude and submission to the divine will, suspension betweenthe forces of heaven and earth and sacrifice bringing mystical knowledge andredemption.  Odin had hanged head down from the World Tree, Yggdrasil, for ninedays, pierced by his own spear, thereby acquiring sacred wisdom, learning ninemagical songs and eighteen magical runes.  Scholars not willing to see in thisNorse myth merely a garbled version of Christ's crucifixion, point out otherrelated motifs: in shamanism, climbing of a World Tree by the shaman in searchof mystic knowledge is a common religious pattern; sacrifices, human orotherwise, were commonly hung in or from trees, often transfixed byspears.\paWe certainly do not intend any review of mythology nor any elaborateinterpretations.  Hanging in the air may have vast structural differences fromsurviving a deluge, while we only want to see in both the aspect of isolationand complete immersion in the elemental power. We do not want to see the descend and rebirth as identical with, nor even asrelated to the cycles of nature, the eternal return of the seasons. We see it purely \co{existentially} -- rebirthis not a cyclic event of nature, but a unique possibility of \co{existence}.%(The former/latter might be considered symbols of the latter/former.)We want to see all the above as examples of the same pattern: the {\em  necessity} of a lonely descent to the Underworld, of surviving the flood(locked in a chest or ark), of temporary isolation in the air -- in orderto revive, to obtain the ultimate reward, enlightenment, salvation.\citet{Christ's soul must needs descend into hell, before it ascended into  heaven.  So must also the soul of man.}{TheolGerm}{XI} This often postulatednecessity, the assumption that the way to paradise must lead through hell,causes us some trouble.%We certainly do not want to deny the fundamental role of suffering in the%\co{spiritual} development of a person. But aAlthough suffering plays a fundamental role in the development of a person, itdoes not follow that also hell, its extreme form, is a necessary step on the wayof purification.  This necessity seems to arise only when the ultimate rewardhas the character of enlightenment, is somewhat associated with knowledge. Theknowledge-thirsty Odin hangs himself from Yggdrasil exclusively for the sake ofsacred wisdom; gnostics, equating salvation with insight, have to go through theevil world only to renounce it. Al-Ghazali makes this relation to knowledge veryclear: \citet{For were it not for night, the value of day \lin would be {\em    unknown}. Were it not for illness, the \lin healthy would not enjoy health.  Were it not for \lin hell, the blessed in paradise would not {\em know} the  \lin extent of their blessedness.}{Al-Ghazali} {56-60 \citaft{EvilFaces}{    p.54; my emph.}} The following subsection addresses our troubles withequating salvation and knowledge and clarifies the possible meaning of suchequivocation.\noo{ %perhaps add ...The reward is big: purification, eternal life, love....But there are also unlucky ones: like Theseus and Pir... who got fastenedto the Chair of Forgetfulness (only Teiresias was allowed by Persephone toretain his reason in Hades)}\subsection{Being and knowing}\label{sub:beingKnow}\pa\label{pa:notKnow} It is not necessary to \co{actually} know inorder to be; it is not necessary to know that one is in hell to be there.  Pastvisits in hell can intensify the \co{actual} realization that one is not thereany more; the realization which, perhaps in itself, can mean that one is inheaven. But it is not a necessary precondition for being in paradise, for it isequally unnecessary to \co{actually} know that one is in heaven in order to bethere.  Active search for heaven is the more suspicious, the more \co{visible} it is,and the doubts about its genuine character coincide with the doubts about thevalue of \co{actual} knowledge -- or, more generally, of the \co{visible signs} -- ofheaven.\ftnt{\citef{If any one saith, that a man, who is born again and    justified, is bound of faith to believe that he is assuredly in the number    of the predestinate; let him be anathema.}{Trent}{VI:XVI.On    Justification.15}}The insistence on the necessity of a passage through the heart of darkness inorder to reach the light, need perhaps not, in itself, be a sign of a gnosticdualism. But it has similar origins in an intellectual bias towards the\co{visibility} of \co{actual} manifestations and demonstrations.  It is notnecessary to know in order to be. But, certainly, \co{actually} knowing one poleof a contradiction requires and implies knowing the other.  It is the knowingexperience of hell which, when contrasted with the experience of heaven, makesthe fact of its presence \co{visible}.\noo{The myths of descent, or Underworld  in general, often have this aspect, too, though it is less dramatic and less  visible.} Entering the Underworld amounts to losing reality. The involvedhelplessness and nakedness indicate the aspect of purification but one findsalso the element of oblivion and forgetfulness.  Persephone takes away thememories and understanding from the souls entering the Underworld -- Theresiaswas one exception, but otherwise, the Greek dead (at least those who did not endin Tartarus nor Elysium) are shadows living in a somnambulistic unreality, indespair over the loss of and thirst for the real.  Only those who manage toreturn from there retain their mental powers or, as we might say, thestrengthened consciousness of their presence in the living reality as opposed tothe shadowy oblivion of the Underworld. The return from the Underworld does not concern somuch the purification but, primarily, the manifestation of the status of thechosen one.  Similarly, the flood does not serve the purpose of purifying thesurvivors.  They survive it {\em only because} they had already been pure, or asthe myths have it, chosen by god -- the flood only clarifies the scores, makesthe predestined results visible.\ftnt{An element of arbitrariness in the  selection of the survivor by the god appears in most flood myths: Utnapishtim  is chosen by the goddess Ishtar (the Babylonian counterpart of the Sumerian  Inanna), or sometimes Ea/Enki (Tablet XI) for no apparent, in any case no  mentioned reason; when \abr{jhvh} decides to destroy the world with the flood,  Noah simply \citefi{found grace in the eyes of the Lord}{Gen.}{VI:8};  Deucalion was a Greek, so reasons and explanations get longer, though the  bottom line remains unchanged -- he was warned about the flood by his father,  Prometheus who, although not a god but only a Titan of second generation, was  as such immortal. In the Hindu version it is \thi{the first man}, Manu, who is  warned by a fish about the coming flood (in \btit{Mahabharata} the fish is  identified with the god Brahma, while in \btit{Puranas} with incarnated  Vishnu).}Thus, we distinguish clearly the two aspects: on the one hand, the\co{invisible} event of being selected, the God's decree which for the\co{actual} understanding can easily appear as an arbitrary predestinationand, on the other hand, the \co{actual} knowledge, the \co{visible}\co{manifestations} of this fact.\pa\label{pa:beKnow}Knowledge and being are closely related but neither is any simple functionof another. Some forms of knowledge are impossiblewithout some forms of being and knowing something may promote particularway of being. As always, we will stay satisfied with fewnecessary conditions without looking for the sufficient ones. %We gather a few threads from Book I concerning being and from%Book II:\ref{sec:levels} concerning knowledge.Most abstractly, knowledge is a relation while being \co{participation}. Onemight immediately object that \co{participation}, too, is a relation but it isnot. (At least, we now want to make a distinction which earlier might have beenblurred, even by using the word \wo{relation} for \co{participation} as, forinstance, when speaking about being as an asymmetric \thi{relation}.)  Arelation, a \co{reflective} relation\ftnt{That is, not a reflexive relation, buta relation as perceived by \co{reflection}.}  presupposes \co{distinct} entitieswhich it relates.  Relation to $x$ requires $x$ to be something else,something distant, opposite, not-mine -- it requires a distance, and ifthere is no distance, the relation will create it. This distance appears as thedistance separating \co{me} from $x$, but at the bottom it is the distanceseparating the poles of the relation from their own being.  In short, relation, a\co{reflective} relation, presupposes prior being of its poles (which is butanother way of saying that \co{reflective dissociation} presupposes prior, also\co{non-actual}, \co{distinctions}.)\co{Participation} is that which {\em constitutes} the being of these\co{dissociated} (and associated) poles. Althoughit involves the \co{separation} of the \co{participating} being, it is not arelation, for it makes the poles not merely related, but intimately involvedinto each other. To the extent various relations appear as \co{traces} of prior\nexuss\ from which their \co{aspects} have been \co{dissociated}, we might evensay that \co{participation} is the limiting case, or rather the initial stage, whenthe \co{distinctions} have not as yet resulted in\co{dissociation}. \co{Participation} in $x$ requires $x$ to be \thi{greaterthan me}: I do not \co{participate} in my \co{acts} -- I perform them; I do not\co{participate} in my life -- I live it. Yet, this \thi{greater than me}, although \co{above me},is not an opposite and distanced pole of a relation but, on the contrary,something which embraces it, something very intimately mine,eventually so much mine, as my own definition, as the ground of my verybeing. We could say that \co{participation} is the relationwhich is not \thi{added} to the given entities but which constitutes their verybeing. But this mode of speaking tends to conflate the \co{horizontal} and\co{vertical} dimension and, like the assumed spatial analogies ofspirituality, confuses rather than clarifies the latter. Knowledge is concerned with the appropriation of the alien element, it stretchesalways beyond itself trying to reach what is \thi{out there}, remote and, in fact, inaccessible because by its very nature of \thi{givenness}, separated by thedistance.  It extends along the \co{horizontal} dimension of \co{transcendence}; having a fixed\thi{subjective} pole, it now tries to extend its scope along the categories anddistinctions pertaining to its level: as a \co{subject} it reaches towards the\co{object} and the objective; as an \co{ego} it thirsts for \co{more}; as\co{me} it searches for what is not-mine, whether psychological insight,subordination or understanding of others, personal love, alternative worlds\ldotsBeing, on the other hand, is concerned at most with dissemination and radiation,it does not search, it finds; it does not reach to grasp, it gives; it is quietand peaceful. It does not have to search because it already is, it does not have to climb the \co{vertical} stepsof transcendence, for these steps reflect only the perpetual anchoring of\co{actuality} in its \co{founding origin}.  Being is the \co{presence} of the\co{vertically} transcendent element, eventually, the \co{presence} of the\co{origin}.\ftnt{In I:\refpp{pa:toBeDist} and then in \ref{se:toBeDist},we said that \thi{to be is to be distinguished}. And this remains the mostgeneric notion. But being we are talking about now is a more specific being in amore specific context, namely, the being of an \co{existence} in relation to knowing.}Knowledge, as a relation, is always \co{founded} in being -- not of its object,but of itself. Relation binds the \co{distinct} poles and knowledge asks onlyabout \thi{being} of its opposite pole. But it is the being of the wholerelation which \co{founds} it and its poles.  The \co{object} of myunderstanding and the \co{concept} by which I understand it are opposite polesof a relation, they are in no way the same. But they both originate from ahigher unity, from the \co{distinctions} made in the texture of \co{experience},of \co{chaos}, eventually, of the \co{indistinct}. It is only \co{actuality}which definitely \co{dissociates} the \co{subject} and the \co{external object}.%\noo{ If we were to speak about any opposition between being and knowing, we  would not oppose \thi{knowing $x$} to \thi{$x$'s being}, or \thi{$x$'s being    for us} to \thi{$x$'s being in itself}.  Instead, we would only speak (as we  did in Book II) about two orthogonal dimensions of \co{transcendence}: the  \co{horizontal transcendence} of \co{distinctions} of the same kind versus the  \co{vertical transcendence} of the \co{foundation} in higher \co{virtuality}.  Knowledge, although relation to a distanced pole, is \co{mine} -- just like  the \co{concept}, so also its \co{object} are \co{distinguished} from \co{my    experience}, from \co{chaos}, eventually from the \co{indistinct}.  The  \co{object} is \co{external}, is not \co{myself}, and yet \co{I} never cognise  and never get to know anything except myself. This \thi{sameness}, \thi{same    kind} represent, too, the \co{horizontal} dimension of transcendence. On the  other hand, \co{I} {\em am} not only \co{myself} but more than \co{myself},  \co{I} am only because \co{I} have received my being and because \co{I} thus  \co{participate} in something higher than \co{myself}.} Knowledge, as a\co{reflective} enterprise, fixates the \co{actuality} of the \co{subject  dissociated} from the \co{object} and keeps asking about their coincidence or,at least, relation. In this way, it is indeed determined by the character of itsobject, or rather, of that which it makes into its \co{object}. As contents arefetched from different levels, knowledge must adjust its character to thecharacter of the respective contents. Thus, what we call \wo{knowledge} is muchmore than what is usually so called.\noo{\ger{Erkentnise} would be only a little  better, \he{Wissen}...perhaps...} We will now relate these abstract remarks tovarious levels and recover the more common meaning as the \co{objective} and\co{actual} form of the general notion.  The points \imm-\inv below summarisethe respective subsections\ref{sec:levelA}-\ref{sec:levelD} from Book II. %:\ref{sec:levels}\noo{ \say below interwave with \thi{kinds of reason}: If we let \wo{reason}  denote the manipulation of \rss\ (probably rather the mere {\em fact}, in any  case not any faculty), then we get variants of reason depending on the  signification of the \co{signs}:  \act utilitarian, pragmatic reason: concepts    \mine practical reason, a bit in Kantian sense, but also much more mundane, in  the sense of existential import: general ideas    \inv contemplative reason (of Plotinus, mystics...), intellect: symbols as  objects of contemplation; \thi{unity} intellect-intelligible, though not as  the \co{actual signs}, but only as what they denote/reveal}\pa \imm At the lowest level, \co{actual} contact with an \co{object} is a form ofknowing.  Whether the \co{object} is given physically -- sensed, perceived orfelt -- or else only ideally -- \thi{thought}, remembered or imagined, in acomplete \co{externality} -- is not so significant here: it does not change thefundamental importance of its proximity and \co{immediacy}, inscription withinthe \hoa.  The constitutive feature of this, say \co{immediate} knowledge, is onthe one hand its total \co{dissociation} from its \co{object}: the \co{object}is known (felt, seen, sensed, imagined) but remains \co{external}, that is, notaffected by the relation; and on the other hand, it is the emptiness of the\co{actual concept} which here reduces to the pure \co{immediacy} of\co{distinguishing} \thi{this}, the mere consciousness \co{that it is}. It isthe knowledge of \thi{this} not being \thi{that} without, perhaps, being able tospecify the difference; it is the knowledge with which I know --\co{immediately} -- my body, withoutknowing anything {\em about} it, with which I \co{immediately} know the painwithout as yet reflecting over its character and causes. \co{Subject}, i.e., the subject of this form of knowledge, apparently exhaustsits being in the relation to such an \co{external object}. But this is onlyapparent, immanent description of the relation. \co{Subject} {\em is} not by\co{acting} or re\co{acting} (cognising, perceiving, feeling, etc.) within thishorizon of \co{immediacy}, but only because it is immersed in the\co{vertically} \co{transcendent} element, because it emerges from a higher level asan \co{actualisation} of \co{ego}.  \act Essentially the same, though more developed kind of knowledge obtains atthis higher level of \co{actuality}, where \co{concepts} of elaborate\co{reflection} yield understanding of \co{complexes} -- internalised throughthis understanding, but appearing all the time as the residual\co{externalities}.  This \co{dissociated} form of knowing, \gre{episteme}(whether of \co{actual} or purely \co{immediate} kind) allows one to ruminate onthe general characteristics of knowledge and its acquisition, on the methodologyof science, on the most universal laws of reason, etc., etc., etc.  To ask anyepistemological questions, one has to assume that the crucial aspects ofknowledge can be treated independently from its object.  Such a possibilityobtains because one has already decided the scope of investigation limiting itto the \co{objective} knowledge.\noo{ Whether it happened only with Galileo and  Descartes or already with Aristotle and Plato does not concern us. Likewise,}We will not dwell on the possible definitions of what, properly and preciselyspeaking, might count as such a knowledge and distinguish it from believing,imagining or assuming. We are not looking for any criteria of \co{actual} things andrelations which are never final because they are always involved into a widersphere capable of upsetting any relative definitions. We stop here with the\co{objective} (\co{actual} or \co{immediate}) knowledge, at the mereobservation of its distinctive project to traverse the distance between the\co{actuality} and its \co{more}, between the \co{dissociated} poles of the\co{conceptual} models and the \co{external} realities.Again, although the subject of such a knowledge, \co{ego} (or what often triesto hide under the depersonalised entities like \thi{mind}, \thi{intelligence}),spends its time on associating and dissociating, matching and modeling, its{\em being} is never exhausted by such relations. \co{More} work andthinking may generate only yet \co{more} work and thinking but it never reachesany being. To get a sense of it, it has to notice the real person, \co{oneself}.\mine %life is knowledge %sophiaAs we move higher up in the hierarchy of being, the \co{dissociation} of the\thi{objective} and \thi{subjective}, or -- let it be allowed to say -- of beingand knowing, becomes less and less \co{precise}.  Being an immoralbastard is not at all affected by the fact that the person \co{actually} knowsit. Depending on what one knows and how, it may make the immorality more cynical andrepulsive, or else more amiable in its understanding of fallibility; in somecases, it may even indicate a direction of possible change.  But by \wo{knowing  that I am immoral bastard}, we refer here to the \co{objective} knowledge ofthe fact \thi{that\ldots}  This knowledge actually includes knowing various\thi{whys}, \thi{hows}, \thi{whats} but all these only signal the increased \co{reflection}, that is, \co{dissociation}. (The more systematicanalysis we attempt, the more confusion seems to result and, eventually, themore all our self-knowledge seems to reduce to the mere \thi{that} from which westarted.)  It is no particular art to know \thi{that} one is a bastard, the bigart is to cease {\em being} one. Even stupidity usually knows itself to bestupid -- it only can't help it. This gulf between knowledge and being is a gulfbetween the \co{objective} knowledge and the horizon of \co{mineness}, thedistance between the \co{actual} and the \co{non-actual}.However, as we have moved higher up in the hierarchy of being, the\co{dissociation} became less and less \co{precise}, eventually, losingcompletely its justification, if not entire sense.  \co{I} am \co{my life},\co{my life} is \co{my world}, \co{general thoughts} are as \thi{subjective} as\thi{objective}.  Looking for any \co{objective} knowledge at this level amountsto reducing it to the level of \co{actuality}.  It may be quite true that I am,indeed, an immoral bastard; it may be a fact, an \co{objective} fact. But nosuch \co{objective} truths, nor any combination and sum thereof, ever capture thetruth of \co{my} being -- at best, they may express an aspect of it, approximateit. The merging of the \thi{objective} and \thi{subjective} aspect is reflectedin a more intimate interleaving of being and knowing. Not only because hereknowing is essentially knowing \co{oneself} (possibly, another person), butbecause this knowing, if knowing it still is, loses the \co{objective} characterand does not any longer know so \co{precisely} \thi{what} it knows.The \co{general thoughts} expressed in literature or poetry, the thoughts of Vedasor Bible, the wise advice of old men or good friends -- all these teach ussomething, we learn (at least we can learn) from them and thus, perhaps,increase our~\ldots knowledge. Living through new situations, confronting new (orold) challenges, wining or losing, we learn something, but what is it that we solearn? We learn how to live, OK, but this does not say much. We learn but we donot quite know what we learn, we know more than a year ago, but we do not quiteknow what we know. We gather \thi{life experience} -- we learn something aboutthe world as much as about ourselves, for all that amounts to refining andclarifying the {\em relations} we have with the world and other people, and theways we handle them.  There is no need for making it explicit, it is knowledgewhich lives in one's body and instincts, in one's instinctive reactions and habits,in ways of responding to and initiating things,  of creatingand handling situations; only a tiny part of it becomes occasionally an\co{object} of explicit \co{reflection} or verbal expression, and even thathappens only \la{post factum}.  It is knowledge of life, of one's life, andone's life is only living this knowledge -- the \co{nexus}which, once \co{dissociated}, will never return to itself and can at most striveto reestablish some equality. To distinguish it from the\co{objective} knowledge, let us call it the \wo{life knowledge} (or, perhaps,\wo{\gre{sophia}}). It is nevertheless knowledge, for it spans the relation between \co{me} and whatis \co{mine} and, on the other end, \co{not-mine}. From this constant relationthere emerges also the residual point, the noumenal \co{self} as the center of\co{my} being.%\newpage\inv %gnosis% \co{confrontation} is a \co{nexus} of \co{separated existence} and the% \co{indisitinct One}).%% Book I, \refp{pa:thinkBeingA} -- all is \co{one} before it becomes two; and section% \ref{sub:ontoepi} -- \co{that is} is all to know about it, i.e.,...its essence% is its beingSomewhere at the bottom, past the bottom of one's soul, and somehow, definitelythough \co{imprecisely}, \co{clearly} though \co{vaguely}, one always knows\co{oneself}, one knows the basic mood and \co{quality} of \co{one's life}.  Itmay be merely recognition of the same, recurring doubts, recognition ofsomething various moods of silence seem to intimate without unveiling.  Butbeyond that, \co{above} all \co{visible signs}, one knows even more, one knowsalso if life is a generous \co{gift} or something else: a strange accident, asuffering of a constant trial without any goal or reason, only rarely interlacedwith brief pleasures; or, perhaps even an unbearable damnation, a doom ofeternal incarceration. This is no longer any \gre{episteme} or \gre{sophia}, anyform of knowledge which one could utilise and apply. This is not any \co{actual}conclusion of a state, but the mere state; something that one can nevercapture in the \co{actual} words but, nevertheless, something one alwaysexpresses -- by simply being what one is and doing what one does. It is\co{spiritual} knowledge which, at the risk of creating completely wrongassociations, let us call \wo{\co{gnosis}}.\ftnt{We are not intending here any  \co{actual} knowledge, and hence any associations with any form of the  traditional \la{gnosis} are out of place. In one respect, namely, in its  complete lack of any dualism, it might be compared to the \thi{optimist    gnosis} of neo-Platonic Renaissance which is opposed to the dualism of  traditional \thi{pessimist gnosis} in \citeauthor*{YatesGnosis}.\noo{Still,    our gnosis has nothing to do with any valuation or value -- it is    inseparable from being what one knows but it is a form of {\em only}    knowing, it still may be knowledge of good or evil which neither implies nor    is capable of any choice.}} It is knowledge of \co{nothingness} and isalways a variation of one of the two main forms.\ad{Knowing Yes}%\item (Being = knowing (in \yes))Eventually, at the \co{spiritual} level -- the level where there are not only no\co{objects}, but no \co{distinctions} which could \co{actually signify} any\co{invisible} meanings, the level raised not only \co{above} the earth but also\co{above} heavens, like a wind which \citeti{bloweth where it listeth, and  thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and  whither it goeth,}{John}{III:8\label{ftnt:wind}}  \citet{invisible [...] to mortal eyes, beyond  thought and beyond change}{Bhagavad}{II:25} -- at this level being is indeedknowing.  This knowledge, however, must not be confused with \co{actual}knowing, \co{reflective} consciousness, which are only possible but nevernecessary \co{manifestations} of the \co{spiritual} state. Being and knowing arethe same not because the \co{dissociated subject} and \co{object} mysteriouslycoincided, but because the {\em knowing} and the {\em being of the one who  knows} are here indistinguishable; because \co{nothingness} of the \co{self}is \co{confronted} exclusively with \co{nothingness} of the \co{origin}, andthus there is no longer any distinction between the \co{horizontal} and\co{vertical} dimensions of \co{transcendence}; because the only possibility ofthis level is \co{participation} in the \co{one}.  \citetib{He who knows I am  beginningless, unborn, the Lord of all the worlds, this mortal is free from  delusion, and from all evils he is free. [...] He who knows my glory and power, he  has the oneness of unwavering harmony.}{Bhagavad}{X:3-7} This is not any\thi{intellectualism}, any reduction of morality or salvation to knowledge, forthe knowledge concerned is \co{gnosis}, the knowledge of and through being, ofand through \co{participation} which is nothing else but a \co{concrete} form ofthis very \co{participation}. The \co{actual} knowledge of such truths is onlyabstract, it does not involve understanding and serves only at best as apreliminary stage, where the \co{aspects} belonging inseparably together arestill \co{dissociated}.%not actual know \subpa In II:\refp{pa:thinkBeingB}, we pointed to the primordial \co{spiritual} unityof being and thinking. This unity was not the result of any extension of\co{actual} knowledge, of any gnostic insights into the structure and details of\la{pneuma} and \la{pleroma}, nor of any idealistic coincidence of \thi{subject}and \thi{object}. On the contrary, it was the result of a total lack, of thepoor \co{nothingness} which, offering only \co{nothing}, does not provide anyground for \co{distinctions}, not to mention \co{actual} knowledge.  In terms of\co{actuality}, this knowledge (if knowledge it is) is a mere knowing \co{that},but \co{that} on the opposite end of the \co{immediate consciousness}\thi{that\ldots}, \co{that} which is not concerned with any \co{actuality}. Itonly knows itself to be an \co{existence}, a \co{confrontation}: \co{that  actuality} is immersed in the \co{non-actual} element, \co{that I am not the  master}, \co{that is}.In terms of \co{actuality} it is at best only a \co{vague} premonition,\co{imprecise} sense of \thi{Something} and, sometimes, simply the straightnegation, as when one realizes that, knowing \co{that}, one does not\co{actually} know anything specific. %(\wo{suppression}, as a psychoanalyst would say).It does not imply \co{actual} consciousness and understanding, it is notexhausted in the \co{actual signs}, it is not by any necessity manifested in anyparticular, \co{actual} form.  Its \co{sign} is rather silence, as when\citetib{the sage of silence, the Muni, closes the doors of his soul and,  resting his inner gaze between the eyebrows, keeps peaceful and even the  ebbing and flowing of breath; and with life and mind and reason in harmony,  and with desire and fear and wrath gone, keeps silent his soul before his  freedom, he in truth has attained final freedom.}{Bhagavad}{V:27-28} As arelation to the \co{absolute}, it is an \co{absolute} relation, relation whichdoes not involve any \co{distinctions} except for the primordial\co{separation}.% and which only may -- but need not and seldom does -- express itself in% particular \co{actual} states.It is not an event of insight, nor is it an insight which leaves any permanentcertainty about some \co{object} -- it only leaves permanent certainty. It is alasting, \co{spiritual} state which permeates the whole \co{actuality} with its\co{traces}, which sometimes even \co{actualises} in the revealing \co{signs},but which, primarily, is known only in the sense of permeating the whole\co{actuality} with its aura, of putting its \co{invisible} stamp on it, whichone is unable to grasp and only realizes its \co{presence}, its bare \co{that}.% \citt{immediate self-knowledge: \thi{just like one senses one's health or pain},%   in the direct \he{wsluchiwaniu sie} feeling into oneself.}{\'{S}ankara,%   {Commentary to Gita, IX:2 [after Otto, Mistyka... p.46]}}\paThis \co{spiritual knowledge} is the being of \co{spirit}. It is knowledgebecause it is relation (\co{separation} which \co{founds confrontation}), but itis being because this relation is \co{absolute}, because \co{confrontation} issimply \co{participation} in \co{one}, because there is no longer anydistinction between the \co{vertical} and \co{horizontal} dimension of\co{transcendence}.  In terms of \co{actual} understanding, it is simply knowing\co{that}: \co{that} \co{I} \co{exist} through \co{confrontation}, \co{that I am  not the master}, perhaps, \co{that} \co{I} know \co{nothing}.%and certainly nothing of the eventual significance. \co{Actually} {\em knowing}, bBeing \co{actually} certain of any such \co{that} points in the direction of \Yes. But if one asked:\wo{How can anybody be certain of such a thing?} then one can only keep asking, for \thi{how} asks already for more (that is, less) than the \co{absolute  nothingness}. One might only remember that there are many degrees of knowing\co{that} and the more definite interpretation man attempts, the furtherone is from actually knowing it.  For the \co{actual} claims to verifiablecertainty, it remains only an indefinite sense of gratitude and thankfulness which does not present, let alone fill, the soul with any thing nor image.%\subpa %(Rather inverted)\co{That} is never given, \co{that} is something one can never see or feel, forany \co{actual} state or feeling is at most a \co{sign} which, unless already{\em known}, is most naturally ignored and reduced to insignificance. Thusit is something easily contradicted by all kinds of \co{visible} examples andarguments.% -- Voltairean grimaces at Panglos' disasters and % optimistic naivit\'{e} seem so obviously convincing that they will always appeal% to adolescent \thi{rationality}.Never being given, never being any \co{actual} \thi{what}, such a \co{that} isignorance rather than knowledge.  \citeti{You will so ask: what does God effect  without `image' in the foundation and essence of the soul. I am not able to  say that, because soul's faculties can perceive only through `images'. And  because the images enter into her from outside, it remains hidden from her.  And this is most salutary for her, because this ignorance tempts her with the  mystery of something wonderful and makes her chase it. For she feels very well  \co{that} it is, but does not know \thi{what} it  is.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Mistyka}{ A:II.4.b\kilde{p.36} my emph.}}  \co{That} isbeyond any \thi{what} and need no \thi{what} -- and this is all to be knownabout \co{that}. Consequently, \co{that} can not be known without being it,because as long as I am not \co{that}, I really do not know it, my \co{actual}pseudo-knowledge of \co{that} never goes beyond the insecurity of a merelypossible hypothesis, a vulgar idea of faith. The apparent paradox would be that,since \co{existence} is \co{confrontation}, every one knows \co{that}, too.Indeed, but in \co{actual} terms this \co{spiritual knowledge} has rather theform of ignorance, it takes only the form of a \thi{merely possible hypothesis},the one which is as difficult to accept as it is to get rid of. It is expressedby \co{thirst} and perpetual search for the ultimate. It is, in short, unknowing knowledge -- a mere relation to the \co{absolute} without anyreflection in the \co{actuality}, a being reduced to knowledge which does notknow what it is, which keeps searching for \co{more} without realizing howlittle there is to be known. For in order to {\em know} it -- not merely imagineit as a possibility, posit it as a thought experiment but \co{actually} know --one has to renounce the project of \co{actually} knowing, that is, dominatingit, one has to {\em be} on the \yes-side.  Living \No\ it is impossible to know\Yes, for living \No\ means precisely accepting only \co{visibility} and denyingany meaning to the ultimate \co{transcendence}. Living \Yes, on the other hand,is nothing more than renouncing \No. But what is renouncing other thandismissing what it renounces as unworthy or untrue, that is, knowing better?Living \Yes\ may have almost any imaginable \co{actual} form and may involve anykind of \co{actual} knowledge. For the knowledge it {\em is}, is not concernedwith anything \co{actual}, it is not knowledge of this or that, it is notknowledge {\em of} anything. It is only the \co{vaguest} peace of the ultimate\co{participation}, the peace which is known because it marks all the\co{actuality} with its \co{invisible rest}, yet which itself never\co{actualises}. If you try to point at it, to capture \thi{what} of thisknowledge, it evaporates, but if you let it be, it remains with the most\co{clear presence} and \co{absolute} certainty. \citet{In what concerns divine  things, belief is not fitting. Only certainty will do. Anything less than  certainty is unworthy of God.}{WeilWaiting}{Forms of the Implicit Love of  God:Implicit and explicit love;p.139. Such a \co{spiritual knowledge} amounts  to (a variant of) what has been called \wo{ontologism}, for instance, of  St.~Bonaventure and his followers. Indeed, (1) the \co{absolute} is the first  not only in the order of Being but also in the order of knowing (\co{gnosis}  is the constant knowledge of Godhead, if not of God.)  \noo{(the Aristotelian    principle \la{Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in sensu} is    wrong) i,e.,} (2) This knowledge is intuitive, not abstractive -- it really  coincides with the fact of \co{existing}. The last point, (3) that in the  light of the idea of \co{absolute} we acquire all other ideas, can be taken or  rejected, depending on the meaning of \wo{idea}. If it is an intellectual  construction, proceeding from the \co{reflective dissociations}, then only its  strife after unity reminds about this first knowledge. But if idea is taken as  anything whatsoever which can be distinguished and conceptualised, then  certainly it arises only from the \co{indistinct}.\noo{(like everything    else)... [St.~Bonaventure seems to have been similarly ambiguous on the    issue; cf.~Gilson.]} }\newp \ad{Knowing No}The \co{existential confrontation} is nothing else but this \co{participation},and even the most active \No\ is only turning away from it, and thus is still\co{confronting} it.  It might thus seem that \No\ is a possibility of the sameorder as \Yes, that it is but another alternative. It is, however, an event of adifferent order -- it does not reach the \co{absolute}.  It only denies:refusing to be through \co{confrontation}, refusing to \co{participate} in the\co{origin}, it seems to remove this \co{transcendent} pole but, as a matter offact, it only pushes it away at an inaccessible distance, reduces it to a mererelation, exchanges being for {\em mere} knowledge.  \citet{To despair is to lose the  eternal}{Despair}{I:C.B.b.$\alpha$.1\kilde{p.82}} says Kierkegaard.Seemingly, one might know that one lost the eternal, but what {\em knowing} isthat? What do \co{I} {\em know} then, what is it that I so {\em know}?  Nothing,except my \co{actual} state, feelings of despair, irrecoverable loss, sense ofdamnation -- I know the \co{distance}, impassable, from here to eternity whichappears as the ultimate emptiness.  My knowledge may be quite correct, I mayknow how it feels and even what I feel but is it~\ldots knowledge? In fact, Ihave hardly any idea of what is going on, for it is impossible to lose theeternal, simply and plainly impossible. We live in it, whether we feel it ornot, and the despair of the loss is the despair over one's own \co{actuality} --not over the loss of the eternal but over the loss of the contact with it, ofits \co{concrete presence}.  Knowledge of the loss, of having lost the eternal,eventually, knowledge of being in hell, will seldom call things with such words.But it knows them because it lives them, it lives its \No, and no matter howrosy all \co{actual} things really are, at the bottom it is scared by thegnawing suspicion of their insufficiency, of a mistake, of the \co{distance}which no longer relates but divides. The lost eternal is the lost \co{spirit}or, as one used to say, the sold soul. But it is lost in spite of the fact thatit can not be lost; it is only the feeling of loss one despairs over. Thedespair is real because it is deeply felt, but the loss over which it despairsis completely untrue.\noo{\citeti{The light of the body is the eye: if therefore    thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.  But if thine    eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness.  If therefore the    light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that    darkness!}{Mt.}{VI:22-23}} Despair is indeed to say something like \wo{I  have lost the eternal} and think that it can count for \thi{knowing}, that itcan mean anything more than a mere status report of one's \co{actual} state andfeelings.  %\subpa %(Inverted)As with the \co{spiritual knowledge} of \yes, we are by no means implying thatone always has full consciousness of \No.  For the most, we \co{actually} do notknow it.  This was the reason for objecting in \refp{pa:notKnow} against the\co{actual} knowledge as a necessary \co{sign} of the \co{spiritual} state.  The\co{actual} knowledge will often be an \co{inversion} of the factualstate.\noo{\citet{[T]he more consciousness the more intense the    despair.}{Despair}{72} says Kierkegaard, but he also admits that the first  stage of despair is exactly the state of not realizing that one is in  despair.} Yet, \co{actually} knowing \No\ can be also something like aprevailing sense of \co{ingratitude}, disappointment, meaninglessness orunreality, which in the \co{reflective} form turn into negation of some of theearlier mentioned \co{that}'s: \co{I} control my \co{existence}, \co{I} am themaster, \co{I} know. In the extreme cases, it may be also \co{actual}realization that I am damned, which opens the doors to deeper hell. As hell,with its despair over mere \co{visibility}, is much closer to earth than the\co{invisible} paradise, it is easier to imagine a kind of certainty -- comingclose to the \co{actual} knowledge -- of being in the former than in the latter.Any prolonged suffering gives an intimation and, however inadequate, an image ofit.  One has observed that traditional representations of paradise -- whether inpainting, sculpture or literature -- are unbearably dull and monotonous ascompared to the fascinatingly complex and eventful representations of hell.This could be classified merely as a result of the simple psychology ofmass-media and news reports (according to which devastating tragedy, being moreintriguing and fascinating, sells better than peaceful happiness). We would,however, see here an expression of a deep difference: heaven generates few, ifany, univocal \co{visible signs}, it does not inspire our imagination with anydefinite images as hell does. And there is good reason for it: the former is thepoint of ultimate \co{invisibility} embracing {\em everything} \co{visible}, andthen the bare reflection of \co{nothingness}, while the latter is exactly itsnegation, not only directedness towards \co{visibility}, but {\em exclusive}directedness towards \co{visibility} and {\em only} \co{visibility}. Thedistinction between directedness and exclusive directedness (toward \co{this  world}) is impossible to define \co{precisely}, and so the gnostic tendency toidentify \co{this visible world} with the source of all and only evils (if notwith the hell itself) is and will be the constant theme in the history ofspirituality.\ad{Not a mystical state -- its foundation} Since this might look like someobscure mysticism, let us clarify one crucial point.  That an \co{existence} isa \co{confrontation} with the \co{origin} can now be said equivalently as: an\co{existence} {\em is} its \co{spiritual knowledge}, for this knowledge isnothing else but living it, whether one knows it \co{actually} or not.  What weare intending must not be confused with any particular form of \co{actuality},whether \co{actual} insight or some mystical states.%% which, after many mystics, James characterises as% having a \thi{noetic quality}, for \citet{although so similar to states of%   feeling, mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states%   of knowledge.}{Varieties}{XVI\&XVII}%Such states are often described as experiences of union, if not identity, experiences in which the seer \citet{cannot then see or distinguish what he  sees, nor does he have the impression of two entities; rather, it is as if he  has become someone else, and no longer \co{himself}.}{Plotinus}{VI:9.10} Butsuch peculiar \co{experiences} are not needed. They are only\co{actual signs} announcing a new mode of experiencing \co{open} to the\co{absolute presence} beyond any \co{actual} contents. Like return from theUnderworld (which itself can be such \co{an experience}), they only give an\co{actual} expression to something which can be lasting and effective alsowithout such intense \co{experiences}. \co{Nothingness} of the \co{self} is the \la{imago} of \co{nothingness} of the\co{origin}.  \citeti{Just like Godhead is nameless and remote from any name, so  also the soul is nameless. For it is the same as  God.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Mistyka}{ A:I.3.c \kilde{p.23}}} But \co{unity} is notunion -- in any case, not any understood flatly as some experienced coincidencewith the \co{absolute}. With Eckhart, too, God (\la{deus}) is not the highestprinciple. His \la{Eynikeyt} is only soul's identity with it and not withGodhead (\la{deitas}). But \citetib{God and Godhead are as different as heaven  and earth. But heaven is still thousand miles higher. And so is Godhead above  God. God becomes and passes by.}{Eckhart}{{A:I.3.e\kilde{p.25/26}}} We are notconsidering any \co{actually} experienced coincidence. We are considering the primordial\co{unity} of the two dimensions -- \co{vertical} and \co{horizontal} -- of\co{existence}, of being as \co{participation} and knowing as \co{gnosis}, whichonly when \co{dissociated} in terms of \co{objective} knowledge, give raise to asearch for \co{actual} experiences.  Once \co{dissociated}, it is impossible toimagine the \co{unity} of the two, for imagining requires images while hereevery image is inadequate.\ftnt{It becomes equally impossible to decide the  order of dependence: whether being precedes knowledge or other way around.  The first sentence of the following suggests the former, while the last one  the latter: \citef{It is not possible for anyone to see anything of the things    that really exist unless he becomes like them.

Such \co{experiences} are probably the most intense \co{signs} of\co{self} and its direct \co{confrontation} with \co{one}.  In a sense, one hasto \thi{forget \co{oneself}} in order to become \co{self} and reach the \co{spiritual} purity. But \thi{forgetting oneself} doesnot mean \thi{wiping oneself out}, only wiping out the \co{attachment} to\co{mineness}, the preoccupation with what is \co{mine} and what is not. AsGabriel Marcel would say: stopping the insistence on {\em having} (things, experiences)marks the beginning of {\em being}. It is still \co{I} who {\em am},\co{I} who {\em am} experiencing, but the \co{concreteness} of this {being} of\co{mine} means only \co{humble} appreciation of the experience withoutdissolution in it. If this sounds like a paradox, then probably it is one,because it means suspension of the \co{dissociation} into \co{subject} and\co{object} and termination of the \co{objectivistic illusion}, according towhich everything is an \co{object} and \thi{real} are only \co{actually visible},only \co{precisely} discernible \co{objects} or feelings and not also some\co{vaguely present rest}.\ftnt{Both, apparently contradictory aspects, of  \thi{forgetting oneself} and remaining oneself, are contained  in the short formulation: \citef{How, in fact, could God be all in all things    if there remained in man something of man? His substance will no doubt    continue to be, but under another form, another power and another    glory.}{BernardLove}{X}\kilde{GilsonHCPh,p.165} According to St.~Bernard, the  union amounts to harmony of wills, not to any confusion of substances.}The \co{spiritual} dimension of \co{self} does not in any sense abolish\co{myself}. The \co{unity} is not, in any case not necessarily, any felt and\co{actually experienced} union, and it obtains whether one has such mystical\co{experiences} or not. Having them can at most make the otherwise only\co{vaguely} felt \co{presence} more \co{clear}.  \citet{Neither temporality nor  the feelings of the soul are central to this state [...] The duration of the  state is not significant to Plotinus, nor are the phenomenological  characteristics evinced in the experience. These would be distractions to the  soul's true task, for they lie, in Plotinus' taxonomy, at the level of  sense-perception, an outwards directed aspect of the psyche.

It is \co{an experience} of    the unity and as such \co{an actual experience}, it is also the proof of its    own failure, witness to the difference between this \co{actuality} and    \co{non-actuality}.        \co{Invisibles} do not abolish \co{myself}, they only \co{transcend} the    level of \co{mineness}.  To the extent that \co{invisible manifests} itself,    it does so for \co{me}.  And then, even if it does not \co{manifest} itself    as a \co{command} or \co{inspiration}, it still presents a challenge to    \co{myself}, the challenge put by \co{my self} to \co{myself}.  Like with    everything that visits the \hoa, it is \co{I} who am confronted with it,    \co{I} have to try to understand something of it, of its relation to its    \co{signs} and \co{my} relation to it.  And, unless \co{I} have received    very particular gifts and favours, the only way for \co{me} is to work    through the \co{signs} toward what they reveal.        \co{Invisibles} \co{manifest} themselves to \co{me}, it is \co{I} who    \co{re-cognise} or experience happiness, love, beauty.  This may lead    \co{me} to believe that they have a \thi{subjective} character, that only    \co{I} partake in them, or else that others do while \co{I} do not.  But    there is a difference between observation, thinking or feeling and following    a \co{command}.  One may observe other's happiness without experiencing it,    without taking part in it, perhaps even envying it, that is, without    experiencing this happiness as \co{incarnated}, without it being    \co{revealed} to one.  Observing and envying are, however, acts of    \co{myself} which belong to \co{this world}.  They are instances of the    \co{separating} activity of \co{myself}, of the \co{dissociating} activity    of \co{reflection}.        \tsep{end inserted from II}} % end \noo added and inserted  % The mystical knowledge, as a particular insight or state, is an% \co{actualisation} of the \co{spiritual knowledge}, an \co{actual experience} of% \Yes.

Eckhart's \thi{unknowing knowing}, or\la{docta ignorantia} of his dedicated reader Cusanus, are of the similar kind.% Now, such a knowledge (a mystical insight, if you like), turns out to be only an% \co{actual sign} of \la{gnosis}, of the \co{spiritual knowledge} which is the% same as \co{spiritual} being.In the XX-th century, Karl Rahner advanced forcefully the thesis of the positivecontent of \thi{incomprehensibility} as the primary name for God.  Evenone thinking that the world is simply the \co{totality} of (logical) facts amenable to acomplete analysis may be tempted to say: \citet{What we cannot speak about we  must pass over in silence,}{Tract}{7} thus repeating the credo of negative theology:\citet{and the hidden Mysteries which lie beyond our view we have honoured by  silence}{Celestial}{XV}, \citet{God is invisible and beyond expression by words  [...

Theadjective \thi{hidden} is therefore useful only in a metaphorical sense: the\co{origin}, God -- or, following Eckhart's distinction,\noo{to which we will  return in Section \ref{se:GodGodhead},} the Godhead -- is hidden because no\co{visible} categories of understanding, requiring \co{distinctions}, areapplicable to the \co{indistinct one}. It is hidden but it is not hiding. For\co{reflection} this difference is crucial because we thus limit theunderstanding of the \co{invisible origin}, \la{Deus absconditus}, merelyagainst all differentiation, without suggesting any particular contents, not tomention \co{objective} contents, which might be hiding there.% One must only avoid the tendency to interpret it in any \co{actual} manner, as% some inadequate knowledge, as some failed attempt to define the indefinable% which, nevertheless, hides something definite. \co{Nothing} is not only all that% {\em we can} know, but all that {\em there is} to know.\noo{ \say Forms of unity? : \act actual experience (mystical experience,  James...); \mine the lived unity (?)

Thetransition amounts to this \co{spiritual knowledge} becoming, in one form oranother, \co{concretely present}. This knowledge amounts to recognition ofrelativity of all \co{visible} things and here relativity means completeirrelevance for the \co{absolute} or, let us pretend some circularity,insufficiency for salvation. None of these things can help in finding an exitand the \co{awareness} of this insufficiency, the renouncement of \co{idols}, iswhat was traditionally called \wo{purity}. The most \co{concrete} way to this\co{awareness} goes through suffering -- yet, suffering which does not breakone's person but liberates, that is, purifies one.  Return from the Underworldis the extreme image of the most extreme form of it.  One who has suffered {\em  knows} what suffering is and \thi{what} of suffering involves unmistakably\co{that}. For in the face of suffering all \thi{whats}, all reasons,explanations, justifications, correct as they may be, lose all relevance. Theymay serve for future considerations how to avoid further sufferings but theycannot help the one who is suffering now. Behind this simple and painfulobservation that one is suffering, there hides an even deeper \co{that}.%For who knows, \co{actually} and \co{objectively},  \thi{what} suffering is?Suffering, depriving one of all \co{visible} hope, can break the \co{soul} whichhenceforth becomes capable only of clinching desperately to the reminders of its \co{visible} world as they turn gradually into insignificant emptiness.But one can also manage to go through it unbroken, which is possible only when one leaves all \thi{whats} where they belong andfinds the source of strength \co{transcending} all \co{visibility}, beyond thedoors opened miraculously in response to one's \wo{Release me\ldots} The\co{self}-respect resulting from such a trial has nothing to do with anyfeelings of complacency and satisfaction with \co{oneself}. It is a true respectfor \co{self} which, erasing all pretensions to one's ultimate power andabilities, makes one admit \co{that I am not the master}. Such \co{that}, reachedin suffering, is a liberation of a purified soul. %  The more specific and \co{precise} such% \thi{whats} become, the less understanding of suffering they convey. % Suffering can not be explained to one who did not suffer. Or let us put it% better: {\em if} there were a person who did not suffer, one could not explain% to him what suffering is.\paJames distinguished between the religious attitude of once-born and twice-born.The first represents \citet{the healthy-minded temperament, the temperament  which has a constitutional incapacity for prolonged  suffering,}{Varieties}{VI\&VII} for whom \citetib{the world is a sort of  rectilinear or one-storied affair, whose accounts are kept in one  denomination, whose parts have just the values which naturally they appear to  have, and of which a simple algebraic sum of pluses and minuses will give the  total worth. Happiness and religious peace consist in living on the plus side  of the account.}{Varieties}{VIII}% As far as I can tell, such people are simply a psychological invention, and a bad% one for that, since built on a purely external view.\ftnt{I have to admit, though, that% examples of sectarianism or flat idealism quoted by James give% enough sense of superficiality. We won't analyse his reasons for classifying them% among religious attitudes.}\citetib{Now in contrast with such healthy-minded views as these, if we treat  them as a way of deliberately minimising evil, stands a radically opposite  view, a way of maximising evil, if you please so to call it, based on the  persuasion that the evil aspects of our life are of its very essence, and that  the world's meaning most comes home to us when we lay them most to  heart.}{Varieties}{VI\&VII}Although the world is indeed full of tempting superficialities and charmingplatitudes, \thi{a constitutional incapacity for prolonged suffering} is almosta contradiction in terms. One could, perhaps, imagine some people whose goalsand thoughts were so simple and means so rich that they could obtain everythingthey wished.  But it seems like an idealized image, for everybody lives his\co{confrontation} and knows \co{that}.  Many a one will try to escape fromsuffering, but suffering is exactly something from which there is no escape.\citet{For there cannot be a \thi{suffering} at all except where something  happens against one's will; no one \thi{suffers} when he accomplishes his will  and when what happens delights him.}{AbelardEthics}{\para 18} If you canescape from it, it may be a problem, a trouble, but not a suffering. A\thi{constitutional incapacity for suffering} might characterise a superficialcharacter from a \abr{tv}-series or a suicide candidate, not a healthy-mindedtemperament.  Suffering is one of the fundamental forms of meeting the ultimate\co{transcendence}, of being sentenced to something one can not stand and, bythe same token, being called to \co{transcend oneself}. \thi{Healthy-mindedness}can in this context refer at most to the ability to face suffering and thestrength which does not yield to its possibly devastating influence. We do notmake the distinction between those who can, or even need suffer, and those whocan not -- if it is a meaningful distinction, it is only psychological.\ftnt{One  might probably look at James' personal fascination with Emerson, whom he  mentions as an example of \thi{healthy-mindedness}, and the opposition between  Emerson's idealized strength and James' own post-war, depressive years, as the  background of this distinction.} We distinguish between those who suffer butdo not end in hell and those suffer and do.  Hell is the extreme form ofsuffering, the place where the suffering, initially human, becomes, by beinganswered with the active \No, almost inhuman, impersonal. \Yes\ does not requirea descent to such depths.  Yet, besides the fact that suffering is a common lotand that some can find themselves at its bottom, the opposition to hell providesthe most clear illustration of the dynamics as well as the meaning of the \sch\ of \Yes. For just like \No\ ends up substantialising its suffering as\thi{objective} evil, so \Yes\ learns that salvation is not the liberation fromsuffering but from and that the former need not involve the latter.  We willtherefore follow this opposition in describing the choice of \Yes.\subsection{Yes}\label{sub:yes}%\tsep{inserted from II}\pa\label{pa:manifest1} Our vocation is to listen, not to talk; to listen to thesilent \co{presence} which fills our life with all its contents.  And\citeti{not knowing how to listen, neither can one speak.}{Heraclitus}{DK  22B19} At the deepest level of our being, at the point where \co{one} becomesmany, the \co{invisibles} become \co{present} in the ways which we can hardlyfeel, and never control.  Without any \co{reflective attention}, the\co{invisibles} are \co{present} as the most constant \co{distinctions} -- notmoods, not feelings, not thoughts -- which do not have any \co{objective}content and which do not pertain to any \co{object}; which therefore can bepredicated of everything, though we will tend to ascribe them to the mostgeneral ideas, to life, world, existence.The experience \co{that I am not the master} is what makes true listeningpossible.  Since my control over all \co{visible} things does not exhaust mylife, there are, perhaps, other voices worth listening to. In the \co{reflective  experience}, the \co{invisibles} can be \co{present} as {unreal} dreams,{impossible} ideals, something we long for without any hope to obtain it -- notbecause we are unable to hope, but because we are unable to imagine \thi{what}we are hoping for.  Such dreams turn out to be much more \thi{real} than all the\thi{reality} of \co{actual} objects and situations, not only because they aremore persistent but also because they persist with the calm and yet intense andirrefutable force.  They do not go away as long as what they announce does notfind a \co{concrete}, incarnate \co{presence} in our life.  They are onlyimages, always false ones, but these images remind us of something which,apparently forgotten, remains \co{present} \co{above} all our \co{acts} and\co{activities}, \co{above} all \co{visible} and \co{invisible distinctions}.\citet{[...]  and St.~Philip said: `Lord, show us the Father and it will suffice  us', for the `Father' indicates birth and not likeness, and it denotes the One  in which likeness is reduced to silence and all that desires to be is  still.}{EckDivConsol}{II\kilde{p.73}}Imagine a man whose whole life was, by any reasonable standards, a series offailures and disasters, an unhappy, unrealized, misfortunate life.

And thus, there can be no cure against them, for the onlymedicine one could possibly accept would have to be \co{visible}. Insisting onobjectivity or inter-subjectivity, on externality or demonstrations, one wantsonly one thing: to be convinced {\em in advance}, that is, to avoid thediscomfort of trust, to accept only what one finds acceptable, to keep one'slife unchanged.

Forthe moment we are concerned only with the event itself.\ftnt{This double aspect  -- of re- and -birth, of repetition and new \co{foundation} -- is expressed  marvelously by the Greek expression \gre{gennethe anothen}. \gre{Anothen} is  sometimes translated as \thi{anew}, \thi{again} (e.g., \wo{Except a man be born {\em      again}, he cannot see the kingdom of God} or \citefi{Ye must be born {\em      again}}{John}{ III:3/7}) But more often, it means \thi{from above} (\wo{He    that cometh {\em from above} is above all}, \citefi{Thou couldest have no    power against me, except it were given thee {\em from above}.}{John}{    III:31/XIX:11} In Acts XXVI:25, it is rendered as: \wo{Which knew me    {\em from the beginning}}.)  Likewise, \gre{anagennao}, appearing in 1 Peter  I:23, \wo{Being born {\em again}, not of corruptible seed, but of    incorruptible,} and meaning literally \thi{to produce again}, is also used in  metaphorical sense for having one's mind and attitude changed. As is often the  case, attempting to disambiguate such apparent ambiguities, is to confuse the  issue rather than to clarify it. Both aspects are present and \co{second    birth} is as much second as it is birth, as much resurrection  from the dead as birth from the new \co{foundation above}.}\pa As one sinks into the hell of despair, one gradually accepts despair for itsown sake, as the inescapable lot and damnation. And one is advised to continue,for \citet{whilst a man is thus in hell, none may console him, neither God nor  the creature, as it is written, `In hell there is no  redemption.'}{TheolGerm}{XI, [Probably, reference to Ps. ILIX:8: \wo{For the    redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever}.]}  When onestarts despairing, the only thing one can do is todespair more. %\citet{???}{???}{Kierkegaard}%But this despair is not any emotional complain, ruefulness, nor any sense ofundeserved loss, which all reflect only the conviction of entitlement. Onlyheroes wander in the Underworld, for it takes courage and determination tosay: \citetib{Let me perish, let me die! I live without hope; from within and from  without I am condemned, let no one pray that I may be released.}{TheolGerm}{XI}\citeti{Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in whichit was said, There is a man child conceived.}{Job}{III:3}% {Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;%  Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?}{Job III:21-22}As long as it stops short of pronouncing the ultimate \No, such a resignation isin fact an expression of deepest \co{trust} and \co{hope}.  For underneath alldespair and resignation, one has always an \co{invisible} reserve, a \co{rest}unable to accept the situation to which one has already given one's consent, an\co{invisible rest} which underneath all \wo{Let me perish, let me die!}  says,in a silent, unheard voice: \wo{I am damned, I can't expect anything, so I have  to perish. {\em But I do not want to!!!}}  This apparently childish andirrational act -- not even of will, for it is a mere exclamation, and hardly anyfactual \co{act} but one made at the bottom of one's soul -- comprises the essence ofthe survival.  Intensifying despair has the meaning, for only then one can reachthe \co{invisible} seed of \co{hope}, expressed in such an event. This\noo{I  have to, even though I do not want to} is the admission that \co{I am not the  master}, that I would like to leave the place, but I can not do it on my own.It is a desperate scream for help and, as such, already an expression of\co{trust}. It is not any faith, it does not believe {\em in anything}, it doesnot hope {\em for anything}, it only turns towards \co{nothing} and admits,without saying: \wo{This is unbearable}.  This apparent surrender, this deepestresignation in the face of \co{nothingness}, is a \co{sign} of \co{trust}. Aslong as it does not say it explicitly, when it is no longer able to say it, thenit really says: \wo{Please, release me\ldots} For \citet{to {\em believe} in  one's own undoing is impossible.}{Despair}{I:C.The forms of this sickness  (despair)A.b.$\beta$\kilde{p.69}}% \kom% The choice is not between good and evil -- such a choice is impossible, for even% \wo{Evil, be thou my good} seeks only good.

What matters to us hereis the fact, rather than the intensity, of the apparent paradox: theimpossibility of any \co{visible} release and, on the other hand, theimpossibility of accepting this lack, \citetib{that in human terms the undoing is  certain and that still there is possibility.}{Despair}{\noo{I:C.The forms of this sickness (despair)A.b.$\beta$\kilde{p.70}}} \co{Trust}does not appear between these two -- \co{trust} {\em is just the tension} ofthis, as one would like to call it, paradox, is just the ability to live (with)it.\ftnt{This is only an apparent paradox, because it  appears so only \wo{in human terms}, from the perspective of \co{this world},  of one who expects sufficient, preferably even \co{visibly} demonstrable  reasons. But the transition is, in truth, very well possible. \woo{Health is    in general to be able to resolve contradictions,}{Despair-I:C.The forms of    this sickness (despair)A.b.$\beta$\kilde{p.70}}   so turning the lack of \co{visible} sufficient reasons into a  \thi{contradiction} is then the exact opposite of health.    The Greek \gre{pistis}, translated usually as \wo{faith} or \wo{belief}, can  be, and often should be, rendered as \wo{fidelity}, \wo{assurance} or  \wo{loyalty}. (This is even clearer in the primary verb, \gre{peitho}, from  which \gre{pistis} is derived, and which means to persuade or be persuaded  (e.g., Mt.XXVII:20,XXVIII:14, Acts XXI:14), to trust (Mt.XXVII:43, Lk.XI:22),  to obey (Acts V:36-37).) Besides reliance, this openness for \thi{persuasion}  (or conversion) is the primary \co{aspect} of \co{trust}.} It has the dualaspect of faith and hope, both understood in the \co{spiritual} sense, that is,without relation to anything \co{visible}.  It is only admitting the unbearablecharacter of the present state, is a mere reaction which, however, is directed{\em against} it, without recognition of any chance to overcome it.  (Again, the\co{reflective} consciousness presents one only with the desperate andunbearable life, and knows little about the \co{trust} which might underlie it.)This \thi{against} carries the character of faith, hides the impossiblepossibility of overcoming that which, according to all \co{visible signs}, cannot be overcome. As such, it has also the seed of \co{hope} -- not any definitehope as to how this impossibility could, perhaps, occur, but \co{hope} containedalready in the very exclamation -- disrespecting all the \co{visible} proofs tothe contrary and asking for help where no possible source thereof can be seen.The help it is asking for concerns absolutely \co{nothing}, it is not help to dothis or obtain that, it is not help {\em to anything}, for the one who is cryinghas not the slightest idea what he needs help to. In such a time, \wo{[t]he soul  knows for certain only that it is hungry. The important thing is that it  announces its hunger by crying. A child does not stop crying if we suggest to  it that perhaps there is no bread. It goes on crying just the same.}\wo{Release me\ldots} -- not pronounced loudly, not pronounced at all, but livedunderneath the despair -- that is all.  Release me whence? How?

Beyond it, there is nothing within.}{Philip}{} This  fullness means only} that emptiness is untrue, that beyond it there is~\ldots\thi{Something}, and hence that there is an exit, even if \co{invisible}. Thesilent cry \wo{Release me!} is the witness of that, for the most real is thatwhich you can not live without. At the same time, the cry is also an admissionthat \co{I} do not have the power to exit on my own. After all, \co{I} do notsee any exit. The \sch\ says \yes\ at first only in the form of acceptingdamnation and despair and yet, in spite of that, not accepting it, nourishingsomewhere in the depth the inadmissible \co{trust} that, after all, \co{I} won'tstay here forever. This paradox reveals only the insufficiency of any\co{actual} choice (or, for that matter, of anything \co{I} can do) to effectthe transition. All \co{I} can do is to say \Yes, first in the deep silence of\co{invisibility}, then perhaps in a louder and more conscious voice. But sayingso \yes\ is only saying that \co{I} am willing to accept the possibility ofrelease, that \co{I} indeed ask, seek and knock and hope that \citeti{every one  that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh  it shall be opened.}{Mt.}{VII:8}\noo{The impossibility of believing in one's  own undoing, especially when deprived of any possibility of exit, is the same  as the fact that \citet{[f]ar from the destitute of a divine idea is    man}{Stromata}{V:14}.} The cry, knocking or, as we can also say, the mereconsent \co{opening} one to the possibility, is all one can do. It is \equi\ with the infinite patience because, as one can not do anything, all one can dois to wait; and as one has ceased waiting for anything \co{visible} to occur, onemust wait \co{eternally}, that is, \co{above} time. \citet{[I]t is necessary  that one has the patience to begin so, that one in truth admits, that it is a  feat of patience}{Taalmod}{IX.To gain one's soul in patience;p.155} and onlyof patience, through which one gradually regains one's soul.

As usual, we do not know the sufficient conditions, but here they havebeen given a name -- \wo{grace}.\ftnt{It would be probably closer to the actual  grace, which is withdrawn after the performance of the \co{act} for which it  was granted, than to the sanctifying grace, which has the constant, habitual  effect and makes one permanently holy, but we will leave such distinctions to  the theologians.} Since we do not deal with the sufficient conditions,\wo{\co{grace}} will mean for us simply the possibility of the apparently andhumanly impossible, the fact that, although there is no \co{visible} exit, somepeople do return from hell.  \co{Trust} is thus \co{openness} to the possibilityof \co{grace} and both together can become effective only when \co{I} have said\Yes, admitted \co{that I am not the master}, that \citet{I live yet do not live  in me.}{StJohnPoems}{}%As said about suicide in \refp{suic=no} -- it, too, tries to \co{transcend},%only that one can not transcend into nothingness\co{I am not the master} and so \co{grace} is a \co{gift}, a true -- that is,undeserved (or, as a philosopher might prefer to say, unaccounted for) -- \co{gift}.But it is not a gift from anybody, for \co{I} have not found any other,particular master. Just like \co{hope} and \co{thrust} are directed towards andask into \co{absolute nothingness}, so \co{grace} comes only from there, it is a\co{gift} of \co{nothingness}. It did not come from any \co{visible} place; it isonly all surrounding \co{nothingness} which is the source, the \co{origin} ofthis \co{gift}.  One can receive gifts coming from no one, from \co{nothingness},and one can likewise be thankful without being thankful to anybody.\co{Spiritual thankfulness} does not concern anything in particular -- itconcerns \co{nothing}, that is, everything.  It is not even thankfulness {\em  for} \co{grace}, for \co{thankfulness} is but an \co{aspect} in the \nexus\ of\co{grace}.\newp\ad{Ex nihilo?}\label{pre:exnihilo} The \sch\ of \yes\ finds \co{invisible}richness of the \co{origin} in the \co{indistinct nothingness} which for \No\ remains an irrelevant void. \yes\ creates something which was not there before:from the deepest \co{thirst} for \thi{Something}, from the thoroughly logical\co{actuality} of solipsism, perhaps, from the deepest despair of emptiness, itemerges into the full \co{presence}, from the {knowledge} \co{that}, it emergesinto \co{participation}, into Being.  It thus seems to create \la{ex nihilo},from the total emptiness.  It looks like an arbitrary decision, perhaps, a mereprojection, and those who like will always see it in this way. But it is onlythe assumption of emptiness, the assumption that \co{nothingness} is indeedvoid, which makes everything that follows \Yes\ into a mere projection. Such anassumption wants, first of all, to {\em see} some definite reasons which wouldoppose it, which would invalidate the sense of emptiness. But no such reasonscan be given and then everything that follows turns into a void equal to thatwhich is there from the start -- in human, \co{visible} terms, indeed, \la{nihil  ex nihilo}, \citet{nothing can come out of what does not  exist.}{AristPhysics}{187a.33-34} In short, this is a way of saying \No, andwe are not concerned with it any more.  The \co{choice} of \yes\ does not create \la{ex nihilo} (which form of creation pertains to Godhead alone). It turns \co{alienation} into \co{concrete   participation} and thus, creates good from evil.  It creates \co{participation} by {\em finding} the \co{origin}, non-emptiness, {\em   finding} fullness where before it found only emptiness.  To see here only a projection is the same as to see nothing, as denying the meaning of the whole event, as \wo{dragging the revelation of the greater down to the level of one's   littleness.}$^{{\rm{II}}:\ref{cit:little}}$  In fact, it seems possible, at least logically, to maintain the  doctrine of extreme, subjective idealism, of absolute solipsism, even of absolute immediacy (where the world is re-created every moment anew, though strangely enough, in the shape deluding us to believe that it is the same world as the one a moment ago.) The logical possibility of such doctrines illustrates only what such a possibility is worth as a criterion of anything.  For any interpretation in terms of the \co{actual} knowledge, this \thi{finding} is impossible and untrue. In such terms a relation which assumes the being of one of its poles never counts as sufficient for the being of the other; in such terms nothing, nothing \thi{objective} has been {\em found}, only something has been thought, \thi{subjectively} posited. Thinking which knows nothing but its \co{actual concepts} is a sad affair and it indeed can not get further than such a denial. It can not recognise that this \thi{thought} of fullness beyond emptiness is not an \co{objective} thought of a possible state of affairs or an \co{actual} agent; that thinking it as a merely possible hypothesis is to deny it and think its opposite; that this thought would not be itself without being already a \co{trustful} admittance, \gre{pistis}; that it is impossible to approximate it, for in its simplicity, it can only be thought as \yes\ or not thought at all; that it is knowledge which, {recognising} \co{presence}, becomes \co{participation}, or simply, \co{participation} which {recognises} itself as such. But this knowledge, this \co{gnosis}, is not of the \co{actual} kind, it does not provide any \co{visible} justifications or reasons forcing one to accept it. If it did, the \co{choice} would not be a  free event. Only in the fact that it can be denied, in the complete lack of any reactive character, consists the absolute freedom of the \sch.\noo{ (and then of its consequences).}\ad{Good from evil}\label{pre:goodfromevil}% The lack of such reasons constitutes the aspect of free creation in the% \co{choice}.%The silent scream \wo{Release me!} fills the emptiness with~\ldots \co{nothing}.Yet, \co{nothingness} ceases to threaten with hollow darkness and void and,instead, becomes the source, the (new) \co{origin}. \co{Spiritual} \co{aspects}-- \co{humility}, \co{openness}, \co{thankfulness} -- turn the \co{indistinct  nothingness} into a warm and living friend, both remote and close.  Of course,it is still \co{nothingness}, there is nobody \thi{out there}, but the\co{indistinctness} started to live, and its life is fully consummated in the\co{spirit}, that is, \co{absolute} relation.

It acquires being which is no longer merelyontologically \co{founded} in the \co{one}, but which is \co{concretely founded}in it, which is \co{concrete participation}.  As such a transition from\co{nothing} to \thi{Something}, \yes\ is a new creation of the world, or whatamounts to the same, the \co{second birth}.  \No\ sees only emptiness, does not\co{distinguish} it \co{above distinctions}, and so it {\em is not}.  It isontologically \co{founded} in the same \co{origin}, but this \co{founding}remains as abstract and irrelevant as a mere fact, as any simply unavoidabletruth; it does not find a \co{concrete} counterpart in one's life.There is only one God, and everything is his \co{sign}. \thi{In itself} He is\co{nothing}, that is, everything. But although the  \co{presence} is obvious, it is not obvious that it is His \co{presence}, and sohe has two faces: \co{nothingness} can be all or nothing, he can be life ordeath, generous giver or sower of despair, peaceful love or fearful vengeance.

The unjustified -- and unjustifiable!? -- transition from \la{esse in  intellectu} to \la{esse in re}, raised as one of the earliest objections already by Anselm's contemporary Gaunilon, has the same content as the\thi{creation}, the \co{second birth} we were just speaking about. % even though Anselm treates this distinction carefully in second chapter of% \btit{Proslogion}.} The list of other objections of various kinds could be rather long: that\thi{being}/\thi{existing} is not a predicate which could be added to theconcept of anything, that \thi{being greater than} remains unspecified andcannot be given meaning making the argument work, that \thi{being greater than  which nothing can be thought} is not a legitimate concept and one should atleast show that it is not contradictory, that what is demonstrated is onlynecessity of a being provided that it exists and not its existence,that\ldots\ftnt{After the well-known criticisms by Gaunilon, Descartes, Leibniz,  Kant, Hegel, the discussion still continues.

We leave thepedantic analyses of the logical forms, merits and demerits of this beautifulargument to those who deem such exercises worthwhile.%\tsep{already there}\pa The argument intends not so much to {\em prove} God's existence as to confirmit, make it more transparent. Anselmrepeats Augustine's \la{credo ut intelligam} -- \citet{For I do not seek to  understand so that I may believe; but I believe so that I may  understand.}{Proslogion}{1.

But  all valid inferences are only tautologies, and all tautologies  are equally miserable.}%The argument \co{reflects} the \co{presence} of the \co{origin}.  It does nottell, in the manner of \la{a posteriori} \thi{proofs}, how finite understandingcould reach the infinite -- Anselm's dissatisfaction with his earlier proofsfrom \btit{Monologion}, his search for an \la{a priori} argument, can be seen asan expression of the fact that only such a structure reflects the underlyingpostulate that this has already happened, that understanding already is involvedin the infinite.\pa If nothing else, then at least the constant presence of the argument sincethe XII-th century, shows that \thi{being greater than which nothing can be  thought}, or perhaps only an idea(l) thereof, is highly troublesome for thepartial \la{ratio} with its pretensions to universality. The troublesome aspectis that knowing, which coincides with being, is \co{gnosis} and not plain\la{episteme}. \la{Episteme} can go no further than the \co{actual  dissociations}: the \citet{real object is one thing, and the understanding  itself, by which the object is grasped, is another,}{Gaunilon}{3} %a monk of Marmoutier, \btit{In behalf of the fool}, 3};%. An answer to the argument of Anselm%\btit{Liber pro insipiente} = \btit{In behalf of the fool}hence: the argument would be a valid proof {\em if}the idea of God in human mind {\em and} God's being were identical.  This identity,however, is impossible for \co{actual} thinking -- for it, \wo{being} means only\thi{real object}, \co{external objectivity}, completely \co{dissociated} fromthe \thi{human mind}, and as such the opposite of a \thi{mere idea in the mind}.This form of objection does not really consider the form of the argument at allbut merely points out the impossibility of proving that anything is: a proofis a thought, while thing is a being -- the two, once \co{dissociated}, can notbe the same by their very nature, \thi{by definition}. The argument has nothing to do with any thing which can be thought in the modeof such a \co{dissociation}. It does not apply to any \co{actual} things, and\citet{if anyone should discover for me something existing either in reality or  in the mind alone -- {\em except} \thi{that than which a greater cannot be    thought} -- to which the logic of my argument would apply, then I shall find  that Lost Island and give it, never more to be lost, to that  person.}{ReplyG}{3} But God who, without me, would only be impersonal Godhead,God about whom I should worry, in case I die, God who does not live somewhereelse, in a deistic \co{dissociation} from this world and human life but, on thecontrary, in its midst, who is hardly anything else than the \co{spiritual}tension of this life, the \co{absolute} pole of the \co{existential  confrontation} -- well, with such a God there is no difference between hisbeing and being \co{present}, between his being alive and being alive in me (orin you), or -- if one  insists on the inadequate mode of expression-- between his \thi{being in and for and by himself} and the \thi{idea of him in  one's mind}.Thinking it is not yet knowing it. For to know it\noo{ (and it is possible to\co{actually} know it)} is nothing else but to recognise this knowledge as one'sbeing, to recognise the relation of \co{confrontation} as \co{participation}.Anselm's argument appears as the recurring shibboleth of the ever recurringsuspicion: that knowledge becomes being which it already has been, that the\co{actual} understanding, the understanding of the \co{visible}, follows in the\co{invisible} \co{traces} of its \co{origin}, that the mere \co{totality} ofall things presupposes a \co{unity} from which it has arisen.  These, in turn,are only conceptual figures of the deepest possible transformation of humanbeing, in so far as man can contribute to such a transformation, of the creationof good from evil, transition from emptiness to fullness.\ftnt{It would be  tempting to draw here yet further analogy -- with the Socratic contention that  virtue is knowledge.% or even with the general Platonic identification of Goodness with Being.%As argued in \btit{Sophist}, d  Distinct virtues form a unity (a \nexus) in prudence, the knowledge of what is  truly good; and as knowledge can, according to Plato, concern only the  unchanging, the object of prudence, the true goodness is \co{absolute}, better  than which nothing could be thought. It would require a bit to overcome the  conceptual differences, but at least some of the basic intuitions would  probably turn out to be the same: the knowledge of the ultimate good is also  its being. (For the mere \gre{episteme}, this identification is as offending  as the one in Anselm's argument was to Gaunilo.) Even if we accept this  analogy, we should nevertheless observe the important difference which would  concern the opposite pole. The simple-minded negation might suggest that,  since virtue=knowledge, so evil=ignorance. But flat negations and  contradictions are of little use outside formal logic -- negation of  \co{gnosis} is non-\co{gnosis}, and this can be ignorance as well as adequate  \co{actual} understanding; negation of \co{participation} is  non-\co{participation}, and that can be intentional evil as well as despair or  a mere confusion. The resignation and surrender of the \co{spiritual} \No\   seem to have no counterpart in the Platonic evil as a mere mistake or  ignorance.  \wo{Evil, be thou my good} read with Plato could say, at most,  something like: \wo{I choose evil because I believe it to be good}. In our  reading it is rather: \wo{I choose evil because I am not able to choose good},  where \thi{not being able} can have the flavour of \thi{not knowing better}  but also of \thi{having not enough strength} and even of \thi{not willing}.}%, which repeats in human terms the \co{creation} \la{ex nihilo}.\newp \pa The disputes over the validity of the argument will hardly ever stop,because the possible interpretations will always not only reflect the availablerepository of concepts, but also mimic the assumptions, or rather the deep\co{motivations}, one had in advance.  It is of little value to argue\citet{[h]ow far the idea of a most perfect being, which a man may frame in his  mind, does or does not prove the existence of a God [...]  For in the  different make of men's tempers and application of their thoughts, some  arguments prevail more on one, and some on another, for the confirmation of  the same truth.}{LockUnd}{IV:10.7} Men may, of course, disagree not only withrespect to the validity of proofs and arguments concerning \thi{the same truth}but also with respect to this truth itself.  In the most abstract and extremeform, the poles of this disagreement \co{reflect} either \yes\ or \No, and thereare no \co{visible}, \co{objective} reasons allowing one to choose between them.\citet{The ontological argument is a report of experience}{IdealistView}{V:11}and reduces really to what one wants to understand by \wo{\la{aliquid, quo maius    cogitari non potest}}.  If one takes it to be what is intended, to be God,then one has already drawn the conclusion. For thinking God -- who is, and whois Being: \la{id, quod est esse} -- without thinking him as being (i.e.,\la{quod est}, not \la{esse}) is to think something else: either an emptyconcept, a mere word, or a non-empty concept which, by its very non-emptiness,can not be the concept of God.  Without any \co{existential} import, the mere\co{objective} thinking can not possibly think God.  \citet{For in one sense a  thing is thought when the word signifying it is thought; in another sense when  the very object which the thing is is understood.

For looking for it, one never finds. This is thetranquility of longing for nothing, the tranquility of hope fornothing, the tranquility of acceptance of everything -- the ultimate, the silence of eternity pregnant with time and all \co{visibility}.%a soul can achieve if it only grants it%to itself in all humility of trust and thankfulness.%hope\pa This longing expresses an infinite resignation, an irrecoverableloss without, however, yielding to it.  This loss is the ultimategift.  In the sudden silence of the night, in the darkness of thewaters, it finds a faint reflection of the last sun ray.  It resignswithout giving up, it admits defeat without surrendering.  For likethere is a great danger in every great victory, there is a great gainin every defeat.  The longing is but a hope -- not hope for somethingimpossible, but an impossible hope for something which already ishere, a hope for impossible fulfillment which, mysteriously, or evenmystically, already has taken place.  To admit the irresistiblestrength, in fact, the inaccessible and yet fully consummated realityin this longing, is to fulfill it.  Hope is a state where there are noexpectations, hoping {\em for something} is to have already lost allhope.  No visible sign will ever quench the soul's \co{thirst}.  Onlyseeing the impossibility of fulfillment, only appreciating theimpossibility of longing, makes you realize that no fulfillment isnecessary, that any fulfillment is a lie, like any success is adestruction of something.  Longing is but a sign of hope but this hope,in turn, is nothing else but its own goal.%acceptance\pa And thus, what emerges beyond the infinity of longing, beyond theimpossibility of hope, is quietude.  Beyond the horizon!  Beyond thehorizon!  Yes, but with time, we learn that beyond the horizon thereis next horizon, and beyond that, yet another one.  We can nevertranscend them all, which means, we can never transcend {\em the}horizon.  This is not resignation, only the gain one may collect froma defeat.  The presence of the horizon makes us realize that what iswithin may be worth at least as much as what is beyond.  And that whatis beyond is not so different from what has already been within.  Theacceptance is not the same as resignation, for resignation merelyadmits the defeat, while acceptance finds a precious treasureunderneath.  But you can not accept things within, you can not findthem worthy enough, unless you recognise the evanescent yet undeniablepresence of the horizon.  To accept things is to resign.  To negatethem, that is, to accept the horizon is, by an apparently paradoxicalcalculus of the soul, the same as to accept the things within, toconsent to them and their simple being within and to appreciate themas such.%quite & silent\pa And thus, what emerges in the infinite longing, in theimpossible hope is tranquility.  \ger{\"{U}ber Gebirge ist dieRuhe.} Longing abides in this tranquility and hope abides in it, too.} %%% end \noo{ to be REUSED%end of \subsub{The ontological argument}\subsub{Reflective Yes}\label{sub:reflYes}% (in abstracto)\paAs announced at the end of\refp{pa:twoFaces}, we now want to say a few words about things which are in ourpower and which may have some influence on the \sch. \Yes\ is not an \co{act}, it is an event happening \co{above} the horizon of\co{mineness}. It is not an \co{act} because \co{I} do not perform it and becauseit is not limited to the \hoa. It is an event in the sense that \co{I}\co{participate} in it, it affects not only \co{me} but \co{my} verybeing. \co{Participation} does not require even slightest \co{reflective} consciousness -- it is exactly something which\co{transcends} the \co{actuality} of a mere \thi{being a part of} or \thi{taking apart in}. \co{I participate} because \co{I am not the master}. If \co{I} were,\co{participation} would be impossible, for one does not \co{participate} inthings and actions one controls -- one executes or masters them.%; physical or mental presence has little to do with \co{participation}.But, on the other hand, one can agree (or disagree) with all that has been saidabove about the \co{choice}, one can \co{reflectively} consent or dissent,\co{reflectively} say \Yes\ or \No. As \co{my self} can be confused with\co{myself}, the transcendental ego with the empirical one, so here we have thepossibility of confusing the \sch\ with the \co{actual} one, the event with the\co{act}. The latter will \co{recognise} some \co{actual signs} of various\co{aspects} of the \sch.  A possible \co{reflective sign} of the \co{trust},for instance, might be the \co{actual} faith that it is indeed possible to exithell from which there is no exit, that suffering is not an evil revenge but a trialteaching one that evil can not possibly have the last word. But it might equallybe the absence of any such explicit faith which, however, still does not exclude the possibility of release.% This is no paradox, and if it appears to be one, one need not worry.

But who has not been in the vicinity?  \Yes\ doesnot require a descend to hell.  Moreover, although its reality, \co{grace},happens in the \co{invisible} depths, in the very \co{origin} of Being, we mayattempt a \co{reflective} description of some of its \co{aspects}.  Such\co{actual} expressions will constitute elements of the \co{reflective} \co{act}of the choice of \yes, of the \co{act}, or rather variety of \co{acts}, which itis in our power to perform and which may influence the \co{invisible choice}.The \co{choice} of \yes\ means to recognise \co{nothingness} as the\co{one}, the ultimate \co{invisibility} as the \co{origin}.In such a recognition, \co{I} admit several things. \noo{ To know only that it is \co{indistinct}, that is, \co{above} all  \co{distinctions} but, as opposed to \No, that this \co{indistinctness} is the  \co{origin} of all \co{distinctions} and not mere void and emptiness.    And only because it knows it, or if you prefer, because it is it, it can also  deny it, veil it by saying \No\ to the \co{confronting transcendence}.    and \co{that} this element can be a damnation or blessing. \co{That} is all.    \co{That} makes it also possible to still call knowledge, although it has only  remote relation to what is usually called by this name.

The \co{distinctions} among which\co{I} live, and some of which \co{I} actually can control, originate beyond thesphere of \co{visibility}. My understanding is limited to this latter sphere,but it does not embrace it, and it can only \co{vaguely}, and hardlyintentionally, \co{reflect} the workings of \co{invisibles}. \co{I} understand\co{myself} when \co{I} understand \co{my} limits, but the very fundamentalissue is first to recognise that such limits at all exist, that \co{I} end where\co{this world} ends, and that beyond there is something which, from theperspective of \co{this world} is but \co{nothingness}. \co{That I am not the  master} is to say that there is something more than \co{I} and \co{this  world}, that the \co{nothingness} beyond it is not emptiness, is not lack ofreality but, on the contrary, is the most real source of whatever is encounteredin \co{this world}.%All this amounts to \co{humility}.Eckhart asks \citeti{When does one stay humble? I answer: When you  apprehend One separated from others. And when does one step beyond humility? I  answer: When one apprehends everything in everything, then one steps beyond  humility.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Mistyka}{ A:IV.II.4.1.b)\kilde{p.58}}}The limits which are not to be overstepped are not any \co{visible} linesstretched around by some authoritarian ruler. They are limits of \co{visibility}as such, the \co{invisible} limits which are impossible to overstep anyway, and\co{humility} is simply an accepting recognition of this fact.\citet{Humility is that whereby we refrain from the desire for empty glory, sothat we don't desire to seem more than we are.}{AbelardPJC}{II:\para 291}\co{Humility} does not mean that \co{I} recognise any particular master whois governing \co{me} or \co{this world}. \co{Humility} in this \co{spiritual}form is not a submission to any definite power. Even more, it excludes such apower or, to the extent it experiences it, it transcends it.  Encounter with anyawe inspiring, ineffably powerful \la{tremendum sacrum} may easily lead tohumiliation rather than to \co{humility}. Humility which is a reaction toanything specific, which is caused by no matter how \co{vague}, but still aparticular cause or power, is perhaps an emotion, \citet{the sorrow produced bycontemplating our impotence or helplessness,}{SpinozaEthics}{III.On the originand nature of the emotions:Definitions of the emotions:26} but it is not atrue, \co{spiritual humility}. This latter is \co{humility} in the face of \co{nothingness}, one does not submit to anything,yet one {\em submits} -- only \co{that} makes it truly \co{spiritual}submission.  \citet{Let me be humble, that is,\kilde{one who} thirst for theorigin.}{HerbertPray}{}%\ad{Thankfulness. }\pa\label{thankfulnes} \co{Humility} faces the ultimate \co{gift} and amountssimply to its acceptance.  In this acceptance, \co{I} admit that \co{the world}in which \co{I} live is given to \co{me}, is the result of a process which mighthave involved \co{my self} but certainly not \co{myself}. The world, just like\co{grace}, is a generous --because unmerited -- \co{gift}. %,\refp{pre:thankful}.This does not mean that no single thing in \co{this world} is a result of \co{my  activity}, only that, eventually, all such things are grounded in the\co{transcendent} sphere of \co{invisibility}. \co{The world} is a \co{gift},\co{my life} is a \co{gift} and everything that \co{I} ever encounter is a\co{gift}. \co{I am} while there is no sufficient reason for \co{me} being here,\co{I am} while \co{I} might not be.  Recognition of \co{the world} and \co{my  life} as a \co{gift} of \co{transcendence} amounts to \co{thankfulness}.\co{Thankfulness} is but an expression of \co{humility} which admits that \co{I}have received and am grateful, unlike \citet{the miser [who] always fears  presents}{Haavamaal}{48} because they threaten his sense of independence andpower.It is essential for \co{spiritual thankfulness} that we recognisethe \co{gift} as arbitrary, as having no sufficient reason --\co{creation} is a mystery.  The recognition of the \co{one} as thegenerous source admits only that it is a necessary but not asufficient condition.  Any search for sufficient reasons, any attemptto explain the necessity of this \co{gift} amounts to explaining itaway and to renouncing the attitude of \co{thankfulness}.  Thearbitrariness of the \co{gift} is what \co{founds} the \co{spiritual thankfulness}. Its \co{spiritual} character means just that it is not thankfulness for anything specific; it is\co{thankfulness} for \co{nothing}, that is, for everything.  If onlyone starts looking for reasons for being thankful, for any positivethings worth gratitude, one renounces the \co{spiritual} dimension of\co{thankfulness}. (Which, of course, does not mean that one necessarilyopposes it.) %\ad{Openness. }\pa\label{openness} The arbitrariness of this \co{gift} means thatit might not have been given or else that it might have been entirelydifferent. Instead of \thi{this} \co{I} might have gotten \thi{that}, insteadof being \thi{this} \co{I} might have been \thi{that}.  No matter what, in \co{precise}, \co{visible} terms, \co{I} have obtained, does not change thenature of the \co{gift} and deserves the same \co{thankfulness}.  Anything that\co{I am} or encounter is but an instance of the fundamentalgenerosity.

For instance, \co{openness} amounts to \co{trust} as much asto \co{hope}, while \co{humble thankfulness} to fidelity.%To further such analyses , let us only summarise that \co{Love} is the \co{aspect} of \co{grace}, the first element \co{founded concretely}in the \co{spiritual} \Yes. Or putdifferently, \co{love} is \co{grace} in so far as it has \co{visiblemanifestations}, eventually even as it becomes \co{actually reflected}. % is \co{actually reflected} -- expressed and \co{manifested}, but also,% \co{reflected} over.\noo{In Book II we have made occasional references to love which, however, wasusually something different.  It was personal love, love at the level of\co{mineness}.  The two are not to be confused.  \co{Love} as \la{agape},\co{spiritual love} has no object, it is \co{love} of \co{nothing}, that is, ofeverything.  It is \co{spiritual} because it is the attitude towards the\co{origin} as \co{origin}, in its full, \co{indistinct invisibility}.  As such,it is not restricted to any particular region of Being but penetrates the wholeof it and is \co{present} in every encounter with any particular being.Personal love is, at best, only a restricted form of such \co{love}.}\subsubi{Works}\pa\label{pa:sameSame}% As the above references to the respective aspects of the \co{spiritual choice}% \refp{pre:openness}-\refp{pre:thankful} indicate, it may be hard to distinguish% the admissions of the \co{spiritual} \yes\ from those made in \co{reflective}% way.The difference between the \co{spiritual} and \co{reflective} \Yes\ concerns not so much the contents, as the place they occupy in the field of \co{existence}.If a \nexus\ \co{founds} particular forms of understanding or \co{acts}, thenachieving such a form of understanding or performing such \co{acts} will contributeto formation or strengthening of this very \nexus. \co{Grace} of the\co{spiritual} \yes\ is the relation of Being in the heart of \co{existence}, itembraces its whole being to its very depth, without leaving anything outside. Atthe same time, it may remain almost indifferent with respect to \co{actual}situations and moods -- indifferent, that is, unnoticed if one tries to captureit by the \co{actual} look. The contents of the \co{reflective} \yes, on theother hand, occupy \co{actuality} without, necessarily, witnessing to the\co{presence} of their \co{spiritual} counterparts. \co{I} can think as long as\co{I} wish about humility and thankfulness, without ever becoming \co{humble}and \co{thankful}. \co{I} can even perform a lot of humble \co{acts} which,however, do not make me \co{humble} (especially, if humility is my intention.)A closer relation between the two levels obtains when the \co{reflective} choiceis made genuinely, that is, \co{actually} tries to \co{reflect} the \co{aspects}like those listed above in its own attitude, when it does not deliberatethankfulness, but tries to find it, does not ask about humility, but tries tolive it; when the \co{aspects} of \co{love} cease to be any goals of particular\co{acts} and become constant \co{motives} and \co{inspirations} of one's whole\co{activity} and life.  The \co{actual} choice is not even a necessarycondition for the \co{spiritual} event of \yes, but it is certainly helpful,especially for \co{reflection} which has already been involved into the game of\co{invisibles} and which is in a sore need of \co{clarifying} it.  Eventually,the \co{spiritual choice} says only \yes\ to \co{nothingness}, and so does the\co{reflective} one. But \citet{[i]t requires an eminent reflection, or rather a  great faith, to sustain a reflection on nothing, which is to say infinite  reflection.}{Despair}{I:B [56]}\noo{There is, finally, yet another possibility, namely, that of the \co{reflective}choice \co{actually} \co{reflecting} the \co{spiritual} \Yes, when the \co{act}is \co{founded} in the prior \co{spiritual} \Yes.  We speak than of the\co{actuality} and the \co{actual signs} being \co{concretely founded}.The \co{invisibles} which are thus \co{present} in \co{concretely foundedactuality} are said to be \co{incarnated} -- \wo{\co{incarnation}} is theexpression for \co{concrete founding} viewed \thi{top down}. \co{Acts} and attitudes which help towards \sch\ of \yes\ are of the same kindas those which are \co{concretely founded} by this \co{choice}.  We will nowpresent in some more details the \co{concrete founding} arising from\yes. At the same time, it will provide examples of particulars which,remaining within \co{my} control, may help \co{me} towards \yes.}Works and even particular \co{acts} -- the elements of \co{reflective} attitude-- do contribute to the \co{invisible} sphere, and when performed in a rightattitude can contribute to \yes.  The general mechanism of such an influence isthe same as described in II:\ref{sub:lowHigh} -- although the \co{actual  experiences}, feelings, thoughts, \co{acts} do not influence directly thesphere of \co{invisibles}, yet they accumulate and pass gradually into the\co{virtual} depths of the soul. It is not so that \woo{in every good work the  just man sins,}{Luther, one of the theses condemned by Leo X} that\citet{every work they attempt is accursed,}{Calvin}{III:19.2.4} for good worksaccumulate and strengthen the goodness of the soul. But there are no obvious,causal or otherwise, connections, no guarantees nor any \co{precise} rulesdetermining the \co{virtual} effects of the \co{actual} works. Also, all\co{actual} elements are surrounded by the uncontrollable \co{rest} which, too,adds up to the result. The descriptions remain forever partial\ldotsFortunately, \citet{the gods have a care of anyone whose desire is to become  just and to be like God, as far as man can attain to the divine likeness by  the pursuit of virtue.}{PlatoRep}{613a:7.b.1\kilde{[Copleston I;p.218]}} \wo{As far  as man can\ldots} because actually attaining to this likeness, the \sch\ of\yes, is an \co{invisible} event. Its dependency on the \co{visible}sphere\noo{(just like the \co{actualities} passing into \co{virtuality},  II:\ref{sub:lowHigh})} may be claimed but never observed, may be concluded butnever proved. A \co{spiritual} event, when it comes, comes only and unmistakablyas a \co{gift}.\pa %\ad{As above, so below}\citet{The faith of man follows his nature.

Nothing is first; the fact that we can decide and attemptonly what is \co{actually} in our power, does not make the works either superiornor inferior to the faith. \citet{Faith without works is empty, works without  faith are blind.}{CrPR}{I:2.Introduction.1, A51/B75} Both follow the samecourse and neither is possible without the other.

It is clear  that \co{indistinct} is not affected by anything happening within the world,  among the \co{distinctions}. God's \thi{will} (if one wants to insist on such  a language) remains unchangeable: \co{actuality} remains ontologically  \co{founded} in the \co{one} and anybody willing to return is invited to and  promised the possibility. But God's appearance changes and it changes exactly  according to \co{my life}. It is \co{I} who live \yes\ or \No. Works help me  to do the one or the other and they are {\em the only} way in which \co{I} can  possibly help \co{myself}.

It happens within\begin{enumerate}\MyLPar\item the \hoa  %-- the part of \LL\ made actual;\end{enumerate}but it also has                   \begin{enumerate}\MyLPar \setcounter{enumi}{1}\item the horizon of \co{presence} -- the \co{rest}, the part of the \HH\ sphere which manifests itself in the \co{act}.\end{enumerate}It thus also has the respective limits\begin{enumerate}\MyLPar \setcounter{enumi}{2}\item an \co{object} - the intentional focus, the limit of \co{actuality}; and\item an \co{inspiration} -- the limit of \HH\ which is \co{present}.\end{enumerate}The \co{invisible} limit is, eventually, the \co{One} which is \co{present} only along with the cut through all the intermediary levels lying between it and the \co{actuality}. \pa The \co{presence} influenced by the \co{act} can never be itsintentional \co{object}.  To the extent \co{I} try to make it such, itwithdraws and changes its character.  In the most trivial cases, if\co{I} think \wo{I have to learn swimming.  I have to learnswimming\ldots} while trying to follow the instructions, \co{I} willhave very hard time.  The best \co{I} can do is to concentrate onfollowing the instructions.  If the intention of \co{my act} is\thi{to be good}, \co{I} may happen to do a good thing, but the\co{invisible aspect} of the \co{act} has then withdrawn beyond thehorizon of this intention and brought forth \co{presence} of somethingmore than what \co{I} intended.  (Probably, of what motivated \co{me}in the first place to try \thi{to be good}.)  It is not that \co{I} amnot conscious of what, eventually, hides behind my \co{acts} -- it isthat \co{I} {\em can not possibly} make it consciously \co{actual}, inany case not in the \co{act} itself nor in the context from which the\co{act} emerges.}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\noo{\pa Acts of withdrawal, patience, humility (\?{humiliation}) will make\HH\ present.\paA single act in itself may mean many different things -- it becomessignifying only in the context of its totality, i.e., its \?{inspiration}.(cf.~\refp{anymisunderstood})\pa We may misunderstand an act if we do not know the context ofactivity, an activity if we do not know the life of the person, andthe life of a person if we do not know the absolute values which itembodied.  \pa Often, we have to know the horizon to understand the act.  Withoutknowing a person, we will sometimes misunderstand or not understandwhat he is doing.

Does not \sch\ amount to a projection?  Do we not say that the \co{indistinct} and unknowable \co{one} has to be endowedwith the qualities of the source, goodness, power and what not?  The answer isno, and if you see this, you may safely skip this section.Indeed, there \citet{can be no greater incongruity than [for a disciple of  Spencer] to proclaim with one breath that the substance of things is  unknowable, and with the next that the thought of it should inspire us with  awe, reverence, and a willingness to add our co-operative push in the  direction toward which its manifestations seem to be  drifting.}{Pragm}{I;p.19}\noo{ The \sch\ does not call for any awe,  reverence, or any willingness to add this or that to this or that. It does not  call for any attitude -- it helps create it. The \co{actual} attitude will in  any case be determined also by \co{my} character, \co{my} intelligence,  \co{my} physiology, by all \co{visible} and hardly \co{visible}, conscious and  unconscious aspects of \co{my} being. In \co{precise} terms, the \co{choice}  does nothing and the \co{love} merely adds a gentle touch, an \co{invisible    rest}, which is as important, deep and decisive as it may seem  insignificant.  } There might be an incongruity in suggesting that the\thi{unknowable} should inspire one to anything. But we have neither anything\thi{unknowable} nor call for any inspiration by something. The \co{indistinct}is unknowable only if knowledge means the \co{actual} \la{episteme}, knowledgeof \thi{whats}. But we do have full knowledge of it, we know all that is to knowabout it, if not in this narrow sense, then in the sense of \co{gnosis} -- it is\co{indistinct}, \co{one above distinctions}. As to the inspiration then,indeed, it is only to silence. But silence can be a calm voice of eternity or amute emptiness. It does not inspire: it leaves you completely free to make yourchoice.  This choice, the \sch\ is a thoroughly real {choice} between the onlytwo alternatives offered -- not by the \thi{unknowable} but by the \co{absolute}which, in its \co{indistinctness}, remains indeed indifferent. Only we areaffected, and we are affected by \co{confronting} the face of \co{one} whichcorresponds to our \co{choice}.  What we have done with, or rather {\em out of}the concept of \co{indistinct} in Book I, can be taken as a mere illustration ofthe grounds which might incline one towards seeing it as the true \co{origin},towards accepting it as truth, that is, towards saying \yes. There is, however,no necessity, no sufficient reasons which might force one to make this, ratherthan the opposite choice. If there were any, then it would not be any choice.% But the \co{choice} itself is thoroughly real, it is a choice between two real% alternatives.\pa We should carefully distinguish the \co{choice} from mere psychologicaleffects.  According to James, \citet{to find religion is only one out of many  ways of reaching unity [\ldots] In judging of the religious types of  regeneration [\ldots] it is important to recognise that they are only one  species of a genus that contains other types as well.  For example, the new  birth may be away from religion into incredulity; or it may be from moral  scrupulosity into freedom and license; or it may be produced by the irruption  into the individual's life of some new stimulus or passion, such as love,  ambition, cupidity, revenge, or patriotic devotion.  In all these instances we  have precisely {\em the same psychological form} of event, -- a firmness,  stability, and equilibrium succeeding a period of storm and stress and  inconsistency.}{Varieties}{VIII\kilde{p.176}}One can form hierarchies of genera and species as one finds appropriate but ifthese have \thi{the same psychological form} (which here probably meanssomething like {psychologically indistinguishable}, even if contentuallydifferent), then thank you very much for the psychological contribution --\la{pneuma} is \co{above} \la{psyche} and here our ways part definitely withpsychology.  Indeed, having only \co{actual experiences} of a \thi{subjective}psyche as the basis of distinctions, all such states may happen to end up in thesame sack.  Yet, even James does not include these later instances in histreatment of the religious experience.  So, after all, they are distinguishable?The sense of purpose, of direction and goal, of mission, or else of finding avaluable sphere of \co{experience} may indeed, especially if taken as absolute,give firmness and stability.  All \co{idols} can, and many minor matters can.\co{Idols} are seldom entirely false -- they gain followers exactly because theycontain an element of truth.  But the \co{unity} \co{founded} by the \sch\ isnot derived from any sense of goal, direction or mission -- the goal is\co{nothing}, the direction is \thi{anywhere}, and the mission is\citet{\co{love}, and do what you wilt.}{AugustJohn}{VII:8}\noo{As much as we  owe to pragmatism when applied to the \co{visible} phenomena, here our ways  part definitely also with its ways.}  \noo{\citet{Love, and do what you wilt:    whether thou hold thy peace, through love hold thy peace; whether thou cry    out, through love cry out; whether thou correct, through love correct;    whether thou spare, through love do thou spare: let the root of love be    within, of this root can nothing spring but what is    good.}{AugustJohn}{VII:8} }\co{One} can \co{manifest} itself in innumerable ways which may bepsychologically as different as trembling and adoration, as fear and attraction.These differences can often be found behind different \co{visible} characters ofvarious religions.\co{An experience} of God's presence will almost inevitably have tremendousinfluence on one's life, and the form of this influence may depend heavily onthe character of the experience.  But it is not its character, its content whichaccounts for its influence -- it is the lack thereof, \co{expressed} as thetremendous force, \la{majestas}.  Psychologically distinguishable content playsits part but what is constitutive for such \co{an experience} is what thiscontent reveals -- the ultimate, \co{absolute} force which groans into one'sface without showing its own.  It is the {\em intensity} of such \co{an  experience}, its irresistible power, which is its essential content, not theform under which this content appears.  And this power is \co{objectless} andcontentless, it has no agent, it is the power of \co{nothingness}, but it {\em  is}. There is, consequently, nothing to be projected, there is only somethingto be \co{recognised} -- in the most mundane sense, \co{that I am not the  master}.\pa \Sch\ is not a matter of \co{any experience} just like religiosity is neverreducible to \co{any experiences} which, perhaps (though even this \thi{perhaps}seems too much), may be psychologically indistinguishable from a sudden attackof fear on a neurotic (or even a healthy) person, or from a sense of ecstaticjoy which recurrently visits an infantile or {senile} one. It happens in ameeting with the \co{absolute nothingness} which involves {\em full and active  participation} of the invaded.  \Sch\ can take place long after the actualexperience and also when no such experience ever found place.A meeting with \co{absolute} \thi{objectivity} does not require any specificcontext or experience, even if specific experiences play usually(psychologically) some role of motivating factors.  Such experiences arepossible \co{actualisations}, as Otto says, \thi{schematisations} of the \la{a  priori} ground of all \co{experience}.  To the extent the \co{presence} of\la{numinosum} is recognised \co{beyond} their content, they themselves are\la{a priori} -- irreducible to any \co{visible experiences} or categories,concepts or feelings, but grounded in the ultimate \co{invisibility}.%The fact that \co{absolute} may (in fact, always does) invade only oneperson and not another is such an argument for its \thi{subjectivity}as it would be against the objectivity of Japan that some people werethere while others were not.  That it is unverifiable?  %Excuse me! What is?  %We have read Popper, have we not?% \ftnt{Quite a clear statement of the basic idea of falsificationism can be%   actually found in \citeauthor*{Fruth}, II:21.}It is as unverifiable as the accusation of its being a \thi{subjective  projection} is self-confirming.  For as long as one insists on such acharacterisation, one is simply unable to get any meaning whatsoever of itsnature and value.  But \citet{\la{a priori} recognitions are not the ones which  everybody has but ones which everybody {\em may} have.}{Heilige}{XXII\kilde{p.195}  (\wo{Recognition} translates here the word \wo{\ger{Erkenntnis}}; my emph.)}\pa Simply: whatever meets one in any situation, comes from beyond the horizon-- not only the \hoa\ but, eventually, the horizon of distinguishability.Certainly, many things are expected and predictable but they, too, enter not onone's command but on their own -- one can at best help them, never force them.And they, too, eventually emerge from beyond the horizon of the distinguishedcontents, from the \co{indistinct}. \co{Reflective} \yes\ is hardly much morethan that, than the admission \co{that you are not the master}, that\co{indistinct} is and remains \co{indistinct}, albeit, remaining so is also thesource of \co{distinctions}. In particular, it is exactly the attitude of {\em  not projecting anything} beyond the horizon of distinguishability, but merelyadmitting its constant \co{presence}. It is, on the contrary, any other attitudewhich amounts to a projection: either projection of emptiness, as in the case ofdefinite \No, or a projection of some \co{idol}, as for instance the \co{idol}of \co{actuality} in the case of \co{objectivistic illusion}. \yes\ admits onlythat, in the face of \co{nothingness}, any requirement or expectation ofsomething specific, of something \co{visible} is \co{idolatry} grown from\co{thirst} which, in the face of \co{nothingness experienced} as emptiness, is amplified to angst. \citet{The soul or mind reaching   towards the formless finds itself incompetent to grasp where nothing bounds it  or to take impression where the impinging reality is diffuse; in sheer dread  of holding to nothingness, it slips away.

It does not choose any specific content which it might try  (or has wished) to project \thi{outside} of its \thi{subjectivity}.  \yes\ chooses only silence,the \co{confrontation} with \co{nothingness} (and \No\ exchanges this \co{confrontation} into words, concepts and, eventually, emptiness). \citetib{If the  mind reels before something thus alien to all we know,   we must take our stand on the things of this realm and strive thence to see.  But, in the looking, beware of throwing outward; this Principle does not lie  away somewhere leaving the rest void; to those of power to reach, it is  present; to the inapt, absent.}{Plotinus}{VI:9.7}It is \thi{throwing outward} which amounts to projections, to either emptying\co{nothingness} and reducing it to a void, or else to populating it with finite\co{idols}.  As it happens, the choice of \yes\ has tremendous consequences, butthese are consequences, not projections.\noo{ %not needed projections    \pa Consequently, neither the genuine \co{analogues} are any kind of  projections.  They are certainly not any psychological tricks played by  subconsciousness on one \thi{who does not know what he is {\em really}    speaking about}.  Such a critique \fre{\'{a} la} Feuerbach applies to the  uncritical use of \co{analogues}, the use which \co{posits} some indefinite  \co{object}, a projection of \co{reflective} understanding, and endows it with  some attributes.  But when used in the genuine sense, they are  \co{reflections} of the underlying \co{experience}, of the \co{incarnation} of  \co{love} -- they are \co{expressions}.  Since this \co{experience}, once it  comes, confronts \co{me} with the ultimate \co{transcendence} and its  \co{gift}, there is no way of seeing it as a mere projection of human, all too  \thi{subjective}, psyche, unless one is unable to renounce the absolutism and  narrowness of the distinction \thi{subjective}-\thi{objective}.  Saying that  \wo{God is but a projection of myself} is to conflate completely \co{myself},  \co{my self} and \co{self}, and to confuse the \co{transcendence} of the  latter met in the \co{experience} of the former.\ftnt{Instead of    \wo{projection}, one might perhaps find another word for the unity of    \co{spiritual aspects} as applied to soul or world.  Irenaeus, relates views    of gnostic provenance, according to which the passions and \gre{enthymesis}    (inborn idea) of Sophia are materialised and turned into substance.    \citef{For her enthymesis having been taken away from her, along with its      supervening passion, she herself certainly remained within the Pleroma;      but her enthymesis, with its passion, was separated from her by Horos,      fenced off, and expelled from that circle. This enthymesis was, no doubt,      a spiritual substance, possessing some of the natural tendencies of an      Aeon, but at the same time shapeless and without form, because it had      received nothing. [\ldots] who would not expend all that he possessed, if      only he might learn in return, that from her tears of the \gre{enthymesis}      of the Aeon involved in passion, seas, and fountains, and rivers, and      every liquid substance derived its origin; that light burst forth from her      smile; and that from her perplexity and consternation the corporeal      elements of the world had their formation?}{Irenaeus}{I:2.4/4.3\kilde{in        Roberts and Donaldson, Ante-Nicene Fathers, vol.  I, [Creation of        Consciousness, p.72]}} But who will want to see behind such a mere    \thi{projection} a {\em genuine} process of \ger{Beseelung},    \thi{ensoulment}?  If one thinks that projections are something discovered    only in XXth century, one might consult again Gnostics and neo-Platonists,    with their \gre{probol\'{e}}, which usually translated as \thi{emanation},    may be equally well rendered as \thi{projection}.\kilde{Creation of      Consciousness, p.76} }    \pa As said in \refpp{GodheadGod}, the \co{analogues} are only reflections of  the respective aspects of the underlying attitudes of \yes\ or \No.  But the  word \wo{\co{analogue}} does not mean that these are some artificial  constructions.  They are, in fact, the possible qualities of \co{experiences},  and the tendencies, as well as one's attitude, can be \co{experienced}  precisely through such \co{analogues}.    \pa If one experiences world, life, things, the indefinite everything as  fullness, as good, as powerfully meaningful, one has perhaps not said \yes,  but one has a good chance to do so.  Such \co{experience}, or such qualities  of some \co{experiences}, are ways of \co{presence} of \co{invisibles} even if  the \co{act} of \sch\ has not taken place.  \co{An experience} \co{that it is}  can be embraced by an aura of intense beauty and wonderful mystery, even if  the \co{actual object} has no such qualities.  (Does any object {\em have}?)  Such \co{experiences} are \co{gifts} of the \co{origin}, \co{gifts} of  \co{presence} which need no active or volitional participation on our part.  But also the \co{acts}, the \co{acts} of gratitude, benevolence, compassion,  generosity, friendship, etc., which presuppose the \co{open} attitude at least  toward the \co{actually} concerned object, situation or person, will result in  a definite and \co{clear} \co{experience} of \co{participation} in something  which is not limited to the boundaries of \co{mineness}.    \pa In other situations, one may experience everything as basically void and  meaningless, or, perhaps, simply as coldly indifferent.  \co{An experience}  \co{that it is} may present one with a ridiculously meaningless \thi{this},  dissociated from any context, an offense to any sense of purpose and meaning.  It may be filled with disgust and nausea, so thoroughly studied by Sartre and  other epigons of existentialism.  Such \co{experiences}, too, are \co{gifts}  of \co{presence}, perhaps, reflecting the hidden currents of \co{invisible}  \No, perhaps, signaling the stage of purgatory transition.  Taking such  \co{experiences}, or such qualities of \co{experiences}, as the definite and  last word about the world, one will look for reasons, explanations, excuses,  eventually indeed \thi{projecting} them on the world and its essential nature.    Experiences of this kind hurt to the bottom of one's soul which tries  desperately to escape them.  Projections, trying to \thi{explain} and  \thi{justify}, that is, bring release by re-establishing unity, by making me  and the world friends again, paradoxically have the opposite effect -- they  only \thi{objectify} the painful contents of the \co{experience}.  The  \thi{objective} reasons may be innumerable -- it may be some \co{recognised}  mischieves, some petty or important evils, eventually, the vicious, because  indifferent, emptiness of the world in general.  If I would agree on calling  them \wo{projections}, it is because they, genuine and \co{actually    experienced} as they are, do not \co{express} the ultimate end and have to  substitute for it \thi{the nature}, \thi{the world} or whatever they choose as  that which \thi{actually and objectively is out there}.  Indeed, the  \co{choice} of \No, \co{attached} to the distinctions of \co{mine} vs.  \co{not-mine}, \co{subjective} vs.  \co{objective}, seems bound to the  language of \wo{projections} (in addition to the common \thi{receptions},  i.e., all forms of world's influence on \co{me}), because even in its luckier  and more happy forms, it still can not avoid blurring these distinctions, it  still can not distinguish \co{precisely} between world and \co{my world},  between \co{my world} and \co{my life}.    \pa Whether of the positive or negative character, such \co{experiences} of  the indefinable \thi{totality}, the \co{experiences} which seem to announce  the deepest essence of all things, accompany our life.  And they do it not  only as occasional \co{actual experiences} but also as \co{qualities} of  \co{our life} which happen to be also \co{qualities} of \co{this world}.  As  long as they are not referred back to the \co{spiritual} \co{origin}, they are  most \co{clearly experienced} only through the \hoa; first, as the indefinable  \co{rest} of \co{acts} and situations and then, when we \co{reflect} over  them, as qualities, as properties of something.    \pa Conversely, the \sch\ will found \co{experiences} reflecting the attitude  towards the \co{origin}, \yes\ will found \co{actual experiences} of fullness  and goodness, while \No\ of meaningless, perhaps even evil, emptiness.    As long as \co{I} remain centered on the sphere of \co{visibility}, \co{I} do  not see that \co{experiences} of totality of the world and life are only  \co{analogues} of \co{my} attitude because, as a matter of fact, \co{I} have  not as yet assumed any attitude.  They are scattered pieces which come and go  as they like.  \co{I} might have heard some \co{vague} \co{calls}, might have  had some \co{vague intuitions}, might have had some particular  \co{experiences}, but these have not been solidified.  As long as the \sch\ has  not been made, such \co{experiences} will easily shift from one extreme to  another.  \citeti{Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the    devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should    believe and be saved.  [\ldots] these have no root, which for a while    believe, and in time of temptation fall away.}{Lk.}{VIII:12-13}%} % end \noo %not needed projections\pa Both wheat and chaff, both \yes\ and \No\ tendencies \citeti{grow together  until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers,  Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but  gather the wheat into my barn.}{Mt.}{XIII:30; Lk.  III:17} Unlike any choicebased on some definite, particular \co{experiences}, on thoughts or feelings,the \sch\ is \co{absolute}, not relative to any particular being or region ofBeing.  Now, every choice suspends, at least to some extent, the relevance ofthe subsequent feelings and thoughts; as an \co{act} of \co{my will} it simplysays: \wo{I choose this, no matter what might come}. But every choice related toparticular aspects of \co{experience}, every choice motivated by and based onsuch particulars, will also continue being involved in them.  Eventually,changes in their configuration can render sticking to the original choice thematter of pure dogmatism, inflexibility, stubbornness. Every \co{actual} choiceis an \co{externalisation}, a projection of its \co{actual} decision into thefuture. Every \co{act} and \co{action} is a projection -- as Heidegger wouldsay, a \wo{project} -- saying \wo{I want this thing to be {\em so}}.The \co{reflective aspect} of the \sch\ is an \co{act} and thus, in a somewhatsimilar way, it too \co{externalises} its content.  But this\co{externalisation} does not result in any \co{dissociated object}, in anyparticular goal, nor in any quality ascribed to something which, subsequently,might turn out not to possess it.  It is the \co{act} of recognition of ultimate\co{transcendence}, say, the ultimate \thi{objectivity}, which is not dependenton the form or quality of any possible and \co{actual experiences}.  Throughthis \co{act} \co{reflection} only admits this \co{presence} and, by the sametoken, the insufficiency of its own modus.  It recovers the constant, underlyingall \co{experiences} \co{presence}, which it always knows, if only dimly,through \co{self-awareness}, that is, \co{awareness} of the \co{transcendence}.The truth of this \co{act}, its conformance to the \co{origin}, is thus lifted\co{above} and lasting beyond and independently from \co{this world}. \citeti{Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I  will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the  rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that  house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.}{Mt.}{VII:24-25/Lk.  VI:47-48}\pa The \sch\ of \yes\ does not require any feelings or impressions, does notinvolve any specific thoughts or contents which might be projected.  It is aresponse to the \co{command} of \co{nothingness} to become \co{self},\co{reflection} of the \co{origin}.  It leaves all feelings and thoughts, all\co{visible} \co{signs} and particulars \co{below}, centering around theessentially \co{invisible}, the \co{origin} which now becomes also the axis ofone's world.  \citet{The person is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into  the sea and drew it up from the sea full of little fish.  Among them the wise  fisherman discovered a fine large fish.  He threw all the little fish back  into the sea, and easily chose the large fish.\noo{Anyone here with two good    ears had better listen!}}{Thomas}{8}This \co{choice} is \co{absolute} also in the sense that it effects the finaldivision, the definite separation of \wo{wheat from chaff} which until now havebeen mixed together. It takes the spell of \co{closedness} from \co{this world}and \co{opens} it to the \co{inspiration} from \co{above}.  But this happensonly through the \co{absolute} renunciation of \co{this world} -- anypretensions on its part to \co{absolute} validity and importance, to theultimate and all-determining \thi{objectivity}, are removed.  \noo{{Think not  that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.  For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter  against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.  And a  man's foes shall be they of his own household.}{Mt.}{X:34-36}}The \co{absolute} character of the \co{choice} amounts, in short, to the lack ofany particular contents which possibly could be projected.  Responding to the\co{command} to renounce \co{oneself}, it is the \co{choice} of the attitudewhich transforms the world: not in any of its temporal and \co{visible} aspects,but in its \co{absolute foundation} -- it transforms the character of the whole\co{existence}.  If somebody wants to call this \wo{projection}, it is of coursehis choice, although such a choice amounts to much more than it believes to bedoing.\subsection{Concrete founding}\label{sub:concrete}\pa In Book I, we had only to do with ontological \co{founding:} there would beno \co{experiences} without \co{experience}, there would be no \co{experience}without the \co{chaos} of \co{distinctions}, and there would be no\co{distinctions} without something to \co{distinguish}, or as it may be, to\co{distinguish} from.%In Book II we saw, in the reverse order, its \thi{epistemological} counterpart:from the \co{immediacy} of \co{reflection} to the \co{actually reflected  experiences}, from \co{experiences} to the \co{experience} and to the\co{awareness} of its \co{invisible} background, from \co{chaos} to theunderlying \co{non-actuality} of \co{invisibles} and, eventually, to the\co{existential confrontation} with the \co{indistinct one}.\noo{In Book II we  saw, in a reverse order, its epistemological counterpart: there would be no  \co{reflection} without the \co{experience} to \co{reflect}, there would be no  \co{experience} without the \co{awareness}, and there would be no \co{chaos}  without the underlying \co{non-actuality} of \co{invisibles}, eventually,  without the \co{existential confrontation} with the \co{indistinct One}.  }The two hierarchies are, in fact, the same and differ only by the emphasis oneputs either on the element of \co{participation} or relation, being or knowing;the difference of emphasis which is possible when viewing the same hierarchyeither, so to speak, \thi{bottom up}, from the assumed primacy of the\co{dissociated} contents, or else \thi{top down}, in the order of\co{founding}.This \co{founding} is, as abstract ontology or epistemology in general, perhapscuriously interesting but existentially, at best only helpful and, at worst,irrelevant -- it happens and works according to its structure, no matter what wedo, and even if its understanding may reward \co{my} curiosity, it does notreally affect \co{me}.  We have several times observed that events at differentlevels may happen relatively independently from those at other levels because,in \co{concrete} terms, the ontological \co{founding} is not effective.  Itmerely gives a general form and character to each level, which form andcharacter are conveyed to the character of the contents at the respective level.But events of one level remain related to this level merely as \thi{matter} to\thi{form}, and they remain relatively unrelated to the events of other levels.Eventually, they lack anchoring in their \co{origin}, they lack the \co{concrete  foundation}.  Thus, although the hierarchy does proceed from the \co{unity} ofthe \co{one}, it is not \co{experienced} as such in \co{concrete} terms.  Inparticular, \co{reflective acts} remain \co{dissociated} from their \co{origin}which, in \co{actual} terms, means from each other.  The intimations of\co{unity}, \co{clearly} known as they may be at the deeper layers of\thi{knowing}, always slip out of the \co{precise} \co{reflective} graspand dissolve in \co{vagueness}.If $X$ \co{founds} $Y$ then $Y$ \co{participates} in $X$: both these\thi{relations} (which are one and the same) may also have, in addition to theuniversal and ontological form, the \co{concrete} one.% The \co{concrete participation} is not merely \co{founded} -- in the% abstract, indifferent sense -- in the order of Being, but is \co{founded%   concretely}.\co{Concrete foundation} does not \co{found} \co{experience} in general, but aparticular way of \co{experiencing}, a \co{concrete experience} that theparticular things and \co{distinctions} of the lower levels originate fromthose at the higher levels.  \co{Concreteness} is not, as the common confusionand language usage suggest, \co{immediate precision}. The table in front of me,the more \co{precisely} it is perceived and identified, becomes only the moreabstract, because, the more \co{dissociated}. \co{Concreteness} is theexperiential continuity between the contents of \co{actual experiences} andtheir \co{foundation}, eventually, their \co{origin}.  \co{Concrete} is onlythat which carries the \co{traces} of anchoring in the ultimate personal site,and the lack of such \co{traces} amounts to abstractness, that is, indifference.\noo{ Lower, smaller, more \co{precise} and \co{actual} things get embraced by  the \co{unity} -- not the \co{totality} -- of the underlying \yes.  The result  is a state -- not, however, of body or mind, not of consciousness or feelings,  but a \co{spiritual} state of thorough \co{participation}. This state  \co{manifests} itself, down to the lowest levels of \co{actuality} and  \co{immediacy}, through a gradual separation of the elements which,  \co{virtually}, still remain the same\ldots This manifestation, however, is  not an \thi{objective announcement} encountered on the way to work. It is the  same as discovering \co{traces} behind the most \co{actual signs}, and  following these \co{traces} towards their \co{origin}.  }Unlike the ontological \co{founding}, the \co{concrete} one is not somethingthat simply \thi{is that way}, that simply is granted by the hidden butuniversal order of things which one must only discover and accept.

Man is a borderline between what is \co{below}and what is \co{above}, and \co{visible} is just another side of the\co{invisible}.  Any attitude towards the one is, at the same time, an attitudetowards the other. The \co{spiritual} \yes\ to the \co{invisible nothingness},accepting everything, \co{founds} also some \co{actual} attitude in the\co{visible world}. Just like \citet{holiness is never the mere \la{numinosum},  even at its highest level, but is something which is always in a perfect way  permeated and saturated with rational, purposeful, personal and ethical  elements,}{Heilige}{XV\kilde{p.131}} so \co{actuality} is not merely the siteof closed, \co{dissociated} \co{immanence}, but the eventual \co{sign} of the\co{origin}, the meeting point of the \co{traces} of the \co{invisibles}, theeventual place of \co{incarnation}.  When the \co{actuality} is \co{reflection}of nothing less but the \co{origin}, when the \co{traces} reach all the way tothe \co{origin}, in short, when the \co{visible} and \co{invisible} spheres areno longer \co{dissociated}, the just quoted words of Blake seem only to echo, inthe reversed order, those of Plotinus: \citet{The loveliness that is in the  sense-realm is an index of the nobleness of the Intellectual sphere,  displaying its power and its goodness alike: and all things are for ever  linked.}{Plotinus}{IV:8:6.\noo{(We would, of course, substitute for  \wo{sense-realm} and \wo{Intellectual sphere} our expressions.

(\thi{Being entitled}, often\thi{entitled to one's own opinion}, and even \thi{entitled to be heard} arequite common forms.) At the bottom it is to make an \co{idol} of \co{mineness},is to think that something \co{visible} is worth cherishing an opinion about,and that one is entitled to cherishing such an opinion.  Cherishing anopinion, one cherishes \co{oneself}.Again, all this does not mean that one can not mean anything about anything.One not only can -- one is bound to.  One will have opinions about things, willparticipate in arrangements of things, in research, in work, in all kinds ofactivities of \co{this world}. Moreover, one will accept all these things asone's part, as relative, yet \co{absolutely} real, though not as \co{absolute}reality.  But in the moment one starts cherishing them, one becomes\co{attached}, that is, starts worshiping \co{idols}.\pa \co{Idols} are what \thi{possesses} man, \thi{being possessed}consisting in making the relative into the \thi{absolute}.% This is by its very nature unconscious which justifies the phrase \wo{being% possessed}.Even if one has all the good reasons for adhering unreservedlyto a given opinion, one's being possessed by it consists in the {\em  unreservedness}, in the perhaps unintended but, therefore, the stronger andmore effective turning it into an \thi{absolute}.Rationalism, defined as the acceptance of any \co{actual} statement or positionwith the recognition of its limited validity (and in the best case, also of itsactual limits), is the opposite of being possessed.  In this respect, itcoincides with innocence which is just that -- being pure, that is, not beingpossessed.  But every \thi{-ism} indicates a possibility of being possessed,\thi{absolutisation} of some relative sphere or expression.  One's intense anddeeply convinced materialism or idealism, atheism or theism, liberalism ordogmatism, Protestantism or Catholicism, intellectualism, existentialism or whatnot, testifies against one's innocence.  One can become possessed even byrationalism itself which, \co{unfounded} and \co{dissociated} in its \co{proud}complacency, tends towards agnosticism, relativism, scepticism or just dryrigidity.%\subsubnonr{Obedience} %{renouncing idols = renouncing self}\ad{Obedience} Giving up \co{idols} does not mean merely to replace the\thi{object} of such a worship, to exchange the relative for the absolute, butstill retain one's attitude.  \thi{What} is being worshiped determines the\co{visible} aspects of the attitude.  Worship of patriotism {\em is} differentfrom worship of communism, worship of scientism {\em is} different from worshipof money.  Yet, they are the same in so far as \co{idolatry} is concerned.  Tocease worshiping \co{idols} is to recognise their thoroughly relative character,relative not only to each other and to particular circumstances, but also to the\co{foundation} from which they emerge; eventually, it is simply to recognisethe \co{absolute} character of the \co{one} which is unconditionally \co{above}the world of \co{distinctions}. Giving up \co{idols} is, at bottom, giving up\co{oneself}, for reduction of \co{self} to \co{myself}, the sphere of\co{visibility}, is \equi\ with \co{attachment}. And \co{attachment} is thepattern of all \co{idolatry}. All \co{idols} are things which, being \co{below  my self}, are not noble enough to possess \co{me}.\citet{Behold, in such a man must all thought of Self, all self-seeking,self-will, and what cometh thereof, be utterly lost and surrendered andgiven over to God, except in so far as they are necessary to make up aperson.}{TheolGerm}{XLIII} The crucial \co{aspect} of \co{non-attachment} liesnot in any grandiose opening to the \co{above} and ascetic self-denial, but inthe small reservation \wo{except in so far\ldots}. One does not deny\co{visibility}, one only renounces the image of its absoluteness, for \thi{in  so far} as it is necessary \co{aspect} of life, its denial is not verydifferent from \co{pride}. \pa Another expression for this is \wo{\co{obedience}} which, however, does notmean submission to any specific agent, even less to any specific commands. It is\co{obedience} to \co{nothing}, that is, to everything.  \co{Obedience} is justanother way of saying \co{that I am not the master} and, on the other hand, thatI am \co{thankful}. These two -- not any servile submission, lack of autonomy,sense of inferiority -- exhaust the sense of \co{spiritual obedience}. It is notany conflict of the wills in which one must yield to the other, for only we,limited human subjects, have any will.  If it is a conflict, then only of \co{my  will} with \co{nothingness} which \citeti{is poor, naked and empty as though  it were not; it has not, wills not, wants not, works not, gets  not.}{Eckhart}{} \co{Obedience}, or as one often used to say, \wo{obedience to  the Divine Will}, means only that one ceases to insist on one's will, that oneceases to insist on \co{oneself}.  \wo{Do not strive to seek after the true,  only cease to cherish opinions.}  \co{Ego} is the site of \co{idols} whichdisturb more than one is ever able to realize, opinions which are one's own (andtrue!), images which drive one's will in all possible, often pleasant,directions. \co{Obedience} means only (only?) that one lets them go, one maystill use them, but one ceases worshiping them.  \co{I am not the master} and \co{I} am \co{obedient} -- eventually, this meansthat \co{I} am \co{nothing}; not having any master and being \co{obedient} to\co{nothing}, \co{nothing} becomes \co{my} whole treasure, \co{nothing} becomesmine.  \co{Nothing} is mine, not only things but also the \sch\ is not \co{mine}-- it happens \co{above me}; even \co{thirst} is not \co{mine} -- it was onlygiven to \co{me} as a \co{gift} of remembrance.%(Th.Germ. X [end of 1st paragr.]) + Aquinas (choice is not mine either)\co{Nothing} is all you have, is \co{your} only treasure, and \citeti{where  your treasure is, there  will your heart be also.}{Mt.}{VI:21; Lk. XII:34}\pa\label{pa:filling} We react against \thi{obedience} which berefts us of our\thi{autonomy}, just like we think that emptiness is when nobody speaks.  Butemptiness is when nobody listens, and {\em the whole} \co{obedience} is tolisten to the silence, not to any specific orders. It is to accept that \co{I  am not the master}, not finding another one nor even barely looking forone. \co{Nothing} is the master and \co{obedience} is but \co{openness} to its \co{gifts}, free\co{thankfulness} lifted \co{above} all particular gifts, as opposed to the freerejection which loses all its autonomy to the degree it insists on it.Eventually, \co{nothingness} listens -- it has heard the scream \wo{Release me!}But then we do not have to speak any more. Silence is the ultimatecommunication, \co{communion} which also teaches us that genuine response ismore than any \co{visible sign}, any \co{actual} word.  Insistence on the {\em  right} to say one's meaning and to be heard is \co{attachment} to images,\co{disobedience}. Silence is a moment of \co{eternity} in time -- nowhere andnever happens more than in such a moment. This \wo{mute country}$^{{\rm    II}:\ref{cit:mute}}$ is our constant companion, and it scares only the manbound by worship of images.%Who understands that has read enough.%We are created to listen, not to speak, and to listen to silence%%%%%%% Obedience is freedom, only to nothing...%%%%%%\subsubnonr{Spiritual unity}\ad{Spiritual unity} \Yes\ says that, in the ultimate matters, the \co{visible}impossibility does not count. In this sense it renounces \co{this world},renounces its pretensions to \co{absolute} validity.  Renouncing all\co{visibility} leaves only \co{nothingness}, the place where everything canappear anew. But it is no longer a place divided into \co{this world} and\co{another world}. \co{Incarnated spirit} is the \co{unity} of -- not only aborderline between -- the \co{visible} and \co{invisible}.% Renouncing all of \co{this world}, clarifies the other, \co{above} is only% \co{nothingness}, and so In what does this \co{unity} consists, \co{concretely}? \co{Concretely}, in\co{nothing} particular.  \citet{Damn the flesh that depends on the soul. Damn  the soul that depends on the flesh.}{Thomas}{112. \citef{Hate and lust for    things of nature have their roots in man's lower nature. Let him not fall    under their power: they are the two enemies in his path.}{Bhagavad}{III:34}}The \co{spiritual} unity of {soul} and {body}, of {higher} and {lower}, modifiesbut does not change man's existential situation.  Man is a borderline betweenwhat is \co{below} and what is \co{above} -- \co{visible} is just the other sideof \co{invisible}. The \co{unity} consists in being \co{concretely founded} inthe \co{origin} and being \co{open} to the \co{aspect} of \co{gift} in every\co{actual} situation, in \co{experiencing} flesh as the \co{gift} of\co{spirit} and \co{spirit} as the \co{concrete foundation} of flesh. In \co{unity}, this \wo{and} does not join two different \co{experiences} butexpresses their \equin.\newp\pa Consequently, the \co{unity} consists also in the fact that \co{spirit} isdirected towards \co{nothing}. This means simply directedness towards what is\co{visible}, for \citeti{there is nothing better, than that a man should  rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to  see what shall be after him?}{Eccl.}{III:22. Although we will not confuse such  remarks with the Stoic endurance -- which is a matter of resignation and  surrender to the world overgoing one's powers, not of \co{thankfulness} for  its \co{gift} -- we may nevertheless notice affinity of expression: \citef{We    must make the best use that we can of the things which are in our power, and    use the rest according to their nature. What is their nature then? As God    may please.}{Epictet}{I.1}} Or, we might add, to {\em see} what is\co{above} him? This directedness towards the world is no longer {\em  exclusive}, as it was with the \co{attachment} and \co{active} evil. On thecontrary, it reflects now only the recognition \co{that I am not the master} andconcentration on \co{visible} things which \co{I} can influence and evencontrol. For, \co{actually}, no direct, intentional attitude towards the \co{origin} isneeded, if at all possible.  Such an attitude is already an indication of amistake -- the \co{one} can not be made correlate of our intentions or\co{acts}, unless it is reduced to some \co{objective} from.% \co{analogues} can be \co{experienced} but they are not -- or in any case,% should not be turned into -- independent entities.Intentional \co{acts} find place only in the sphere of \co{visible} contents,\co{distinctions} which are sharp enough to be turned into the \co{objects} of\co{action} or \co{reflection}.  An \co{act} aiming at and consciously intending\thi{goodness} is not good.  It need not be evil, nor wicked, nor malicious; itmay be thoroughly well-intended but it is not good. The intention of \thi{being  good} pollutes every \co{act} unless it is withdrawn from the sphere of\co{actuality}, unless it has become an \co{invisible} but \co{present rest}.This applies to all higher things which one might possibly \co{posit} as one'sintentions, even goals.  An \co{act} whose main goal is {\em to be}compassionate, is not compassionate, just like an \co{act} intending only toprove and show one's freedom is not free.  A person focused on making always\thi{right} decisions may, indeed, happen to make them \thi{right}. But he willspend time in constant worry about doing just that. And since \thi{right} isentirely \co{vague} category, one will never rest. A person focused on hissalvation may happen to do a lot of good things, but his focus will alwaysdisturb him: \wo{Has it already happened or not yet?  {\em How} can I be  certain?}The higher, \co{invisible} things are not any intentions, they do not in any wayenter into \co{my} considerations. Salvation, being good, etc. emerges, as itwere, only as a side-effect of \co{acts} which themselves are occupied only withtheir \co{actual} \co{objects} and \co{visible} relations. But having thuswithdrawn from the sphere of \co{visible} intentions, they do not disappear as\co{attachment} to \co{visibility} would claim. They remain \co{present}although -- and because -- they are no longer sought among \co{actual} givens,because they are no longer conflated with their \co{visible signs}. % A person focused on morality may, indeed, happen to perform a lot of good% \co{acts} and \co{actions}, but his focus will always ask in the background:% \wo{Is it morally perfect?}, and if not, then \wo{Is it moral enough?}% The reality of \sch, the \co{incarnated love}, is witnessed by its% \co{manifestations} in our \co{experiences} of \co{visible world} and in our% dealings with it.  \co{Non-attachment} comprises the \co{qualities} which are,% so to say, on the edge of the sphere of \co{visibility}.  They reside in the% \co{rest} of \co{acts}, as \co{inspirations}, \co{motivations}, \co{vague} hopes% and \wo{desires to become just and be like God}...  But as everything else, they% may be \co{posited} as correlates of \co{my} intentions, goals of \co{my acts},% turned into kind of \co{objects}.  Such a reduction amounts simply to losing% them.\pa\label{pa:forget} \co{Spirit}, the objectless relation to \co{nothingness},is purity and poorness. It does not aim at the spiritual, does not seek it and,hence, does not pollute it with the \co{visible} images.  This is the only wayof its \co{concrete presence}.  \citeti{Blessed are the poor in  spirit.}{Mt.}{V:3; Lk. VI:20} Walking the spiritual paths may be anexpression of a genuine spiritual \co{thirst} -- but this only means, theabsence of \co{spirit}.  \citeti{Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my  footsteps slip not.}{Ps.}{XVII:5} Any strife, any search, whether spiritual ornot, expresses only some lack. The more spiritual such a search is, the more it circlesaround the \co{vague} and indefinable \co{that} and the less it is satisfiedwith any \thi{what}.  But spiritual search is not \co{spirit} because it cannotavoid replacing \co{spirit} by some \co{visible}, if only \co{vaguely}imaginable, intention.  \co{Spirit} either is, either is thoroughly,\co{concretely} and \co{absolutely present}, or it is not at all, is only someunidentifiable and ever missing \co{rest}, which one may desperately try toreplace by some \co{visible} substitutes or, as the case may be, by theinsatiability of \co{more} which never manages to quench the \co{thirst}.\co{Spirit} is first of all \co{humility} towards the {spiritual}, towardsthe \co{invisible origin}.%used later\citt{Know what is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you%will be disclosed to you.  For there is nothing hidden that will not%be revealed.}{The Gospel of Thomas, 5}By this very token, it directs its attention towards \co{this world}, because\co{this world} is no longer \co{dissociated} from \co{another}, of which \co{I  am not the master}.  If we view the ontological \co{founding} from Book I asthe descent of which mystics and philosophers of the neo-Platonic orientationspoke, while its lived and understood \co{reflection} in the levels of Beingfrom Book II as the corresponding ascent, then the \co{incarnated love} marksthe final and definite return.\ftnt{This seems to be the natural way to  interpret much of the mystical ascent though, of course, there are other  possibilities.  Hermes Trismegistus is probably one of the clearest examples  emphasizing this element of return -- not to some sphere \co{above} but to  \co{this world}: \wo{as below so above} but also \wo{as above so below}.}  Itdoes not end in a momentaneous illumination, in an ecstatic contemplation, inany \co{actual experience} of mystical union with a constant wish for itsrepetition.  It does not live in \co{another world}, but it does not have todescent into \co{this world} either -- there is only one world, and\co{actuality} becomes the scene of constant, \co{concrete presence}.%%% used earlier  \citt{there is nothing better, than that a%%man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion.}{Eccl. %% III:22 }The \co{origin} is no longer remote and separate -- \co{spiritual love} isnothing else than the attitude towards the \co{visible world}. \co{This world}is not {\em only} an imperfect \co{sign} of the \co{other world} -- it is {\em the only}\co{sign}, the only form of \co{invisible presence}.\co{Spirit}'s directedness towards \co{nothing} means that it \co{rests} withthe mere \co{that}. As there is nothing more to do about\co{nothingness} than saying \co{that} it is, \co{spirit} is the \co{restful}return to \co{this world}. To \co{rest} is to accept the \co{invisible rest} --to give up all the attempts at making it \co{visible} -- and in this sense, to\co{forget} it.%\thesis{\co{Spirit} is \co{forgetfulness} of the spiritual.\ftnt{You may notice that the  verb \wo{\co{rest}} here (and the noun \wo{\co{rest}} as \thi{tranquility})  is, obviously, something different from the noun \wo{\co{rest}} as  \thi{reminder} which we have been using earlier. The homonymy, however,  serves us perfectly because the equivocation is thoroughly intentional. To  \co{rest} is to admit, to allow for, to accept the \co{rest}.}  %}%\subsubnonr{Forgetful remembrance}\ad{Forgetful remembrance} Thus, \co{spirit} is the renouncement of \co{thisworld} and \co{forgetfulness} of the spiritual. Indeed, \co{nothing} is left.As soon as something more \co{precise} gets involved, a distinct thought, aspecific feeling, the \co{spirit} seems to evaporate, to lose \co{actuality}giving place to the flesh -- perhaps, to \co{myself}, perhaps, to \co{my}\co{ego} and {body}.  But \co{I} live only in the world of \co{distinctions}and this withdrawal is \co{spirit}'s only true \co{presence} -- it\co{incarnates} only when the attempts to \co{actualise} it have ceased.  Being \co{invisible}, it can never become \co{actual},but it can be \co{present} around and \co{above actuality} which means, in the very midst of it.  If you look to the left, you won't find it, if youlook to the right, you won't find it, if you look forward or backward, in pastor in future, you won't find it.  Because, when you look for it, you havealready found it, you only have to stop looking. It \citet{\noo{[The kingdom]}will notcome by watching for it.  It will not be said, 'Look, here!'  or 'Look, there!'Rather, the Father's kingdom is spread out upon the earth, and people don't seeit.}{Thomas}{113} But \thi{to stop looking for it} is as difficultas it sounds easy.There is a great difference, which may appear as a paradox, between\co{forgetfulness} and forgetfulness or, perhaps, between \co{forgetfulness} anddenial. \co{Forgetfulness} of the spiritual is the deepest remembrance of\co{nothingness} -- remembrance, however, not in the form of a constant,\co{actual} remembering, of incessant focus on the desired, even if impossible,\co{actuality} of the spiritual.\ftnt{This is the source of bad conscience, not  yet in any moral sense, but in the spiritual sense which, transcending the  notion of personal guilt, inflicts only the deeper sense of corruption; the  bad conscience of Luther or Faust or Mann, so characteristic for the Germanic  mind and almost unknown to the English ratio-empiricism or French enlightened  aestheticism.} It is remembrance which, for the first, remembers only\co{nothing}, only \co{that} it is, but does not worry constantly about\thi{what} it is; and, for the second, remembrance which itself is not\co{actual} but thoroughly \co{invisible}, which does not enter the sphere of\co{actual} considerations and intentions and does not try to bring the\co{invisible rest} into explicit \co{actuality} of \herenow.  It is\co{forgetfulness} as far as the \co{actual} occupations of the \co{subject} areconcerned, for these deal only with \co{visible} things. But as far as \co{my}being is concerned, it is the remembrance which \co{I} have become, the\co{self} which is no longer overshadowed by \co{my self}, not to mention, by\co{myself}. \co{Actual forgetfulness} is the \co{eternal} remembrance.\pa By its very nakedness and \co{nothingness}, \co{spirit} grants\co{actuality} all the validity it possesses as the only place of our \co{acts}and works.  But to find this place, one has to lose it first.  \co{I} can nothave anything which \co{I} have not already lost.  Ibsen says, \citeti{Only the  lost is eternally owned,}{\btit{Brand}}{IV:last scene.\kilde{Evig eies kun det    tapte} \citefi{Whoever abandons things as they are accidental possesses them    as they are pure being and eternal}{Eckhart}{\btit{German Sermons} Si.L:10;    Ac.I:4. in \citeauthor*{Eckhart}{ 16b;29.\kilde{p.275,289}}} } but one mightsense here some literal and resentful meaning of loss.  Bitterness, \co{closing}one's world in the ever narrower circle of disappointment, is a frequentcompanion of \co{attachment} unable to live the \co{actual} loss.  But\thi{having lost} precedes any \co{actual} loss and amounts rather to suspendingits validity without, however, negating it completely. \thi{Having lost} is morelike a joy over a minute thing which as if suspends the validity of the wholeworld. Its focal point is the \co{actual} joyful thing but it does not close the\co{experience} within this \herenow. It rather opens it up -- not for all thethings in the vicinity, not for all the \co{visible} things, but for the\co{rest}, the indefinite yet \co{clear} joy, inflow of its rays.  Losing somedear thing or person can likewise effect such an opening by pointing in thedirection \co{above} where some \co{rest} always survives any \co{actual} loss.It is not so much the lost thing which becomes eternalised, it is only the\co{eternal} element which announces its \co{presence} underneath the lostthings. \citeti{When the heart weeps for what it has lost, the spirit laughs for  what it has found.}{Anonymous Sufi aphorism}{\citaft{Huxley}{p.106}} Unlessthe loss is complete, before the whole world has been lost, every \co{actual}loss is like a painful indication of the possible ultimate loss, a reminder ofthe possibility of losing \co{this} whole \co{world}.\noo{If \co{eternity}  enters through the loss of the \co{visible} so, once it arrives, it permeates  all \co{actuality}...}  And if one has not lost \co{this} whole \co{world}, ifone stays \co{attached} to it, one is not able to fully and deeply enjoy anyparticular thing, whose fragility keeps only reminding about the impermanence ofthe world.To have some particular thing is to have already lost it, to agree that it isnot \co{mine}, that \co{I} do not control it. Only then can \co{I} truly haveit.\noo{We have here obviously abandoned Marcel's distinction between  \thi{being} and \thi{having}.}  Having already lost it is simply to admit itsfragility, which only makes the appreciation greater.  Expectation of itspossible loss may certainly cause some worry.  If, and when, one \co{actually}loses it, this may naturally cause sorrow and pain.  \co{Spirit} does notabolish such negative moods, thoughts, feelings. On the contrary, it \co{opens}one for their thorough and deep experience. This happens because such worriesand sorrows are as real as they are relative, and although they affect one,they do not affect the tranquil \co{unity} of the \co{spirit}.We are not saying that \co{spiritual unity} is a tranquilizer, a placebo againstfinite failures and \co{actual} dissatisfactions. \co{Spirit}, directed towards\co{nothingness}, is fully directed towards such finite and \co{visible} thingsand events, it does not supersede them. It only makes one worry for the thingsof \co{this world} without worrying about the ultimate things, without lookingfor the \co{absolute} in the \co{visible}, that is, without establishing\co{idols}.%It makes one care for all finite things because, having \co{founded} one's beingin the only \co{absolute} of \co{nothingness}, it allows one to recognise their\co{eternal foundation} and, at the same time, to accept their fragility. Athing which one could not {\em possibly} lose (if it existed) would be, or inany case would turn with time \ldots worthless. Eternal life, imagined vulgarlyas temporal infinity, would be, if not unbearable, then eventually boring. Andboredom would not come from the fact that there were no new things to encounter.It would come exactly from the fact that there would be nothing else toencounter than mere novelties.  Death is the complete return to\co{indistinctness}. And it is the knowledge of this ultimate \co{nothingness},of the fragility of all \co{visibility}, which makes life so valuable. However,life occupied {\em exclusively} with the maintenance of itself, forgetting\co{that}, i.e., that there is something more worthy than it, perhaps evensomething for which it could be sacrificed, becomes a mere social, even a merebiological phenomenon -- deindividualised, impersonal, eventually, contentless.Although it is hardly possible to live fully such an idea, it is quite possibleto \co{actually} believe it.\pa Eventually, only \co{visible} things of \co{this world} are given to us, sothat we can \citeti{have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of  the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping  thing that creepeth upon the earth.}{Gen.}{I:26} But reducing Being, and whatthen follows, one's own being, to such things only, \co{dissociating} them fromtheir \co{origin} (as is typically the case in the attempts to see,\co{re-cognise} and admit the value which they do possess), turns them into deadand empty \co{objects}. It makes us forget so that we do not remember.\co{Forgetfulness}, too, directs one towards \co{visible} things but not as theonly and \co{absolute} form of Being.  \co{Forgetfulness} makes one rememberthat all \co{visible} things are only \co{signs}, but also that they are {\em  the only}, true and real, \co{signs} of the \co{invisible}.  \citet{Know what  is in front of your face, and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to  you.}{Thomas}{5.  {Bluntly put, \co{spirit} is the true life of the flesh, but    it lives {\em only} in and through the flesh.

All thishas nothing to do with the \co{spirit}, even if the \co{externally visible}results may be exactly the same. For \co{external} results, as we know, do notcount for us as much, and do not give us as deep a satisfaction, as we oftenwould like to believe. They may be necessary but are never sufficient.  But wecan also care for things and do good works because \co{spirit} does notdistinguish that from the ultimate \co{humility} -- in fact, because it does notleave us anything else to do.  Care for finite things, work carried out withconscientiousness, respect and \co{humility}, do keep heaven and earth together.Work -- hard, tiring, exhaustive work -- which has engaged fully body and mind,makes \co{me forget}. \co{Forgetfulness} finds the \co{expression} as respectfor \thi{the order of things}. At the same time, it is the deepest form ofremembrance, \co{forgetfulness} of \co{spirit}.  Sloth is a cardinal sin becausethere is no such thing as \thi{pure spirit}, disembodied, non-incarnated, notinvolved into \co{actual} goals and works. There is only living, \co{concrete  spirit}, which unfolds itself in the body, in \co{this world}.  Dedication andthoroughness, hard work and conscientiousness are not, in any case, notnecessarily, signs of \co{attachment}. More often than not, they are signs of\co{spirit}. And as all \co{acts} which are \co{expressions} of \co{spirit},they also strengthen it or, as is often the case, prepare for it.\citeti{Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be  established.}{Prov.}{XVI:3}To be sure, \co{concrete presence} of \co{spirit} is nothing common. Perhaps, itis even very rare, though it seems that it is less rare than we want to admit orare able to realize.  But the fact that no statistical investigation may evergive a slightest indication of it means only that it is the most real, that is,the most individual and personal possibility -- unrepeatable, not because ofvarying \co{visible} conditions but because thoroughly \co{concrete}; and alwaysthe same, because consummated in the same existential situation, in the face of\co{one nothingness}.%Statistics can never say anything about anything individual.\subsub{Inversions}\label{pa:inversion}Before giving some examples of \co{concrete founding}, let us observe somegeneral mechanism making occasionally \co{manifestations} of higher thingsappear in a strangely inverted manner.%Let's give a few more concrete examples of the \co{aspects} of%\co{non-attachment}.\pa\label{pa:allaspects} \co{Love} has unlimited number and forms of\co{incarnation} which are always purely personal. \co{Love} is a \co{virtual}\nexus\ which opens unlimited field of possible \co{manifestations}.\citeti{Temperance is love surrendering itself wholly to Him who is its object;  courage is love bearing all things gladly for the sake of Him who is its  object; justice is love serving only Him who is its object, and therefore  rightly ruling; prudence is love making wise distinctions between what hinders  and what helps itself.}{St.~Augustine}{\citaft{Huxley}{ V\kilde{ p.92}}}%Furthermore, every \co{concrete manifestation} of \co{love}, although it mayseem to express only one or few of its \co{aspects}, is always a full expressionof all of them. For \nexus\ can not be divided and \co{present} only partially;only its \co{aspects} can possibly exclude each other from the \co{actuality}which they fill, leaving no place for others.  Say, modesty may seem a naturalexample of \co{humility}, but it involves equally \co{thankfulness} and\co{openness}. Modesty is not a servile admission of one's inferiority. It is ahumble gratefulness which does not argue about the qualities and conditions ofthe \co{gift} -- one's own achievements and labor being, too, \citet{nothing  more than the finding and collecting of God's gifts.}{Luther}{45;p.327  \citaft{LutherTheol}{ II:10.1\kilde{p.109}}} And it is grateful for everythingit obtains, for a person who is now modest and now not, is simply notmodest but only behaves modestly in some situations.\pa Now, all the \co{aspects} of \co{love} are predicated adequately about the\co{spiritual} attitude, and only analogically about anything within the\co{visible world}. Together with the \co{unity} of all the \co{aspects} inevery expression of \co{spiritual love}, this can give raise to apparent\co{inversions}. Roughly, \co{inversion} is a \co{manifestation} throughsomething which appears as the opposite of the manifested. This happensespecially when judged by \No\ which does not recognise anything beyond the\co{visible} categories of merely human, or even only \co{egotic}, level.% It is only appearance, usually a misreading of the situation, which \co{inverts}% its meaning.\co{Inversions} originate in the most general schema of \co{nothingness} being(the \co{origin} of) everything, which is also reflected in the fact that theapparent renunciation of \co{myself} and \co{this world} in \co{non-attachment}amounts truly to the genuine return to the world.  \co{Thirst} is a \co{sign} ofgenuine \co{presence}, \co{spirit} is \co{forgetfulness} of thespiritual.  %\refp{pa:forget}.The apparent lack may be the true \co{manifestation}, albeitin an \co{inverted} form.  On the other hand, the total absence of \co{spirit}is, too, its total forgetfulness. On the surface the two extremes may beindistinguishable, for what separates \co{forgetfulness} from forgetfulness,\co{presence} from absence, is an \co{invisibly} thin line. With respect tothe \co{spirit}, such lines are the most crucial boundaries and only\co{attachment} to \co{visibility} will view their expressions as paradoxeswhich often permeate the language of \co{spirit}. \pa Modesty is to do everything one can. This is all, but we may also add: andknowing that one can not do more.  Waiting resigned for a miraculous gift fromheaven has nothing to do with modesty; perhaps with laziness or sloth.  Modestysees even its own achievements as \co{gifts}, only ones which it can, to someextent, influence.  An achievement is an \co{inverted} form of a \co{gift}.Modesty works with full dedication, it employs all the abilities and potentialfor achievement of its goals. It confronts the task and makes \co{me} disappearin the process of this confrontation -- \co{I} am still there but, in a sense,only for the sake of the task. Modesty is this disappearance of \co{myself}.Only having done everything, only meeting the limits, one becomes modest. Andwhen one has done everything one could, one also knows it -- for knowing thatone can not do more {\em is the same as} having done everything one could. Theaddition of \thi{knowing that...}  does not add anything; it only seduces us tothink of \thi{knowing} merely as explicit, \co{actual} and fully \co{reflective}knowing.  (It even seduces us to think that what we said may be self-satisfiedand detached \wo{I am done with it ('cos I can't do anything else).} Modesty isnever done with anything, for it knows that no matter what it has done, morecould be done, only that it can not do that.)A person trying actively to accomplish some task may spend a lot of time andeffort in this direction.  He may become a highly skilled expert with very highprofessional standards.  From outside, and seen only in abstract terms, it maylook like he is only craving for reputation, recognition or just forprofessional achievements of which he could be proud. Although often this may bethe case, it certainly does not have to be.% \ftnt{I believe that Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein and many other great%   scientists and artists might provide examples but the issue would require more%   personal acquaintance than I could claim.}Modesty depends on one's capacities and standards one applies to{\em oneself} -- if these are exceptionally high, others will rather seeambition and pride.  But the person may -- thoughonly may -- be full of \co{openness} and modesty, and what is (typically, in theimpersonal sphere of gossip, rumours and newspapers) judged ascraving and striving may be but dedication, energy and \ldots true \co{humility}.In short, what appears as arrogance may, in fact, be \co{thankfulness}; whatappears as preoccupation with one's little world may, in fact, be \co{openness};what appears as pride may be \co{humility}.  Likewise with the opposite, wenever know \citet{under which tempting and affection-rising forms lie can, in  spite of everything, penetrate to the deepest layers of [] spiritual  honesty.}{ProustRuskin}{\noo{p.57}{\co{Inversion} is not a mere confusion. It    is common that, for instance, \citef{vices shew themselves off as virtues,      so that niggardliness would fain appear as frugality, extravagance as      liberality, cruelty as righteous zeal, laxity as      loving-kindness.}{GregoryEpist}{Book I:XXV. To John, Bishop of      Constantinople, and the Other Patriarchs [Also, \btit{The Book of Pastoral        Rule...} II:9]} \co{Inversions} can indeed give rise to    misunderstandings, but it is their inherent feature that what is    \co{manifested} appears \co{actually} as its opposite. They are more    adequately described by St.~Augustine: \citef{A father beats a boy, and a      boy-stealer caresses. If thou name the two things, blows and caresses, who      would not choose the caresses, and decline the blows? If thou mark the      persons, it is charity that beats, iniquity that caresses. See what we are      insisting upon; that the deeds of men are only discerned by the root of      charity. For many things may be done that have a good appearance, and yet      proceed not from the root of charity.

Often precipitate action      is taken for the efficacy of promptness, and tardiness for the      deliberation of seriousness.}{St.Gregory the Great}{The Book of Pastoral      Rule of Saint Gregory the Great Roman Pontiff to John, Bishop of the City      of Ravenna, Part II:IX} }} One does wisely suspending the judgment of anaccidental situation with respect to such deeper matters -- not because they donot make any difference, but because \co{invisible distinctions} \co{manifest}themselves only indirectly, and often in an \co{inverted} form, through the\co{actual} ones.\ad{Humility -- pride} \citet{But if there were one in hell who should get quit  of his self-will and call nothing his own, he would come out of hell into  heaven.}{TheolGerm}{LI} \Sch\ is recognising \co{myself} as \co{nothingness},admitting not only that \co{I am not the master} but that, in fact, \co{I am  nothing}.

One can even attempt to construe \co{love} and \co{humility} borderingon holiness as simple egoism, exclusive preoccupation with one's own self andone's own salvation -- for \citet{that love occupies the highest place in the  hierarchy of egoisms does not change the fact that it is  egoistic.}{ProustRuskin}{\noo{p.70}}%perhaps even as arrogant and self-centered pride.However, calling holiness of love for \wo{egoism} is to deny it. Holiness doesappear as something higher and, perhaps, distant but, at the same time, it isnever absolute \thi{otherness} separated from us by an impassable distance. Onthe contrary, it always embraces everything around itself as if telling toeverybody: that art thou, too. But not hearing this silent voice, one will thinkthe distance to be infinite, and see detachment instead of \co{presence}.  The\co{humility} of \co{non-attachment} brings one, indeed, \co{above this world}-- not, however, in any sense of despising \co{this world}, of contempt forhuman weaknesses and vanity of all things, but only in the sense of notaccepting anything \co{visible} as \co{absolute}. \co{Humility} is \co{founded}in the face of \co{nothingness} -- it is humble in the face of \co{visible}things because they are its \co{gifts} and \co{nothingness} penetrates theirwhole \co{actuality}. Thus, its \co{actual manifestations} can indeed be felt asa proud challenge. They need not bear the appearance of obvious humility,inferiority and self-depreciation of an ascetic or only Franciscanflavor.\ftnt{For instance, it took St.~Bonaventure, \la{doctor subtilis} John  Duns Scotus, \la{venerabilis inceptor} Ockham and few other Friars Minor to  overcome the view, inherited after St.~Francis', which contemned knowledge for  being a sign of pride.}  Just like the ambiguous modesty mentioned above,\co{humility} may appear, in the eyes of the world, as its exact \co{inversion}:instead of \co{non-attachment}, one can see detachment, instead of \co{humility}-- pride raised \thi{above this world}.%\pa%Love, obedience, faith, charity, humility, thankfulness -- all these%are synonyms! Do not try -- do not even try -- to separate them.\ad{Passivity -- alertness}\label{pa:actpass} \co{Openness} \co{founds concrete  presence}, in fact, omnipresence of God in all situations which,\co{visible} and limited to the \hoa\ as they are, emerge from the \co{invisible  origin}.%The respect for things and people is but the%\co{presence} of \co{openness}, an \co{expression} of God's \co{omnipresence}.Every meeting, with a person, with a situation, with a problem, is a \co{gift};sometimes, a challenge, sometimes, but a pleasant confirmation, sometimes aplain disaster.  No matter what the specific character of this meeting, \co{I}should be \co{thankful} for it because, at the bottom of it, the very fact ofbeing able to meet something deserves deepest \co{gratitude}, and because everysuch meeting is also a meeting with the \co{origin}.This \co{thankfulness}, however, does not mean that \co{I} am to fall flat andthank God for bestowing on me yet another disastrous gift.  The \co{spiritual}passivity is only to stop cherishing opinions, to stop \co{idolizing}\co{oneself}. It is not to stop discriminating.  Being annoyed, beingdispleased, being disgusted are impressions and feelings one need not get rid of-- they are feelings of human saints as much as of human wretches.  To bethankful for particulars is to stop absolutising them, to meet them with all therespect they deserve as \co{signs} of the \co{origin}, and then to try to placethem on the right shelf in \thi{the order of things}.\noo{If one wonders what  this phrase could mean, then I can not say -- I do not know! A person who  pretends to know it -- in general -- is confused, perhaps, even dangerous. It  is probably close to Homer's \citef{chain of gold}{Iliad}{e.g., VIII:18-27},  or to \thi{the true value of things} in Lucilius' statement: \wo{Virtue is to    be able to render the true value to the things among which we move and in    which we live.}\citaft{SisterI}{ XII:17;p.226.}}%And if \co{I} have no clue where something belongs, then it can stay where itis, at least for the time being.  Valuing things we also value our life and\co{express} our \co{gratitude}.  The alertness and presence of mind is just thesteady preparedness to meet things with such an attitude.  It is \co{founded} inthe \co{transcendent openness}, but it concerns all the \co{immanent},particular things. The \co{spiritual thankfulness} might seem to imply passiveacceptance of everything but, as a matter of fact, it is the opposite ofslothful passivity or mere aesthetism -- it \co{founds} active and vigilantattitude to all \co{actual} situations.\ad{Humility -- strength}\label{pa:humbleStrong}Strength isn't much more than such an \co{open} alertness. It is not strength ofwill, it is not strength of abilities but just that -- strength, preparedness tomeet everything with equal tranquility and \co{openness}, to face things and beready to handle them or, as the case may be, to be defeated by them.One is strong when one has learnt that it isimpossible to lose, no matter what defeat one might suffer. This secure determination equals its meek \co{openness}. Strength has nothing todo with hardness, with the defensive, self-protective shell one can, often withingenious inventiveness, rise as if in an anticipation of a threatening danger.Hardness is but an extreme case of false security which spends years ondesigning schemes and laws of things making everything fit neatly here andthere, on the right or on the wrong side, and which, eventually, realizes thatthe whole scheme was but a construction; security which, in the most unexpectedmoment, in the moment of the utmost surety and complacency, is suddenlysurprised, and that means defeated, to the bottom of its scheme.  The fear ofunexpected, natural as it might be, and which we might call insecurity, isfounded in false security, in \co{closedness} of \No, which tries to buildwalls, houses, cities and yet, all the time, knows {\em that} there still may besomething it did not take into account, although it has no idea {\em what} itmight be.  Rising cities, it \co{thirsts} for the woods and fears fires\ldotsHardness assumes that situations one has to be prepared for requirenot only usual foresight but protection, are potentially dangerous and harmful. Strength sees the possible dangers, too, but its purpose is not to protectitself. Greatness displays strength.  \citet{Great man [\ldots] is strong  [\ldots] but he does not desire power. That which he desires is realization of  his intention: realization of spirit. For this realization he needs, of  course, power because power -- if we clean this notion of the dytyrambic  pathos in which Nietzsche enveloped it -- means nothing else but simply the  ability to realize that what one desires to realize.}{ProbMen}{p.55} Greatnessdoes not seek itself, but involves the ability to realize the \thi{objective}intention.  Strength, too, will attempt to realize the intention, to maintain\thi{the order of things}, but it will not be weakened, as greatness would be,by its failure. Strength \co{founded} in \co{humility} may appear strange but isalways unmistakable. It may be associated with the abilities to posit and reachparticular goals, but its strangeness consists in that it does not depend onsuch abilities.  Failing, it perseveres because what it attempts to achieve isnot merely a particular \co{actuality} but an expression of the \co{invisible  command}, realization of spirit. This, on the one hand, admits variousexpressions and, on the other hand, remains valid even when \co{actuality} seemsto ignore it. Strength is the infinite patience which is possible only becauseit knows the \co{eternal presence}. (The ability to work, or wait, patiently fora particular event, in a constant conflict between the expectation of the futureand the current situation, in short, living the tension between thenon-\co{actual} and \co{actual}, is a \co{visible} form of strength.)Eventually, it is the strength of not expecting anything particular, of notfeeling that one is entitled to this or that, of having given up everything and,therefore, having regained it. It is strength which does not have to searchbecause it has already found, which does not have to fight because it alreadyhas everything.\ad{Above the world -- in its midst} All the \co{inversions} can be seen asvariations of the apparent opposition \co{transcendence}-\co{immanence}.\co{One} is fully both: remaining \co{indistinct} \co{above} the world, it isthe \co{rest} ever \co{present} between any \co{distinctions}. \co{Dissociating}these two \co{aspects} is the common mistake which may be, partly, blamed on the\co{inverted} form of \co{manifestations}.  \co{Dissociating} the\co{transcendent aspect} of the \co{one} yields the abstract idea of some staticand immobile, incomprehensible ground.  \citeti{This ground is some homogeneous  silence which remains immobile in itself. And yet from this immobility all  things are set into motion and all things receive life, all which live  suprasensually, silently in themselves.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Mistyka}{    B:I.1.5\kilde{p.197}}} The motion belongs apparently to the \co{visible  world}, but the opposition immobile-mobile -- like that of\co{transcendent}-\co{immanent}, one-many and most others -- is but aconstruction: it may be required by the \co{actual} discourse, but it is harmfulwhen its terms get \co{dissociated}.The \co{inversions} are no contradictions but only \co{reflective} expressionsof the \co{unity} of the respective \co{aspects}: \co{thirst} is the \co{sign}of \co{presence}, \co{forgetfulness} is the way of remembering, strength is the\co{sign} of \co{humility}, vigilant alertness of \co{thankfulness}, and rising\co{above} the world, in the genuine sense, amounts to nothing but a full returninto its midst. \citeti{In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war  from the power of the sword.}{Job}{V:20}\noo{ \sep%  We are not after any necessity of contradictions, after any Lutheran stuff  here.

The most obvious example is personallove.\noo{ Whether it becomes love of the world, of all the people, of life, it  still carries the \co{humility} which prevents it from focusing on  \co{oneself} as well as from forgetting \co{oneself}, which \co{founding} it,  makes it a true love and not a mere appearance of love.  } Love of anotherperson can have many degenerate forms but in its true form it is never aseparate focusing on this only person with the exclusion of everything andeverybody else. A true love of another person is impossible without the\co{presence} of the underlying \co{love}. Love between two people is alwaysimmersed into something bigger, something which only the lovers share and which,in its \co{concrete} and yet \co{invisible presence}, often makes their love offensiveto the social law and customs, bringing the lovers out of \co{this world}, likethe magic of the fatal drink, and then the woods of Morois, to which Tristan andIseult flee from king Mark and his court.\noo{ \subpa Love between two people unfolds always against the background of  \co{presence} which has acquired a friendly, perhaps even ecstatic character.  And yet, this very \co{presence} may have an oddly \co{inverted}  \co{expression} when judged by the standards and customs of \co{this world}.  \citeti{Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send    peace, but a sword.  For I am come to set a man at variance against his    father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against    her mother in law.  And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.  He    that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that    loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.}{Mt.}{X:34-37}  Such an \co{inversion} does not mark a break, an immorality, but at most, an  offense which is so perceived only by those who can not judge otherwise than  according to the ethical -- and in cases of such conflicts, this always means,  pharisean -- prescriptions.  }Personal love is the highest form of relation with another, because it is theultimate form of \co{sharing} -- \co{sharing} the \co{origin}; it is thus notreally a relation but being, as one says, \wo{being together}.  As the meetingwith another person in the face of the common \co{foundation}, personal love is atrue \co{communion}, the \co{communion} of \co{sharing} the \co{origin}.  Thetwo lovers are meeting with something third, something \co{above} them both,which lends its meaning and depth to their mutual relation, that is, theirbeing. And in all their \co{sharing} -- of life, that is of the world, of time,of works and days, of joys and sorrows -- this \co{founding} element, thisindefinable \co{rest} remains \co{clearly present} as the \co{invisible} guarantorof their \co{actual} love.  And thus, offering each other only \co{visible}uncertainties of daily life, they raise from them a rock solid house.The \co{concreteness} of such a personal love may involve fascination with thisor that feature, this or that characteristic of another person, but all suchfeatures are but attractive accidents -- they may be needed for \co{me} to fallin love, but they do not constitute the exclusive \co{foundation} of this love.This love is directed toward the whole person, which means, toward the person as\co{transcending} the particular features and particular ways of being andbehaving -- the person as the center and origin of all such particulars. \co{I}do not divide the loved person into aspects and traits and decide to love herbecause of $a,b,c$ and $d$. If \co{I} can tell why \co{I} love a person, then\co{I} do not love. Sure, \co{I} can list a long series of agreeable andwonderful features of this person, but if this list exhausts the reasons, thenthis is a calculation rather than love.\ftnt{Analogous remarks concerning  friendship figure in \citeauthor*{AristNico}{ VIII:3 [1156b]; IX:1 [1164a].}}Love of a person is love of the whole person, the person seen as the site of\co{incarnation} and this person's \citet{features, activities, abilities are  included into love's object because they belong to this {\em particular}  person.}{Sympatia}{B:III\kilde{p.256}} In this respect \citet{the loved one is impeccable%stainless, spotless, immaculate, unimpeachablein his vesture%apparelat the very beginning of being, because nothing lowers nor stains him in thefirst moment of his revelation and being.}{Ibn}{V:88} \co{I} may, if not at oncethen with time, see all the negative sides of the loved person, but to theextent \co{I} love the person, these are but lower aspects, possible failureswhich, as a matter of fact, can be charming too.\pa %--\mineThe matter is quite different with love which is not \co{founded} in\co{love}, but which stops at the level of \co{mineness}.The lower we descend into \co{this world}, the more strength of will may beneeded to stay true to the \co{inspirations}.  But the strength of will isneeded only to the extent the \co{original commands} get clouded by thelower aspects, as they become identified with some constancy or intensity offeelings.% Antigone says ``I know that I please where I am most bound to please.''  and% this does not involve any conflict of her will.\ftnt{And I do not think that%   this happens merely because, being Greek, she does not have the concept. The%   whole tragedy is built around the choice which we may easily term \wo{a%     conflict of commitment, or will}. }The very attempts at nourishing and keeping the intensity of the beginnings arealready expressions of a loss, that is, expressions of \co{attachment},\co{attachment} to the past. Whether \co{I} insist on \co{my} feelings, \co{my}expectations, \co{my} goals it is all \co{attachment} to the \co{visibility} ofthe past -- whether by attempts to preserve it or negate it -- which hasseparated me from the \co{invisible} source of \co{love}.  Such an\co{attachment} actually \thi{divides} the loved person, puts \thi{+} at$a,b,c,d$ and \thi{--} at $f,g,h$, and when the calculus of \thi{+}s and\thi{--}s yields a negative result, \co{I} become disappointed \ldots with theperson. The disappointments reflect only the fact that \co{my} love was notdirected towards the whole person -- it was cultivated and maintained not forthe sake of the loved person, but for \co{my} own sake.\ftnt{A simple example is  love through which one merely seeks a compensation of some fundamental lack on  one's own part. Not (necessarily) a lack of strength or intelligence or  success, but a {\em fundamental} lack which one \co{vaguely} feels -- the  emptiness at the bottom of one's \co{soul} which the other person would fill,  the uncanny loneliness which the other person would cure, the undefinable  dissatisfaction with \co{life} which the other person would calm, the  \co{thirst}\ldots} Only preoccupation with \co{oneself} -- with its commonform of the sense of entitlement underlying all expectations -- can meetdisappointments; only nourishing \co{my} own image, can \co{I} imagine that theworld owes me anything. Disappointment is not a consequence of such an attitude-- it is its inherent \co{aspect}. And when the \co{traces} of one's commitmentsdo not reach beyond the level of \co{mineness}, such disappointments can indeedseem to sum up to the {\em whole} person who, because of $f,g$ and $h$, is nolonger worthy of \co{my} love.There are no disappointments if one, instead of nourishing expectations,nourishes \co{hope}. \co{Hope} is the lack of expectations, the acceptance of\co{thirst}, unreserved \co{openness}, patience which does not await. \co{Love}is full of \co{hope} not because it all the time awaits something new andbetter, but because it does not -- it already has everything. It knows that allthe particulars need leniency, respectful openness and acceptance.  But such atrue patience and care for things and people are not ontological gifts of the\co{origin}. They are \co{founded} only in the deepest \co{humility} and\co{openness}. If they are not, the patience and respect will, sooner or later,reach the end and then only laziness can prevent them from jumping to newconclusions.\pa \act Personal love, which at the level of \co{actuality} and \co{ego} mayalso be expressed through infatuation, embraces things and situations lendingthem the character of enchantment and agreeable vitality.  This may be a merefeeling, a series of \co{impressions} which change and pass as soon asinfatuation goes away. As Eckhart says about the emotional and sensible love, it\citeti{does not unify. True, it unites in act; but it does not unite in  essence.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Huxley}{ V\kilde{p.87}}} The \thi{unity in essence}is not any emotion, is not a mere infatuation but a lasting love which immersesthe loved one, and the things \co{shared} with the loved one, in a peaceful\co{presence}.  The traces of another's personality, expressed in \co{actual}situations, transform them into a joy of \co{participation}. Even situationswhich otherwise might be inattractive or repulsive, acquire this characterthrough the presence of the loved ones.\noo{It is better to lose with the loved  one, than to find with the hated one.}The \co{spiritual love} is a constant \co{inspiration} for the lower levels, an\co{inspiration} to embrace, strengthen and invigorate -- whether the lovedperson or the things towards which it turns at a given moment.  It is manifestedthrough care and respect for things, as well as for the particular behaviors,feelings and reactions of the loved person.\ftnt{This is perhaps obvious, but  let us emphasize that this care and respect are quite different from  Heidegger's care -- \ger{Sorge}.  \ger{Sorge}, that is, \citef{the Being of    Dasein ahead-of-itself-Being-already-in-(the-world) as Being-alongside    (entities encountered within-the-world) [\ldots] is used in a purely    ontologico-existential manner.  From this signification every tendency of    Being which one might have in mind ontically, such as worry or carefreeness,    is ruled out.}{SuZ}{p.192.}  This corresponds more closely to our horizon  of \co{experience}, with its \co{spatio-temporal actuality} confronted with  the \co{non-actual}, which precedes the constitution of time and separate  \co{experiences}.  Care and respect we are talking about here are, to use  Heidegger's terminology, precisely \thi{ontical tendencies} which Dasein may  or may not realize.} This care and respect need not, of course, meanunconditional acceptance of everything the loved one does.  But all particularswhich one finds blamable are placed at the level to which they belong, at thelevel of \co{actual} failures, and in no way diminish the love.  As we know,the blindness of love may not see, and if it sees will excuse, many things whichothers find inexcusable.  Shall we say that this blindness is what we havecalled an \co{inspiration} from \co{above}? Not necessarily because a mereinfatuation may have similar effect. But it does exemplify the general way of\co{concrete founding}, that is, transformation of the events at the lowerlevels by the \co{concrete} events at the higher ones.%%%%\subpa Sure, the lower we descend into \co{this world}, the more%%\co{distinctions} and more possible choices we face.  The most%%dramatic ones are those which involve a choice between lower and%%higher.  Antigone {\em has to} burry her brother, %%%Polyneices, %%in spite%%of Creon's interdiction and popular fear, shared even by her sister: ``I will%%bury him: well for me to die in doing that.  I shall rest, a loved one%%with him whom I have loved, sinless in my crime; for I owe a longer%%allegiance to the dead than to the living: in that world I shall abide%%for ever.  But if thou wilt, be guilty of dishonouring laws which the%%gods have stablished in honour.''  But Sophocles does not leave any%%doubt -- when the higher \co{command} is \co{expressed} with such a%%\co{clarity}, the choice is obvious.%\newp \pa %-\act\co{Actual} love which is not \co{spiritually founded} will be directed atthings, typically, things which \co{I} want to possess, which is just anexpression of idealization of \co{my ego} as the highest value. It is hard torecognise any true love in narcissistic self-idolatry, but even such extremeforms of \co{egotism} may hide themselves behind the appearances of love.  Notrecognising anything higher than the \co{actuality} of \co{ego} and\co{visibility} of its \co{objects}, one can still yearn for \co{love} and thisyearning can find occasional \co{expressions} of less \co{egotic} character. Butthese will only be occasional \co{expressions}, constantly confused by thetyranny of the \co{egotic} impulses.Another person is no longer loved only for \co{my} sake, honestly thoughconfusedly, but for the sake of some particular thing. \wo{\co{I} love her  smile}, \wo{\co{I} love her meekness}, \wo{\co{I} love her determinacy}, nomatter what particulars happen to arise the reaction, it is only a reactionto the \co{actual} fascination which is cherished for the sakeof satisfaction it gives \co{me}.\newp\pa \imm At the lowest level of \co{immediacy}, love, like anything else, findsonly the most momentaneous \co{expressions}.  Sex can provide a goodexample, as the infinite gap separating the purely carnal sex from the eventof making love to a loved person will be perfectly clear to anybody who hasexperienced both extremes, and to many who haven't.  The sensuous pleasure is notnecessarily \co{spiritually founded} in any higher order of things, but it is tremendouslymodified if such a \co{founding} has taken place.  On the one extreme, it may bea mere moment of escape from the unbearable suffering, a moment of suddenmeeting with eternity in the midst of confusion and evil, like is experienced,for instance, by the war time lovers of Remarque.  It may be an even more desperateattempt to convince oneself that, after all, there are good things in life,things which, in the brief moments of pleasure let one forget about theotherwise empty and desperate life.  All such moments do provide the pleasurethey promise, but the pleasure turns out to be insufficient to calm the soul.And then there remains only \co{more} pleasure, \co{more} intensity, \co{more}-- \wo{the cry of a mistaken soul}.  On the other extreme, a sensuous pleasure ofa moment can be peacefully embraced by the context of mutual respect andunderstanding, and, at the deepest level, of the ineffable \co{love} which, by alucky coincidence, found an \co{incarnation} in the other person, in this verymoment, like an unmerited \co{gift} which never ceases to surprise andplease.\noo{, even only by its mere presence.} \pa %--\immWe will not try to reduce such considerations to the mere contextuality of\co{actual experiences}.  The context of \co{an experience} is \co{more} ofother \co{experiences}, and a well experienced and well paid whore can createsuch a context.  One can buy only moments, \co{actualities}, separate, scatteredparts.  But such parts, and contexts which are their \co{complexes}, especiallyif they are merely bought, will never sum up to \co{an experience} which in asingle moment traverses the whole hierarchy of Being and reaches smoothly thedeepest intimacy of the \co{transcendent presence}.  One does not reach the\co{origin} by taking, one after another, the same single step at a time, eventhough taking one step at a time is all we can do.% But the steps may be wrong while they must be right, and nobody can take them% for me.In all pleasant delusions, which \co{I} bought or arranged, which \co{I} findpurposeful and satisfying, \co{I} always also know -- if only \co{I} do not asktoo intensely -- that they are but momentaneous pleasures, delights of ahedonist, real because \co{actual}, and insufficient, perhaps even empty andunrewarding, because {\em only} \co{actual}.\pa There is no such thing as a single experience which is not permeated bythe whole Being, and it would be as useless to focus on this fact as it isimpossible to ignore and forget it.  There is no such thing as a true moment oflove, unless this moment is immersed in the texture (not context) of body,\co{ego}, \co{soul} and \co{spirit}, which all together agree on the\co{humility} of \co{love} -- in an agreement which goes beyond the bottom ofone's soul and heart, where the \co{spiritual love incarnates}.  Only this wholetexture lends the \co{actual} moment its full meaning, only it makes up its\la{quiddity}, makes it \thi{this \co{concrete experience}} rather than\thi{that}. No \co{visible} rules can ever grasp this distinction with theadequacy and \co{precision} the \co{actual} reason might desire.

Nature and the physicalworld is not ours, we \co{share} it with all the physical things and livingorganisms, and this is a form of \co{communion}.  We \co{share} more withanimals than with dead things, and more with higher animals than withlower ones.  We \co{share} quite a lot with all other people, but there arealways special people, friends, family, the loved ones with whom we \co{share}much more than with the mass of anonymous individuals.That which is \co{shared} is not to be confused with that which is merelycommon.  Common -- in its full ambiguity of universal and ordinary -- is the\co{objective} version to which \co{sharing} reduces when seen only from theperspective of \co{actuality}. What is \thi{common} can not be \co{shared}, itcan only be multiplied, like a universal instantiated in many particulars, likethe sexual drive, common to most animals but never \co{shared} by any two.Looking for most \thi{common} features and traits which, as one thinks, wouldpromote the most universal communication or the sense of community, leads onlyto reducing everything to the least common denominator, to that which being themost universal is also the most ordinary.  Such a search for universality is anattempt to capture \co{more}, to overcome the \co{horisontal transcendence} --it may be useful, but never \co{concrete}.\co{Sharing}, on the other hand, refers always to the \co{vertical  transcendence}, what is \co{shared} is eventually \co{above} \co{me}.\co{Sharing} is not a relation between individuals, but being-together, that is,\co{participating}-together in the \co{one} and the same. \pa\label{pa:originShares} \inv The ultimate \co{communion} is \co{sharing} the\co{origin}, which does not get multiplied and distributed between many, butwhich remains \co{one}, undivided and \co{indistinguished}.  That \co{I} {\em  have} the \co{origin} does not mean that it is \co{mine}. It means only that\co{I} have originated, that \co{I} was \co{born} -- the \co{origin} remains\co{above me}, and thus can never be \co{mine}, it is \co{mine} as much as it is\co{yours}. In the expressions like \wo{having the \co{origin}}, the word\wo{having} does not express the possession but \ldots its opposite:\co{participation}.%To have the \co{origin} means to \co{participate} in it.Having the \co{origin} is the same as \co{sharing} it, for everything hasoriginated from \co{nothingness}. It thus \co{founds} the highest form of\co{communion}, the \co{communion} of \co{participation}, that is, of being.The \co{origin} is \co{shared} -- with whom?  With nobody in particular, with\co{nothing}, that is, with everybody.  This \co{communion} permeates the wholeworld, includes all the people, all \co{visible} and \co{invisible} things,everything which is.  It is the exact opposite of the {detachment} from \co{this  world}, the deepest form of \co{communion} which announces \wo{That art thou},which encounters everything \la{sub specie aeternitas}, as a manifestation ofthe same \co{origin}.Metempsychosis is perhaps one of the oldest expressions of the feeling of such a\co{communion}. But it is only a conceptualisation, is the\co{experienced unity} brought to the level of \co{visible signs}, perhaps, toan attempted explanation. \citeti{For I  was once already boy and girl,\lin Thicket and bird, and mute fish in the  waves.}{Empedocles}{DK 31B117} Interpreting such pronunciations as declarations ofmetempsychosis is a vast over-interpretation. They express genuine feelings, butones which manifest only something \co{transcending} any expression,that is, something which may be \co{present} also without any expression. Onecould hardly postulate migration of souls without \co{recognising}that also animals and even things possess souls, that they too \co{participate}in \co{one} and the same. Metempsychosis is butan image of this \co{recognition} and hence, eventually, of the \co{experienced   unity}. And likewise, its images are the feelings of universal life andensoulment, \citeti{knowing that all things have their  emanations,}{Empedocles}{DK 31B89}the sense of deep kinship which permeates us and lets things grow into and out of us:\begin{verse}{\small{\em Durch alle Wesen reicht der eine Raum:\\Weltinnenraum.

The {world} is a result of \co{dissociations}, of\co{objectivisation} and \co{externalisation}, but it is also the world\co{unified} in its nature of a \co{gift}.  This nature means exactly that it is\co{shared} -- not {\em by} \co{me} with others, but {\em with} \co{me} as a\co{gift} of \co{transcendence}. As a \co{gift}, the world is not \co{mine} atall -- it is \co{shared} with \co{me} by its \co{origin}.  As such a \co{gift}of the world, the \co{confrontation} with the \co{origin} is the primordial\co{communion}.  This \co{communion} of the \co{origin sharing} itself, the\co{existential} \co{confrontation} which is not opposition but \co{openness},can be called the dialogical character of \co{existence}.  The \co{concrete}God, the \co{incarnated} Godhead, is thus the one who \co{shares} the \co{gift},Thou who communicate, a partner of a dialogue, albeit a dialogue which knows nowords, the silent dialogue which \co{existence} conducts with its \co{origin}.\citet{Every concrete hour which, with its world content and destiny, is  allotted to a person, is a noteworthy language.}{Zwie}{I:Verantwortung.  \orig{Jede konkrete Stunde mit ihrem Welt- und Schicksalsgehalt, die der    Person zugeteilt wird, ist dem Aufmerkenden Sprache.}\kilde{p.161}}\noo{ \subpa Recognition of the the world as a \co{gift} requires the  \co{non-attachment}, renunciation of \co{myself}, and thus it is not relative  to \co{my} thinking, wishes, goals.

But  \co{spirituality} is first of all \co{humility} towards the \co{spiritual},  towards the \co{invisible} things.  \citet{Know what is in front of your face,    and what is hidden from you will be disclosed to you.

Since the \co{origin} is common to all of us, itis most intimately and universally \co{shared} by all, we all \co{participate}in one and the same source from which our lives and worlds originate.  This\co{spiritual sharing} is not sharing of this or that, but is \co{sharing} ofthe \co{origin}. To the extent we truly \co{share} any \co{actual} things ormoments, any \co{visible} entities which by and in themselves can only bemultiplied or divided but not \co{shared}, we do so only in the light of this\co{invisible communion}.\noo{ The \la{anima} of this level is, borrowing the Gnostic image, Sapientia,  -- a spiritual wisdom transcending the \co{visible} world towards the most  holy and pure. \la{Animus} is symbolised as an incarnation of spiritual  meaning, a religious leader with spiritual strength and power transcending,  though not contradicting, mere morality.  }\pa\label{pa:recognizePerson}\mineThe center of personal being, the emergence from the\co{confrontation} with the \co{origin}, has thus the character of a dialogue,of a \co{confrontation} with another.

In the same way, the \co{community} of this \co{gift} is also the\co{concrete foundation} of the mutual trust. At the bottom, it is only the\co{recognition} that, eventually, the other is a person like myself,\co{sharing} the same \co{origin}, \co{thirst} and all significant spheres of\co{experience}.  \citetib{Acceptance of the sameness of reality conditions the  spontaneous emergence of love to a human being, that is, love to a being only  because he is <<human>>.}{Sympatia}{A:VI.c\kilde{p.160}} In fact, not only love, butany truly personal relation -- of love or deep admiration, of dedication orrespectful enmity -- is based on such a recognition.

What is soreflected, what is being \co{shared}, might seem to be both \co{mine} and\co{yours} but, as a matter of fact, it is neither \co{mine} nor \co{yours}, forit is \co{shared} only by being \co{above} us both.%unfounded: relating only to an aspect of the person\thi{Recognition and apprehension of the whole person} is exactly to see thisperson as \co{sharing} the \co{origin}, as having an \co{invisible} pact withGod, just like the one \co{I} have.%It is beyond any \co{visible} grounds and reasons. Thus\citet{Human life touches the absolute through its \thi{dialogical character};  [\ldots] man can become whole not through a relation to his own self but only  through a relation to another self.

But we are moreconcerned with the \co{foundation} of such \co{experiences} which, as also Bubermaintains, is the unconditional, or \co{absolute}.  The dialogical\co{experience} can be also \co{an experience} of the unconditional. But theunconditional \co{presence} is not the \co{object} of such \co{an experience} --it is the \co{rest} \co{experienced} only {\em along} the \co{actual} situation,{\em through} the meeting with the other. It is the \co{participation} in the\co{absolute} which \co{founds ontologically} such \co{experiences}, and onlythe genuine \co{openness} of \Yes\ which \co{founds} their \co{concrete}possibility.\ftnt{Dialogues with other persons do not exhaust such  \co{experiences}. An unexpected \co{recognition} may often give rise to it, as  when we suddenly get swept by the immense beauty of a landscape. An experience  in which the fact of encounter comes strongly forth, involves often equally  the sense of unity. These two \co{aspects} together constitute the dialogical  character of \co{experience}. Mystical experiences provide many examples,  while here is a bit more mundane case of a similar force: \citef{From a low    hill in this broad savanna a magnificent prospect opened out to us. To the    very brink of the horizon we saw gigantic herds of animals: gazelle,    antelope, gnu, zebra, warthog, and so on. Grazing, heads nodding, the herds    moved forward like slow rivers. There was scarcely any sound save the    melancholy cry of a bird of prey. This was the stillness of the eternal    beginning, the world as it had always been, in the state of non-being; for    until then no one had been present to know that it was this world.

If not at the sociological level (whichnourishes much of the \thi{otherness} talk), then certainly at the human levelthe other is, for the most, the same. The other is the same as you -- onlyanother. One \co{birth}, like every \co{absolute} beginning, is \co{virtually}the same as any other -- only numerically distinct. Sure, he is a differentperson, with whom I even may be unable to communicate -- not to mention, toagree. But communication and agreement have all too often been degenerated to apetty accord of opinions or a sheer coincidence of wordings to deserve somecensuring. I can not understand the other by the sheer act of accepting hisotherness. {\em Accepting} otherness means nothing else but searching deeperinto oneself (which does not mean looking for more discoveries {\em about}\co{oneself} but searching for the harmony {\em of} and {\em in} one's\co{self}). I understand, or at least can understand the other, only because, atthe bottom of our souls\noo{(and this is much deeper than any psychological,sociological or political constructions can ever reach)} we \co{share} the mostfundamental aspects of \co{existence}: eventually, we \co{share} the\co{origin}, stand before the same God.%\tsep{culture, tribe...}\pa \co{Community} has, of course, also the inter-personal, cultural orsociological dimension.\ftnt{In terms of the mere \co{objective} time and  the sheer numbers this might seem to be much more of a \thi{community} than  the personal relations which concern us. However, we do not study sociology,  nor even the individual reflections of the social domain. Such a reflection is  possible only because the individual is already a dialogical being, capable of  genuine \co{sharing} independently from the form of community into which he is  born.  Moreover, it is the personal relations which open most directly the  sphere of \co{community} in the face of the same \co{origin}. The tribal,  communal, social, traditional organisation will first of all veil and entangle  the direct, \oo\ \co{signs} of \co{sharing} into the \co{objective} -- and hence  both lasting but also less readable -- forms of \co{symbols} and other \co{reflectivesigns}. To become a   member of a \co{community} means often to decipher the codes of its tradition  in a way which allows one to live them satisfactorily, that is, with a  personal conviction but also with a full respect, though not unreserved  openness, to other traditions.}The above, universally human \co{community} becomes relativised as \co{sharing}concerns more specific contents. But it is all the way \co{founded} on\co{sharing}.  It is not so that, for instance, problems or enemies create\co{community}; at best, only {\em common} problems and {\em common} enemiesdo. But in order to be common they must threaten some \co{shared} dimension,that is, they only reveal, make \co{visible} the \co{community} which hasalready existed.\ftnt{One might be tempted to see in various \thi{encounterswith \abr{ufo}s}, in much of the science-fiction frenzy andin the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the signs reflectinga relatively high level of global consciousness which sees humankind as a unitybut, scared by its apparent emptiness, that is, lacking \co{foundation}, still needs \thi{another}, a \thi{common neighbour} if not enemy, as its \co{external} and \co{objective} guarantor.}\noo{Thus,national or ethnic characters of various peoples are expressions of the \co{shared} background (historical, geographical, etc.). }It is essential for a \co{community} to \co{share} something which\co{transcends} mere \co{actuality}.  A group of mere common interests, an\co{actual} group which shares only a hobby or a problem, is not a\co{community}. Any group of only \co{actual} goals or interests is as relativeand transient as these goals and interests themselves -- it can be only asurrogate of a \co{community}. A \co{community} transcends any \co{actual}horizons, it can be a cultural tradition, a nation, a tribe, a family. I onceheard a native American saying to his children: \wo{White people have been herefor 500 years, {\em we} have been here for 15000 years.  They make choices basedon what seems cool and advantageous to them but this is not how {\em we} make ourchoices.  {\em We} have got this land and we have to care for it for futuregenerations.  Our private wishes are not what counts most.} Belonging to a tribeis to belong to the world which is far greater than \co{me}, is to be only amember of a \co{community} which \co{transcends} the sphere of \co{my life}.  Therespect  shown for one's land and its tradition is an \co{expression} of \co{sharing} something which doesnot belong to anybody, which is greater than \co{me} and you, than our ancestorsand successors.  Similarly, the respect for the ancestors, or generally for thehistory (of the nation, tribe, family), is an expression of the constitutiverole of the \co{transcendence} -- not only the mythological beginnings, but thewhole past of the \co{community} lies beyond our \co{actual} grasp, and itsgreat moments express and witness to the unity of the \co{shared} ethos andorigin.\noo{\subpa For Westerners it may still sometimes be the consciousness of belongingto the nation.  No matter what group is concerned (as long as it is not a merely\co{actual} group), the recognition of the sound values of this group, whichoverride \co{my} private preferences, and healthy dedication to theirrealization is a possible, \co{visible expression} of belonging to a\co{community}.  As \co{I} am, at this level, distinct from you and everything\co{not-mine}, \co{my community} will be distinct from \thi{others}, from\thi{them}, but this distinction need not carry the negative meaning of anopposition or even conflict.  For the first, it is not so much \co{my} group asopposed to \co{not my} group -- it is {\em this} group as opposed to {\em that},and it just so happens that \co{I} belong to this one.  And furthermore, thedistinction between the groups need not mean conflict, in any case, not afundamental enmity.  The groups just happen to live different traditions anddifferent values, occupy different regions of \co{this world}.  The \wo{healthy  dedication to its values} means their recognition as {\em only} one -- asopposed to {\em the only} one -- possible \co{manifestation} of the\co{invisible foundation}. As far as this \co{foundation} is concerned, itremains the same \co{above} all the \co{visible} differences. The capacity torecognise also other's values as such a \co{manifestation} (and this does notmean their adoption, but an acceptance and thorough respect, with or withoutunderstanding the \co{actual} details) is the condition for being able to liveone's own values in a \wo{healthy} manner. Just like the incapacity to resolve(which sometimes may simply mean: ignore) contradictions is a sign of a mindfalling into the narrowness of \co{actuality}, so any tendency to emphasize theoppositions and conflicts between the apparently contrary cultural traditionswitnesses only to the insecurity of the tradition showing suchtendencies.\ftnt{We mean that it applies to all the successfully conquesting and  expanding civilisations (whose initial, and the strongest, impulse springs  from the opposition to a higher, or in any case, more confident and  self-satisfied culture), as well as to all the unsuccessful ones.  Unfortunately, we do not exactly know what \wo{successful} could mean in this  context, so we won't elaborate.}} %%%%%% end \noo{ Westerners%\tsep{unfounded}\pa  %--\mineAt the personal level, the \co{unfounded community} recognises the other as you butnot as Thou.  You may be an equal partner, perhaps a guide or a friend, withwhom I can establish a community through interaction and sharing values, views,life-style, something more than mere goals and contents dictated only by the\co{actual} situation. But as long as not \co{concretely founded}, this remainsan incomplete relation.%, like those which tend to break up in the so-called \wo{mid-life crisis}.The relation will carry the negative counterparts to those listed in\refp{pa:recognizePerson}: I can recognise you as simply different person,without recognising that we \co{share} the \co{origin}, I can reduce the\co{shared} to something merely common, eventually, some \co{actual} contentswhich tend towards \co{objective} and \co{egotic} characteristics.  Thus ourrelation, bereft of higher \co{foundation}, becomes afraid of every conflict atthe level of \co{actual} opinions and decisions, becomes threatened by more andmore minute details, like ebbing love often does. As always, whatever is not\co{concretely founded}, which in particular means, \co{founded} in somethinghigher, tends toward its lower version.%\pa\co{Unfounded communion} at the level of \co{mineness} is still sharing. It isnot, however, \co{sharing} something higher but sharing \co{myself}, whatever\co{I} happen to understand by this at the moment. \co{I} can dedicate \co{my}activities to a common good, to a beneficial work for the society, \co{I} canbecome personally engaged -- but in all that \co{I} share only \co{myself} andkeep experiencing this sharing as sacrifice.  Enclosed in the circle of\co{mineness}, \co{I} oppose selfishness to unselfishness, \co{my} private lifeand interests to the good and interests of others. And thus the engagement intothe latter assumes a character of a sacrifice on \co{my} part. No matter howpossibly useful and socially valuable, such an attitude, called by Kierkegaard``ethical'', finds itself in a constant conflict which it is unable to resolveotherwise than by negating it or turning \co{my attachment} into the \co{idol}of \co{my} generousness, \co{my} benevolence, \co{my} self-sacrifice.But as \wo{one cannot will into void,}$^{\ref{ftnt:willVoid}}$ all \co{my}dedication must be directed towards some positive contents and values.  A commonform of this is \thi{identification} with one's community, various cases ofcommunal or, perhaps, communistic consciousness, when the abstractly universalgood and interests of this community become one's highest values.  When one'scommunity -- tribe, nation, class, religion -- is the only source of truth then,indeed, nationalism or tribal consciousness acquire unhealthy form of ethnocentrism.Such an absolutisation of a relative is possible only because one does notrecognise its \co{foundation} in the higher sphere -- here it ends, thereis nothing \co{above}, and this is the last, absolute truth, its finalexpression.\pa\label{pa:notPerspectivism} % We see here the difference between this view of \co{community} and all forms of% relativism and extreme perspectivism. (Book I:\refsp{sub:pantheism}.)As a matter of fact, relativism is an example of such an \co{idolatry}, of theinability to \co{recognise} the ultimate value \co{above} the multitude of\co{visible} differences. It is different from \co{ego-} andethnocentrism in that it avoids absolutisation of one particular ethos. But,staying at the same level, it is only its complementary and inverted side which does not reach any deeper.% Let us begin to look at this form the % personal level -- the social one is only accumulation of the \citet{Every person coming to the world brings something new, something that has  never existed before, something original and unrepeatable.

Accusing him  of pantheism and relativism would certainly be unjust, though shadows of both  can be discerned, as usual, behind the eschatological predilections.)} We seethe reappearing tension between One and Many, which tries to disappear in theclose relationship between the perspectivism of the latter and the pantheisticunderstanding of the former.  This last quote suggests that the \co{absolute} issomehow the sum of the individual perspectives.  But such a sum is only a\co{posited totality}, not anything \co{absolute}, it is the \co{vertical  transcendence} of the \co{one} thought in terms of the \co{horizontal  transcendence} of multiple \co{actual} manifestations. The unrepeatability ofevery man is \co{founded} in the very \co{confrontation} with the \co{absolute};it does not merely add a bit to its \co{actualisation}. But taken in the merely\co{horizontal} dimension, it turns indeed into the ultimate relativism, wherethe absolute aspect of every separate \co{existence} does not carry more weightthan that of the \co{actually} different contents, of one \co{actual} part ofthe whole.  Like all the attempts to reduce the \co{absolute} to the \co{actual}(whether the pantheistic \co{totality}, regulative ideas of reason, truth as theinaccessible limit, etc.), it results in delegating the \co{absolute} not onlyto the sphere of \co{transcendence} (where it indeed resides) but also {\em out  of} the sphere of \co{immanence}, outside the horizon of anything anindividual might ever confront fully and \co{concretely}.We follow only the first of the above quotes. Theuniqueness and unrepeatability of every \co{existence} not only does not excludethe \co{confrontation} with the \co{absolute} but is \co{founded} exactly in it.Every \co{existence} is a reflection of the same \co{absolute}, not a part ofit, but an \co{absolute} image, \la{imago Dei}. The images may differ withoutceasing to be the images of the same and without implying that only their sum totalcatches the glimpse of what they reflect.  \citet{And just as the same town when  seen from different sides will seem quite different, and as it were multiplied  {\em perspectivally}, the same thing happens here: because of the infinite  multitude of simple substances it is as if there were as many different  universes; but they are all perspectives on the same one, according to the  different {\em point of view} of each monad.}{Monad}{57. It is not clear to us  if it bothered Leibniz whether this very statement is or is not only one  possible perspective -- of the monad actually pronouncing it.}  Thedifferences of perspectives emerge with the \co{visible} contents where, indeed,every one may have his own view and understanding. However, ignoring the lowestand most trivial cases, these differences donot result from any \co{subjective} choices. At the bottom of it,nobody decides which perspective he will entertain -- one's perspective is anintegral \co{aspect} of one's \co{concrete existence} and evolves along withit.\noo{This \thi{givenness} of the perspective is something of the absolute.} Above all, it concerns only \co{visibles}, for even our understanding of the\co{invisibles} and \co{absolute} is only \co{actuality} of\co{visibles}. Consequently, all these differences never sum up to give any whole, because the \co{absolute} is not any\co{totality} of \co{visibles}. All the \co{actual} differences are equally\co{founded} in \co{one} and the same, and all \co{existences} are equally\co{confronted} with it. To reach this \co{confrontation} no addition is needed,because the \co{absolute} is not any \co{totality} of differentiated contents,but their prior \co{unity}.\ftnt{Thus, while the usual perspectivism, claiming  that there are only different perspectives, must end in relativism, our  \thi{perspectivism} admits not only different views, but also different levels  of views, which all are only reflections of the \co{one}. \citef{Surely the    diversity isn't in the thing gazed on, but in the {\em way} of gazing on it    [...] While the same thing is understood, nevertheless it's not understood    equally.}{AbelardPJC}{II:\para 325} Dissolution of particular \thi{substances}  and \thi{essences} notwithstanding, we still (or rather exactly for this  reason) have \co{one} and only \co{one} to \co{share} and understand.

A form of%friendship or even personal love can be expressions of such%communion.\pa\label{pa:relativism} The problem is that the \co{unity} of this ultimate\co{communion} is a mere \co{that}, while one would rather like to find it insomething more particular, in some \co{visible} \thi{whats}. But as noparticular \thi{whats} seem to offer the answer\ldots Relativism is but avariation on this theme of egocentrism, is but its inversion absolutising theabsence of deeper values which would still be \co{visible}. It is, likeegocentrism, the inability to recognise anything higher than the \co{visible}divisions, but combined with the inability to sign the doom which narrow-mindedegocentrism pronounces on all otherness. The inability to recognise somethinghigher is simply a sign of lacking self-respect, of the fact that one's own orone's own community's values are not so convincing and deep as \co{that} one is\co{thirsting} for.  Genuine respect in disagreement, recognition of othervalues which \co{I} do not share, can be \co{founded} only in \co{sharing} oftheir source. If such a source is not found while, at the same time, one feelsuneasy absolutising the \co{mine} with all its historical and social contingencythen, indeed, the only possibility is to state relativity of all \co{visible  signs}. {\em This} relativity of relativism is not, however, the relativity ofthe \co{actual sign} anchored in the \co{absolute origin} but, on the contrary,the mere arbitrariness of this \co{sign} as opposed to that \co{sign}.Relativism is grounded in the inability to find anything higher than themultiplicity of \co{actual signs}.  The problem with relativism (a bit like withnegative theology) is not that it is too extreme but, on the contrary, that itdoes not go far enough. Relativism is \co{idolatry} which seems and claims tohave escaped all \co{idols}. It does not put this value/nation/group/\ldots infront of that, it does not \co{idolize} this, by putting it above that. It doesnot. But it \co{idolizes} some level of \co{visible} \co{distinctions} as theabsolute one, \co{above} which no more \co{unity} can possibly obtain.\newpa\paNow, one can be proud of belonging to one's nation, one can be even willingto sacrifice one's life for it, but if this nation is the deepest value whichone is capable to recognise then it will easily end innationalism of a dubious shade. However, one can be proud of that and, atthe same time, recognise the possibility of others' being proud of belonging totheir nations and even of some not bothering about such a thing at all.  Theconflict between one ethos and another may be of fundamental character but forthe most it is a conflict resting on the absolutisation of \co{visible  expressions}, of the \co{signs} which merely announce, always only in oneparticular form, the \co{invisible presence} which is truly \co{shared}.One can live thoroughly the values of one's cultural or religious formationand, at the same time, recognise equally validity of other values.  Butfor this recognition to be genuine and honest, one must first find thetrue \co{inspiration} in the values one is living, that is, to recognisetheir \co{spiritual foundation}. This recognition of, at once, relativity and\co{absolute foundation}, involves perhaps a bit more self-respect than one isused to, but is far from impossible.  Now, just like all \co{visibility} is\co{founded} in the \co{invisible}, so all \co{presence} of the \co{absolute} isinterwoven into the matter of \co{this world}. There is no other way of\co{participation} than through some form of tradition, historical consciousnessand involvement into the \co{actual world}.  Only through \co{visibility} is the\co{invisible} \co{present}. \co{My} task is to recognise the\co{manifestations} of this \co{presence} in the world in which \co{I} live. Themultiplicity of religions is but an expression of the unavoidable\co{incarnation} of the \co{invisible} in the \co{visible}. And to the extentthese are true religions, that is, to the extent they are based on therecognition of \co{invisible origin above this world}, they all provide meansfor finding a way to rebirth and salvation. The fact that somebody born in Tibetdoes it on the way of Buddhism, while somebody born in Europe on the way ofChristianity, does not in any way diminish the ultimate \co{sharing}. This\co{sharing}, however, does not mean uniform agreement. It is possible only byliving one's own, \co{concretely founded} ethos, for the differences betweencultural and religious formations, relative as they are, are thoroughly real.Originating in the same, they reach the level of \co{actuality} where all our\co{acts} take place. To the extent \co{I} live an ethos of a \co{community},\co{I} can live only one such at a time, and whoever tries to live more thanone, ends up living none.  But there is no need to live more than one,because each true ethos is a full expression of all levels of Being. If onedoes not find it here, one won't find it there, and if one finds it there, onewill see that it has been here all the time.  It takes an analphabet to believethat the \thi{truth} is written somewhere else. The inability to recognise thedeepest values embodied in one's culture underlies the ecstatic escape towards\thi{otherness} and its \thi{truth}, and is only a stage of relativism %reflecting the inability to recognise \co{sharing} in one's own...in which one ends up allowing all possibilities, that is, being unable to relateto any. For where everything is allowed, nothing has any value.  Merely allowingfor other values or forms of worship, in a truly democratic and relativisticway, is perhaps politically optimal but, at the same time, it amounts todisrespecting all such values by delegating them to the sphere of everybody's\thi{subjectivity}.  To respect them, is to recognise their genuine\co{foundation}, but \citet{we must have [first] given all our attention, all  our faith, all our love to a particular religion in order to [be able to]  think of any other religion with the high degree of attention, faith, and love  that is proper to it.}{WeilWaiting}{Forms of the Implicit Love of God:The love  of religious practices;p.119} True religion is but a form of ultimate\co{sharing}, and finding it once, one has no need of finding it once moresomewhere else. But if one did not find it, one keeps looking and, in the courseof deeper and deeper disappointments, one can eventually start believing that itis nowhere to be found, and that one should better get rid of the ladder, onceone has climbed on it to the roof of this \thi{insight} in the relativity andmere auxiliary role of all particular ladders.\noo{ The Jungian \la{anima}/\la{animus} acquire at this level a moral  character.  \la{Anima}, represented by Virgin Mary, raises love out of the  sphere of mere instincts to a higher level of devotion. \la{Animus} takes  often the form of a wise professor who commands the word and is capable of  moral guidance.  }\pa\actThe \co{actual} expressions of \co{founded communion} amount to \co{sharing} the\co{actual experiences}, situations, problems. One would be tempted to mention herealso joys and sorrows, pains and satisfactions, but let us be a bit careful. Amultitude of \co{acts} can express \co{sharing} -- \co{acts} of cooperation andexchange, of compassion and helpfulness, of criticism and appraisal\ldots%Let compassion serve as an example. Such \co{acts} address the \co{actual} situation involving, perhaps, the other'sproblem or achievement. This problem or achievement is not something whichbelongs to the other and is privately his, just like {your} problem is notmerely {yours} -- they are just that: problems, achievements, sorrows, joys.When {you} meet them, they are simply there and become {yours} by arising {your}reaction.  They are \co{shared} to the extent {you} recognise their objectivecharacter and do not focus on the fact of their belonging only to the other.The strongest form of such \co{sharing} is actually living the same\co{experience}, for instance, the loss of a beloved child \co{shared} by bothparents or more trivial examples of a team \co{sharing}, along with the samegoals, the successes and defeats in their realization.  But the same structureunderlies genuine \co{sharing experiences} which, phenomenologically, belonginitially to other person.  Meeting a smile, a joyful spark in the other's eyes,a happy moment in his life, {you} do not \co{share} it by observing it,concluding that it belongs to another, and then deciding to participate in it.Neither do you \co{participate} in it by trying to evoke the feelings andimpressions the other might have. To the extent {you} \co{participate} in it, tothe extent {you} \co{share} it, the fact that it is another's and not {yours} isthoroughly real, yet of negligible importance: a part of the world, the\co{actual} situation is \co{shared} and it is neither his nor yours.  Andalthough \co{reflection} will tell you that there is a sharp \co{distinction},you know that it is not telling the whole truth.\co{Sharing} other's joys and happiness which, on the face of it, are entirelyirrelevant for us, expresses genuine \co{communion} for, as we know, it is notalways so easy to overcome the sense of envy which witnesses to \co{egotic}limitations.  Let us, however, use as a much more common example compassion. Itis not any feeling which has to be aroused in order to reproduce another's pain.\co{Actual} communion is not a mere empathy, a mere emotional identificationwith that which is other's.  Reducing \co{actual} communion to empathy,misconstrued as entering into another's feelings, is a \co{subjectivistic}reduction, which not only misses completely the nature of the phenomenon butalso precludes the \co{subject} from leaving its solipsistic universe. In fact,compassion need not be (though it often is) accompanied by any specificfeelings. Feelings, \co{moods} and \co{impressions} are only \co{signs} -- asall \co{signs} -- of something \co{transcendent}, that is, not reduced to their\co{subjective immediacy}. They reveal an aspect of the world and point tosomething which can also be revealed in other ways. People with apparently cooland unemotional personality are capable of perfectly compassionate attitudes and\co{acts}, no less so than others.  \co{Sharing} expressed in an \co{act} ofcompassion need not be accompanied by any specific feelings -- but it must be\co{concrete}! It must spring from the depth of your person, not necessarilyfrom any \co{actual} and deep feelings but from the \co{recognition} of the needof it, of the call from the \co{actual} situation to you.  The fact that one cangenuinely feel {\em with} another, pain or joy, is secondary to the fact thatone relates to the same sphere of the world from which his pain or joy arises.One does not feel {\em his} pain, and one does not even try to {\em imagine} it.One feels {\em one's} pain which participates in the same -- \co{shared} --painful experience as does his pain. Whether this experience is given alsothrough other forms (for instance, one knows why he is in pain, or even why heshould be in pain even if he does not seem to be) or only through his painfulexpression, is only of secondary importance. For compassion addresses {\em the  same experience}, of which another's pain is only a \co{sign}, his reaction.As it happens, \co{shared} pain diminishes. \citet{Pain is alleviated when  friends share the sorrow.}{AristNico}{IX:11 [1171a]} Of course, one might say,the pain of the one who suffered first, but not of the one who joins in. But no,the pain of both or, let us put it this way, the \thi{total amount of pain}.Pain and suffering is not any \co{invisible} truth which only increases by being\co{shared}. On the contrary, particular pain -- just like money -- diminisheswhen it is \co{shared} with another, it becomes divided between all who\co{share} it. For the other, who comes with compassionate support, itdiminishes to the same extent as it diminishes for the one who was suffering.For what \co{motivated} compassion was pain which he experienced, perhaps in avery different way from the one \co{actually} suffering, but still entirely andreally. Moreover, genuine compassion comes with the voluntary acceptance of thepain. This acceptance does not intend any compassion. It is a mere \co{act}, amere answer to the call which is \co{founded} in -- we may say, dedicatedexclusively to -- the ultimate \co{communion}, that is, \Yes\ for which pain isnot evil but trial.\ftnt{Avoiding pain is an obvious reaction and it could be  used to motivate avoiding compassion which amounts to \co{sharing} it. The  above says that, on the contrary, \co{sharing} does not amount to seeking pain  but only to its diminishing. True compassion results always in help. Moreover,  there is a difference between avoiding and escaping from, between not looking  for pain and turning away in the face of it. In the latter case it is already  too late and this is the case were compassion is called for. Escaping from  \co{actually} encountered pain (of another's as much as of oneself) is like  escaping from suffering which, as said in  \ref{sec:evil}.\refp{pa:evilsSuffer}, is a source of \co{alienation}.}\noo{And what is compassion? You will know when you see it.    Feeling is here only a \co{sign} of the recognition of the \co{shared}  reality.  \thi{Co-feeling and co-experiencing another's emotional state} is  only (and only at best) a \co{sign} of \co{sharing} something more than just  this state.  }% Compassion is all embracing because it does not divide people into those who% reached the adequate spiritual level and deserve understanding and% those who did not and therefore have only themselves to thank for% their problems.\pa In a given situation, compassion is directed exclusively and completelytowards the person and yet, in a sense, it is completely \thi{impersonal}. This\thi{impersonality}, however, is an expression of the deepest respect for theperson.  The situation where, for instance, I act compassionately towards thesuffering person but only because and in so far as he is a member of~\ldots myfamily, my group, my nation, is not an example of compassion but of itsmisunderstanding.  The suffering person is the \co{absolute} center of thesituation and compassion is an expression of the ultimate \co{communion} -- with{\em this} person. \citet{It is not so that <<compassion -- as such -- is  shameless>>, as Nietzsche says, but compassion without love towards the one  whom we compassionate. [...] Therefore we notice also that every expression of  compassion {\em without} love to the person is felt as a  brutality.}{Sympatia}{A:XI\kilde{p.225-6}} \thi{Love to the person} is the\co{concrete foundation} of \co{actual} compassion. Its ultimacy, or as we said\wo{impersonality}, means only that if the suffering person happened to besomebody else, the compassion would still be the same. In particular, thisexpresses only the \co{concrete foundation}, not any universality of compassion,of which the present person would be only \thi{an instance}.  Compassion is aproperty of \co{acts}, not of life.  It is not like \co{love} which, underneathevery \co{act} and \co{activity}, extends to the whole world.  Suggesting such auniversality of compassion, as done for instance in \citeauthor*{Unamuno},amounts also to suggesting that the whole world is in a soar need for it, thatthe whole world is a scene of all embracing misery and that life has only tragicsense.  Such an exaggerated compassion, a category of \co{actuality} applied tothe whole world, is but an exaggerated feeling which comes closer to patronisingin its lack of the basic \co{thankfulness}.  Compassion does not pity anybodynor anything, for pity hides some lack of respect, we could perhaps say, pity iscompassion without respect. Compassion does not pity the tragic sense oflife, the unbearable and unavoidable involvement into the evil of the world, thecorruption of one's soul.  It arises only in \co{actual} situations which callfor it and, otherwise, knows that everything is a \co{gift}, though some ofthese \co{gifts} may be harder to carry than others. Respect for thesuffering person resides in the acknowledgment of this truth and in thecommunicated conviction that he, too, acknowledges it. \pa \co{Concrete founding} of \co{acts} is often expressed by an \co{inversion}.Love, just like friendship, can point out what it perceives as mistakes orfailures on the other's part.  Recognising and apprehending the whole person, itmay (sometimes even should) lack the unconditional acceptance of everything theother person does. Critique and disagreement is possible -- in full friendship,or love, and appreciation of the person -- only because the \co{community} isnot reduced to the level of the \co{actual} situation and one's feelings,thoughts, acts.  Only because it is \co{founded} in the recognition of thepersonal value, in the deeper \co{community} of values and, eventually, of the\co{origin}, it can judge the \co{act} without judging the person.  Thus, forinstance, help can take the form one would consider harmful, a good advice mayhappen to be the opposite of what one wanted to hear and expected. If onecould anticipate it, one would not be in such a dear need of it, and so it wouldnot be {\em such a good} advice. When one hears it, one may not understand it,one may not know {\em what} makes it a good advice; but then one also know {\em  that} one should probably follow it.In many situations %like those of particular hardship or confusion,there will be much more friendship in saying right things which the other does notwant to hear, than in the flat acceptance of everything the other does.\noo{ \thi{Other} is an \co{aspect} of the dialogical character of  \co{existence}, of \co{communion}. We are considering the modifications of the  former only to the extent they follow the modifications of the latter. The  \co{actual community} is not limited to other persons but embraces most of  \co{this world}.  The level, or the depth of \co{communion} depends on the  possibility of \co{sharing}. It is only at the personal level, and only with  an individual person, that the full \co{communion} is possible.  The less we  can \co{share}, the lesser the \co{communion}.    The intricacies of the possible biological classifications notwithstanding,  all animals and living organisms belong, too, to the common \co{origin} and  although stay \co{below} \co{me}, open the possibility of \co{sharing}.  This  may be \co{expressed} as care and respect for their being, as a recognition of  the value which is inherent in their being, a powerful example of which was  given by St.~Francis of Assisi\ftnt{For example, in the \btit{Prayer for      animals} he says: \woo{Give us the grace to see all animals as gifts from      You and to treat them with respect for they are Your creation. We pray for      all animals who are suffering as a result of our neglect.}{FrancAnimal}    One might be tempted to see in (the reported) objection of Pythagoras' to    somebody beating a dog -- \wo{I recognise my dead friend in him!}  --    exactly the same attitude, not necessarily an expression of the faith in    metempsychosis.}, and which Buddhists try to live almost literally. Now,  this might sound almost like \citet{Arise and drink your bliss, for every    thing that lives is holy!}{BlakeAlbion}{} But we should remember that just  like holiness of a holy person is not his property but the state of  \co{concrete participation}, so too this \thi{holiness} of living things is not  their property, and even less any property of some ecstatic relation to them;  it is an expression of \co{sharing} the \co{origin}.  }%\tsep{unfounded... = absolutisation of subject}%unfounded: allowing & accepting everything - infatuated woman, or confused parent\pa The \co{unfounded} community of mere \co{actuality} will often do theopposite and acclaim everything the other does, like confused parent or teacherfollowing guidelines of all too liberal pedagogy. One feels forced to acceptevery \co{actual} wish and expression of the other because, without any deeper\co{foundation}, everything one is able to relate to are \co{actual}expressions, whether of genuine needs or of mere whims.  Thus, although onestill strives for a deeper community, one remains perplexed by the underlyingabsolutisation of the \co{actual} feelings and \co{subjectivity}.Without such a deeper \co{foundation}, \co{ego} remains a \co{dissociated} atom,a pure \co{subjectivity}, reduced to the privacy of its \co{actual} feelings andthoughts which -- not only etymologically -- amounts toprivation.\ftnt{\wo{\la{Privare}} means \thi{to deprive} and its passive  participle, \wo{\la{privatus}}, serves also as adjective and noun.\noo{. = p.p.    of privare (deprive); privationem}} \co{Ego} without \co{concrete  foundation} is the archetype of \co{alienation}, and an image, a frequent\co{actual} form of that is loneliness. Loneliness is another side of privacy, aresult of the other having been pressed outside the sphere of \co{my} privacyand reduced to a mere aspect of \co{my} situation, perhaps, still an activesubject but not one to whom \co{I} have any personal relation -- the otherbecomes a mere \thi{he}. It can be an anonymous adversary in a situation where,although himself present, he functions only as a \thi{third person}, a merefactor in the \co{actual} game.  This is the way we often relate to clerks orsalespersons in offices and shops, when the whole contact is reduced to animpersonal relation dictated by the actual context. The communication is a merematter of routine exchange or else of gaining control over the external factorswhich, accidentally, can also be embodied in the other person. Exactly the samesuperficiality characterises communication at the cocktail-parties which have themore jolly and merry surface, the more despair and hardship is trying to hideunder it. One often seeks a \thi{merry company} as a medicine against bad\co{mood}. In such a company, however, one does not so much \co{share} the goodmood as is infected by it. Such a contagious, often heavy, atmospherecharacterises all forms of \co{actuality} in which the participants, wishing fora community, almost force themselves to \co{actually} share it, overcoming thefelt \co{alienation} in the depersonalising power of a trance: a discotheque, apolitically agitating meeting, an orgy, a gambling hall, a sermon of atelevangelist.\ftnt{The classic of \citeauthor*{LeBon}, provides excellent  descriptions of the involved mechanisms. }\noo{In a more pragmatic vein, one can recognise that goals and projects can beshared between people, that one can meaningfully -- which here means, to one'sadvantage -- engage in common activities and pay due attention to lessprivate issues.  What can be \co{shared} here are goals and objectives which canbe common to several people, perhaps, to whole parties and communities. Atypical example, besides political parties, would be mere interest or discussiongroups, where the participants might equally well remain anonymous if only theycould provide the same contribution to the common agenda.%(E-mail lists and chat-rooms come all too easily to mind.)}Sartre's novels and plays provide extreme examples of such a community which isa mere multiplicity of \co{alienated}, mutually \co{external egos}.  \btit{Being  and Nothingness} gives a systematic description of the absolutisedsubjectivity failing to establish any meaningful form of \co{community}, of theconstant attempts of the conscious for-itself to turn another into anobjectified and devitalized in-itself. Even love reduced for the poor man to amere master-slave dialectic between \co{dissociated subjectivities} trying tosubdue each other.  This, of course, led nowhere as benefiting from another'ssubmissive acts establishes perhaps dependence, but not any \co{communion}. Andeven if the other's acts are voluntary and made of good will, they do notnecessarily open for \co{me} the door to \co{participation} in any\co{communion}. For \co{concrete participation} requires a \co{choice} and isthoroughly active. We own only what we give.\label{own-give} The strongest bondsknit us not with people who did us good but with those to whom we did some good -- and thebonds are the tighter, the more good we do to them.  Receiving gifts orservices, made of good will alone, is a much more difficult art than onecommonly imagines. Genuine freedom (\refpf{pa:invfreedom}) is required toreceive gifts without becoming inferior (for shamelessness can protect onlyagainst the mere {\em sense} of inferiority).\ftnt{The custom of potlatch  (\citeauthor*{Mauss}), amounting to almost destructive competition in  surpassing the generosity of the received gift by the returned one, can be  viewed as a social expression of the psychological dependence of the  recipient.  On the other extreme, there are -- more advanced -- societies so  thoroughly lacking \co{concrete community} that the fear of owing anything  makes it almost unthinkable for an individual to receive any minor service, a  cigarette or a lift, from a stranger without immediately attempting to pay  one's debt.} When such a freedom is missing, obtaining more from others isweighted only against giving more from oneself, with the resulting attempts toeither subdue others or to protect oneself against them -- in either case, the\co{alienation} of increasing loneliness.\paAt the social scale, the lack of \co{concrete foundation} results in the totalanonymity which invades the threatened and \co{alienated ego}. As\co{alienation} is the loss of \co{concreteness}, so community gets now reducedto a mass of statistically anonymous individuals. The fear of anonymityis but a \co{reflection} of the missing sense of \co{community}.\ftnt{We arespeaking about {\em both} the anonymity of a crowd of faceless units {\emand} the anonymity of \co{my} being lost in such a crowd. The two are\co{aspects} of the same anonymity.} The apparent medicine against it is \ldots success, public recognition and attention whichputs a photograph in place of the lost face. %and lost individuality.This has also a deeper aspect. Dreams of exceptional achievements, of leavingone's mark for the future development, of becomingsocially/politically/scientifically/\ldots respectable, as one's own monument inone's home town -- all such \co{egotic} thrills, which often indeed form theground for outstanding achievements, are but expressions of the \co{thirst} for\co{community} which got reduced to the purely \co{egotic} hope of establishingan exceptional, even if only ephemeral case against the background ofstatistical mediocrity. As if the most common sign of mediocrity were notexactly the dream of not being mediocre, of being exceptional. To be exceptionalis \co{ego}'s only dream, its degenerate expression of the \co{thirst} forbecoming \co{self}.  Although such dreams express the need to confirm uniquenessof one's \co{ego}, their second bottom is \co{thirst} for \co{community} -- forthe confirmation of uniqueness can for \co{ego} happen only by way of thepublic, \co{ego} must become a \la{persona} (in the sense of Jung), as itmistakes the common universality for its lacking \co{concreteness} and publicrespectability for its lacking self-respect.The anonymous crowd, which an individual confronts instead of a meaningful\co{community}, is not a simple result of the increased numbers, of the masspseudo-culture which flattens and deindividualises the social sphere. It israther the other way around -- the anonymous mass confronts individual whodwells exclusively at the level of his \co{ego} and, consequently, loses the\co{concrete} sense of belonging to a \co{community}.\ftnt{We are not trying to  negate the statistical prevalence of negative and alienating effects of  various social diseases, like inhuman working forms, depersonalised public  sphere or its spiritual emptiness. We would perhaps suggest that, to begin  with, such forms are rather expressions of the \co{egotic} mentality raised to  the social norm.  But most importantly, alien and anonymous crowd may confront  individual under any circumstances, if only the individual reduces his life  project to the level of \co{ego}. Also under unfavorable social conditions  (like those just mentioned), it is eventually the individual himself who has  to consent to the reduction of person to \co{ego}.} The \co{unfounded  community} at the level of \co{actuality} is an anonymous crowd.%%% moralism - unfounded egotic community...?\noo{Jung's \la{anima} of this level iscompared to Faust's Helen, but she is indeed only an object offeelings which, their possible aesthetic or even romantic aspectnotwithstanding, are dominated by sexual drive.  \la{Animus}represents initiative and planned action and is often symbolised by ahighwayman, as gentle and cruel as he is smart, or else a brave,strong macho, sometimes, with a flavour of a cunning politician.}\tpa{Communication.}\co{Sharing} the \co{signs} and \co{actualities} amounts to communication. Wesay \wo{\co{sharing}} because although all \co{signs} are \co{actual} and situations are  common to more people, it does not mean that every \co{actual}situation involves and every \co{sign} is a genuine communication. The\co{unfounded} communication would be a mere transfer or exchange, and not \co{sharing}, of the \co{signs}. The\co{immediacy} of \co{signs} makes them perfectly amenable to directexchange. But communication is not an event of exchanging \co{signs}, not evenof exchanging them according to some specified rules and protocols. It is not anevent of exchanging any \co{signs} but of comprehendingthem, of recognising the \co{shared} reality through and beneath the \co{actualsigns}.Communication is a possible \co{visible} \co{manifestation} of \co{sharing}; themore we \co{share} with others, the easier and more complete is the possiblecommunication.  We do not communicate that well with bacteria or butterflies.They have quite different structure of \co{experience}; their world has few, ifany, common points with ours.  There is probably close to no overlap betweenours and butterflies'.  We communicate a bit better with cats or dogs; we andthey perceive some of the same things as obstacles, we also find in them moreadvanced expressions of \thi{feelings} than can be found in ants or butterflies.Their \co{experiences} {cut} the background along the lines sufficientlysimilar to ours and provide them with a lot of things which we too\co{distinguish} and \co{recognise.} So, perhaps after all, \citet{if a lion  could speak, we might understand him,}{WittPI}{\hspace*{-.2em}(modified)} though itcertainly would not be the same degree of communication as we can achieve withany human being. And, of course, we communicate very differently with differentpeople.  \citet{Each word means something slightly different to each person,  even among those who share the same cultural background.}{MHS}{\kilde{Jung;}p.28}This, however, in no way makes communication impossible, in fact, it is whatmakes it different from an exchange of information bits.  We can understandwords which for another mean something different because we \co{share} thereality to which they refer. Eventually, communication is like pointing andeventual answer to the question \wo{What do you mean?}, after a series ofclarifications and explanations, is simply \wo{{\em This} is what I mean, just look  {\em here}.} It is an event of narrowing down the \co{shared} horizon(of humanity, language, culture, personal experience) to the \co{actual} content and, bythe same token, of endowing this \co{actuality} with meaning -- the meaning ofbelonging to the \co{concrete} and \co{shared} horizon.Perfect unambiguity of expressions and ultimate \co{precision} of the languageis the domain of computer programming but whenever something is communicated, itcan also, at least in principle, be misunderstood. The possibility ofmisunderstanding is a necessary condition of a successful communication, that is,of conveying some meaning which goes beyond the \co{immediacy} of the \co{sign}.It is only the lack of \co{shared} background which makes \co{precision} of all\co{signs} ultimate necessity -- for where nothing is \co{shared} one can onlyexchange \co{signs}. As Wittgenstein observed, even an ostentive definitionwould be impossible without sharing enough to understand {\em what} the other isactually pointing at.  \wo{Whoever has seen, knows what I am saying} was aphrase used by a mystery-initiate when addressing others: perhaps, to avoiddivulging secretes but more probably because details would not help those whohave not seen.  We \citet{need not be surprised if only those ideas which least  belong to us can be adequately expressed in words.}{BergTime}{II\kilde{p.136}}And by \wo{adequately} one likes to mean unambiguously, \co{precisely},excluding any possibility of misunderstanding.  According to Kierkegaard, thereis no direct communication, and although he too would limit this statement tothe deeper truths of the genuine faith, we would extend it to all communication.For communication is conditioned by \co{sharing}: in its \co{presence}, manydifferent \co{signs} or words may be used, while in its absence no words willresult in communication.This remains valid through all the levels. The most intimate communication is\co{founded} in the most intimate \co{communion}.  It is only at the personallevel, and only with an individual person, that full \co{communion} is possibleand it leads to very specific ways of communicating, intentionally as well asnot, most intricate aspects.  But they are communicated not due to any univocal\co{precision}, not due to universal adequacy of the used \co{signs} --\co{signs} are here always inadequate.  Just like a \co{symbol} may seem analmost arbitrary and accidental representation of the symbolised reality, sohere too, an apparently most insignificant word, a mere look, a sheer grimace orgesture, a casual phrase, can \co{actually} carry the deepest meaning. It doesnot, however, happen because the \co{signs} somehow carry this meaning in them,but only because the possibility of this meaning is \co{shared} before it hasbeen pointed to. The art of communication does not consist in the ability tointerpret the unclear \co{signs} by narrowing their meaning to the most\co{precise} content, but rather on the contrary, in the ability to use the\co{actually precise signs} to grasp the \co{imprecise} (and often \co{clear})meaning which \co{transcends} their \co{immediacy} and which they are trying tounveil.\noo{This applies equally to any contents which, no matter how  \co{actual} and \co{precise}, always \co{transcend} the \co{immediacy} of  their \co{signs}.}\pa Wittgenstein has often asked questions like: How can I be sure thatsaying \wo{green}, I and you understand what is being said, in particular,understand the same thing? The problem is of course with \thi{the same}. Butthis problem arises only when one is committed to some form of psychologism, tosome private impressions and ideas which somehow live within one's\co{subjectivity}, and which get, rather mysteriously, transfered between themonads by words like \wo{green}.  But every event of a successful communicationis \co{founded} on \co{recognition} -- the \co{actual} and mutual\co{re-cognition} follows only the \co{recognition} of \co{shared} background.If by the meaning (of \wo{green}) we understand some intrinsic properties, someimpression or idea of greenness perceived or imagined {\em inside} one's head,then indeed, it may be impossible to be sure.  But \thi{green} is only alimit of \co{distinctions} made in \co{one}, made by you {\em and} me in {\emthe same} \co{one}. The limits may vary from person to person (just like Praguemay end at different points for different people, just like stripes of therainbow interpenetrate) but these variations retain a majoroverlap. We agree on the use of the words because we \co{share} the commonreality and structure our \co{experiences} in similar ways. (As we said earlier,I:\refp{pa:languageA}, learning a language itself contributessignificantly to, but does not determine, this structuring.) In the same way,though to a much lesser degree, we agree on the use of various \co{signs} withdogs.  Communication, \wo{this influence of one monad over another is only {\emideal}, and it can have its effect only through the intervention ofGod.}$^{\ref{ft:commGod}}$ This \thi{intervention of God} is not, however, any mysticalinterference of some magical power, but the fact of, at first, only ontological\co{foundation} in the \co{one}, of having the same \co{origin}, and then alsoof \co{concretely sharing} the same reality.\ftnt{Plotinus thus describes the  souls in their intellectual dimension: \citef{all their act must fall into    place by sheer force of their nature; there can be no question of commanding  or of taking counsel; they will know, each, what is to be communicated from  another, by present consciousness. Even in our own case here [below], eyes  often know what is not spoken; and There all is pure, every being is, as it  were, an eye, nothing is concealed or sophisticated, there is no need of  speech, everything is seen and known.}{Plotinus}{IV:3.18}}One might still wonder: we agree on the use of the words, but do we agree ontheir meaning?  \citet{With most names, we've come to know which things they go  together with from their use in speech, although we are unable to determine  what the correct meaning or understanding of them is.}{AbelardPJC}{II:\para  399. Let's only remind that in the medieval grammatical theory \thi{names}  included not only nouns but also adjectives (the identification reflecting the  corresponding phenomenon of the Latin language). It would be hard to imagine  why, in the quoted sentence, one could not allow also verbs, adverbs,  etc.\label{ftnt:latinNames}} A variant of empiricism, say \wo{linguistic  empiricism}, would attempt to reduce the latter to the former, even to replace\thi{meaning} by \thi{use}.  The more the mood of such a project seems differentfrom that of behaviourism, the more surprising is the similarity of the goalsand procedures.  \citet{Why is it not possible for me to doubt that I have never  been on the moon? [...]  But if anyone were to doubt it, how would his doubt  come out in practice?  And couldn't we peacefully leave him to doubt it, since  it makes no difference at all?}{Certain}{117/120} We certainly could but, theabsence of any observable difference in social praxis notwithstanding, could onereasonably claim that there would be no difference for the person having suchdoubts? The \thi{difference for the person} need not have anything to do withwhat the person \co{actually}, practically does.  One can deny any suchdifference for the involved person only by denying the reality of the doubt, orin a more extreme case, by claiming its impossibility, perhaps, on the basis ofthe impossibility of the private doubt and, eventually, meanings. The linguisticempiricism tries to dissolve the phantom of the extra-linguistic meaning in theinter-subjectivity of the language usage or social praxis.  But \co{sharing} ismuch more than merely obeying similar rules of social or linguistic praxis. Ifwe did not \co{share} anything, how could we even agree on the consistent use ofany rules? Just like \co{communion} requires a distance, so \co{sharing} somereality requires this reality to be \co{present}, as if independently, with allwho are \co{sharing} it.\noo{If neither of us had anything, then getting  together would not result in anything new either.} It is only because we all\co{share} most of the world (practically or impractically, \co{actually} ornot), that \co{actual} communication -- transfer of and agreement on somemeaning -- is possible and may even result in new forms of\co{experience}.\ftnt{Davidson's principle of charity, in all its variants, is  an excellent expression of this dependence of communication on \co{sharing}. A  vulgar analogy from computer communication can illustrate the point in quite  precise terms.  The transfered bits have no significance unless they are sent  and received by programs obeying some protocols which in advance determine the  scope of possible communications, as if, the shared space -- of use and  interpretation.  But even following agreed rules is not sufficient for  communication beyond mere transfer of messages. It is impossible to establish  so called \wo{common knowledge} without the assumption of a prior sharing of  some information. The idea is: you and I want to reach an agreement on the  issue \thi{$X$ or $Y$?} but so that each of us knows that we both know that we  have reached it. We do not, however, share anything except some communication  channels through which we can send messages (say, by post which, to simplify  everything, is $100\%$ reliable, though it does not guarantee any time of  delivery -- I do not know {\em when} you will receive nor that you have  received my message, unless I obtain a confirmation from you). Suppose I  prefer initially $X$ and send you the message $1:X$. Suppose you agree. I do  not know that, so you should respond, confirming $2:X$. Now I know that you  agree with me on $X$, but you do not know that I know that. So, I have to  confirm the reception of the confirmation, sending $3:X$. Now, you know that I  know, but I do not know that you know that I know. And so on. (The scenario  corresponds to theorem 6.1.1 -- in \citeauthor*{ReasoningKnowledge} -- which  precludes the possibility of achieving common knowledge of anything having  been delivered. Stronger versions, e.g., theorem 4.5.4, apply to slightly  modified situations where {\em no} common knowledge may arise, as a  consequence of complete asynchrony of the components.) Misusing such arguments  for our purposes, we could say that in the absence of initial sharing, it is  not possible to establish it either, even in the presence of most reliable  communication, understood as mere transfer of messages (whether mere bits,  pictures, \thi{mental} meanings or deepest ideas). Technically, one reaches  the fix-point of the appropriate functional (where everybody knows that  everybody knows that everybody knows that\ldots) only as the infinite limit  which, misinterpreted in practical terms, means that it is unreachable. In  short, if we do not initially share knowledge, the mere exchange of messages  will never lead to achieving common knowledge. But {common knowledge} of  agreement arises trivially if we, for instance, share the same location and  both point at the $X$ (observing each other's action) or, as is usually the  case, when we speak directly to each other. In the above example, if we  initially shared the knowledge that each message is in fact delivered after,  say, 1 minute, then 1 minute after I sent $1:X$ we would achieve common  knowledge of $X$.\noo{(These cases correspond to some form of synchronicity    which, as the respective theorem shows, makes reaching common knowledge    possible.)}}\noo{ \subpa To some extent, all such discussions depend on the definitions or,  what in practice amounts to the same, the intuitions about the meanings of the  fundamental words, in this case, the word \wo{meaning}.  In order to stay in  touch with the intuition that we sometimes say (unintentionally or even  unconsciously) something different from what we mean, that we often mean  something before we speak, or even realize what we had meant only after we  have said something (different), let us say that the meaning of a linguistic  expression is constituted by the \co{distinctions} it addresses. This is  \co{vague}, but hopefully not much more than the intuition of the meaning  itself. The addressed \co{distinctions} are, of course, addressed in different  degrees and organised accordingly. There is the context which narrows down the  possible ambiguities; then, there is the explicitly addressed \co{complex},  and behind it a possible \nexus; eventually, the \co{pure distinction}, the  mere fact of distinguishing.  The content, the possible positive  determinations of the possible meanings of an isolated phrase taken \thi{in    itself} have close to no limit. They will always depend on what is called  \wo{context}, on the set of \co{actually} addressed, \co{actual} as well as  \co{non-actual} \co{distinctions}. It may be true that there is some kernel,  kept more or less constant through all the contexts of usage. But a fixed,  constant and \co{precisely} defined meanings are as plausible as eternal  \thi{essences} of things, and identifying the meaning with such an invariant  kernel would be like looking for the \thi{essence} of a thing through eidetic  variation.  We certainly might find something in such a process but calling it  \wo{essence} or \wo{meaning} would amount to a normative definition. It is the  idea of \co{precise}, unambiguous meanings (just like earlier of similar  \thi{essences}) -- which eventually means, the idea of reduction -- which  underlies the search and has always only disappointments to offer.  }\citet{If you are not certain of any fact, you cannot be certain of the meaning  of your words either.}{Certain}{114} Allow us to reformulate it as follows:If you do not \co{recognise} any \co{distinctions}, the mere words and  their exchange will not teach you that either. Everyexpression draws some boundary, either a boundary which, to some degree, alreadywas there (as in descriptions or clarifications) or one which appears only withthis expression (as in speech acts).  The \co{meaning} arises between the \co{actual}utterance/reading of the expression and the background which acquires adetermination. The meaning of a statement, or any word, is not\co{subjective} because to be \co{meaning} it must \co{transcend} the mere  \co{immediacy} of the \co{sign}.It is not private either because, at least in principle, \co{I} am never theonly person able to recognise it. And this is the case because all boundariesare drawn in the \co{shared} reality, eventually, in the \co{indistinct}background of the \co{one}.But \co{I} may have doubts which have no consequences for others (nor, inpractical matters, even for me), \co{I} may go around meaning something which\co{I} never manage to communicate to others, \co{I} may spend half, even thewhole, life intending something which \co{I} never manage to express. If thiswere impossible, communication would be impossible also, or else, communicationwould not be a \co{reflection} of genuine \co{sharing}, would not be aconveyance of meanings but a mere exchange of labels, a mere transfer of\co{signs}.\pa Just like the \co{concretely founded} communication rests on the eventual\co{sharing} and conveys it underneath everything it \co{actually} communicates,the \co{unfounded} communication is determined by its lack, that is, theconstant fear of failure. \co{Sharing} is reduced to universality and anypossible meaning to its \co{visible} expression. One searches for some\co{actual} and common basis which, as we learn from many attempts, it isimpossible to circumscribe \co{concretely}, let alone specify \co{precisely}.The \co{idol} of \thi{rational argumentation} can serve as a commonexample.\noo{We object unreservedly against the absolutisation of rational  argumentation, and only secondarily against identifying it with the basis of  meaningful communication.} Trying to convince oneself and others that we areall first of all rational beings (whatever that means), one postulates someideal goal of rational morality consisting in the unreserved acceptance ofrational arguments. One may even insist that it recognises the dignity of humanspaying all due respect to their value -- which happens to be the same as thevalue of their rationality. Now, rationality can be a valuable aspect of one'sattitude, if only we take it in some rather vague sense, for instance, asaccepting every statement (even this one!) as having only limited validity, orelse as reacting in a manner proportional (\la{ratio}), \thi{in number and  measure}, to the actual situation.\ftnt{In this generous sense, rationalism  can be seen as a continuation of the Biblical emphasis on the importance of  the number and measure according to which all things were created, as well as  of the Homeric, and almost certainly older, tradition according to which  impersonal destinies set the inviolable limits even for the gods, cf. footnote  \ref{ftnt:Moira} in Book I.} But here we are objecting only to the \co{idol}of rationality which reduces it to the logical precision of the arguments.Let us ignore the fact that there is hardly anything, hardly any action orattitude, which could not be supported by plausible arguments. The problematicissue concerns rather {\em which} arguments one is willing to accept. Theinfinite regress appears as in most cases when \co{reflective precision} triesto make itself self-sufficient. But, certainly, in various contexts (of whichthe academia may serve as the paramount example), openness to other's argumentsis a matter of professional ethics.  In life, one can also occasionally learnsomething from listening to other's arguments.  But when raised to the level ofthe fundamental principle it becomes a caricature of genuine communication.Have you ever been convinced by an argument?  That is, convinced not in somepetty matter of the choice between well-defined alternatives, of coming up witha solution to a particular problem or a scholarly discussion, but in a matter ofsignificance, in a matter which you recognise as having existential relevance.If one believes in God, is it because of an argument?  If one does not, is itbecause of an argument? Doubtful, very doubtful. In this last case, it mayrather be because one does not find any argument, and rests satisfied with one's\thi{rationality}. Arguments in such matters come only as a \la{post factum}support for the conclusions which were accepted before the arguments started. Insuch matters, there are no forcing arguments, or rather, no sufficient reasons;at best, there are only clarifications of meanings, accounts of experience.When arguments are applied beyond the sphere of \co{precisely} defined,\co{actual} problems, they either become an intellectual game or, when takenseriously, boil down to one thing: \wo{Either you are stupid since you do not  recognise the binding force of my argument, or else you are respectably  rational and accept it.} Argumentation and persuasion, when taken to theextreme and {absolutised} are much closer to brute force than they are willingto admit.\noo{We won't mention those who see in liberal democracy \thi{the best    political system} known from history since it appeals to arguments and not  force.  How can one call the majority vote, where a vote of a professor counts  as much as that of a farmer, argumentation? How can one compare shows of  political sophistry and demagogy, or for that matter advertisement's  stupidity, to argumentative discourse?\noo{e.g. Habermas, {\em Strukturwandel      der \"{O}ffentlichkeit}, V-VI} Well, perhaps one can because they are not  so~\ldots totally different?  Blindness can be hard to distinguish from  confusion.  Did not Hegel, the incarnated spirit of reason, make similar  claims about the highest possible perfection of the Prussian state in {\em    his} time?}  Appeals to some ideal attitudes or limits, like thecommunicative reason and rationality, the {undisturbed rational communication},{tolerance for the opposing views}, etc., are unable to cover up the underlyingdisrespect for the human being -- for the {\em whole} human being. The calls toassuming a respectful attitude towards the opponents become necessary, becauseit has to be {\em added on the top} of all the arguments, like a meek tableclothcovering a dirty table.\ftnt{As always, we are addressing only the personal  aspect, not any forensic or socio-political ones. Now, giving arguments, as  seems to be done here, for the irrelevance of arguments in the matters of  ultimate concern, can face the charge of involving a self-referential  paradox.\noo{Indeed, giving such {\em arguments} would lead to a paradox.} But  we are not looking for arguments, that is, we do not attempt to prove and  convince. We are only giving an account of a view which, we believe, to the  extent it is acceptable, is so by the force of its contents and not possible,  better or worse, arguments. Which aspects of this account are taken as  arguments and which as argued for is a matter of decision. And no matter which  are chosen as arguments, they do not rest on any foundation which would be  more solid than the presented views themselves. Unlike giving arguments, which  try to reach the immovable answers to all the \thi{whys}, giving an account  leaves such \thi{whys} in a suspension. It does not unveil any  incontrovertible mechanism underlied by any logical necessity, but merely  tries to say \thi{what}, to clarify some distinctions in a \nexus\ of  interrelated \co{aspects}. }\pa A different example can be that of groups establishing and requiring the useof secret codes.  Establishing {private codes} of communication -- words,gestures, expressions which carry the full meaning only to those initiated inthe {community} -- is characteristic for lovers and close friends. Buttheir privacy is different from secrecy.  In the extreme cases of secretorganisations such {codes} are established for the purpose of hiding thesecrets as well as for the confirmation of the identity of the community and itsmembers. Secret initiation rites, secret rituals follow the clandestineoperations and hidden purposes. In many situations, secrecy may beunderstandable and even justified (as, for instance, in the cases oforganisations opposing aggression, political oppression and the like) or less so(as in the case of criminal organisations or mere fear of openness). But ineither case, the secrecy of the codes signals the broken \co{community}, theimpossibility or unwillingness to \co{openly found} the communication across thesocial, political or even personal borderlines.Secret codes, being codes, insist on the strictness of the rules -- theunambiguity of the greeting sign, the rigidity of the ceremony, theimpossibility of deviation from the predetermined sequence of acts orformulae.\ftnt{Rituals can be, of course, truly \co{symbolic} expressions of  \co{invisible} meanings, but the problem is that they are not always so, and  we are now speaking about the cases when they, having lost the \co{commanding}  power, are reduced to the mere observance of the rules.\noo{Mere \co{signs},    their possible \co{precision} notwithstanding, are usually insufficient to    distinguish clearly between the two kinds.}} The less or the shallower isthe meaning to communicate, the greater the need for rigid rules, for their\co{precision} is the last thing which may give an impression ofinter-subjectivity, of sharing anything with the others -- provided they followthe same rules!  Sick cases are extreme examples of such a reduction to thelevel of \co{egotic actuality} where the ability to follow sequences of sterileand \co{precise signs} seems the last residual of communication.  Clangassociations (\wo{real, seal, deal, heel}) or irrelevant, though possible,associations (a person sending a new year's greetings and wishing another afruitful year, ends with the wishes of good apple-year and pear-year, and thensauerkraut, and cabbage year\ldots); difficulties with abstract reasoning andthe resulting literal/specific interpretations (e.g., the proverb \wo{A bird in  the hand is worth two in the bush.} gets commented: \wo{If you are able to  catch a bird you might be able to sell him for money.}) -- all such symptomsof schizophrenia are also expressions of the communication which gets disturbedby the rigidity in following plain rules in the use of the involved\co{signs}.\ftnt{Of course, other psycho-somatic disturbances are possible, but  they do not concern us here.}  The disturbance is not the lack of a rule butthe lack of anything but the rule; it is not the lack of any meaning but thefact that the whole meaning is only the mere fact of conforming to some rule,that the content of the actually followed rule is the only discernible contentof the message.  Even more extreme example of a similar rule-rigidity is acorrect but impersonally stiff language which is spoken too perfectly and toogrammatically, as if by a person using a foreign language he learned in aclassroom; the lack of colloquiality and subtleties of emotional tone; theadequate knowledge and application of the formal rules of the language alongwith the complete lack of the idea of communication. These defects, extendingalso to nonverbal communication, characterise some forms of autism.\pa One thing is the study of languages, of their properties and structures;quite another is the obsession with Language.\noo{(As always, the observable  differences may be negligible.)} Proliferation of the disciplines and intenseinvestigations in linguistics, semiotics, logic, grammar, parsing, machinetranslation, etc., etc., can certainly prove to be invaluable. But they gainparamount relevance {\em for a philosopher} primarily when he has lost -- orsees the loss of -- the sense of any \co{community}. Language can be interestingin most circumstances. But it is becoming imperatively important when it ceasesto function properly, that is, when its \co{foundation}, the \co{community}which makes communication possible, deteriorates, when the \co{distance} to the\co{shared} reality becomes impassable because that which is \co{shared} getsreduced to that which is common and the \co{clear} meanings which might becommunicated to the \co{precise} means of communication.  All that one is stillable to hope for is \co{actual} agreement, adequacy of the \co{signs}, consensusconcerning the rules.  Fiddling with the language one hopes to improve the\co{actual} communication and thus, perhaps, to reestablish the \co{community}.But the \co{more} intense and \co{precise} are the determinations of all the\co{visible} \co{signs}, the more all the sense of \co{community} disappears inthe empty cracks between them.\ftnt{%We are not talking merely about the post-Fregean,%  and why not post-Turing, logicism and linguisticism.  We would not claim any causal relations, but observing merely some rough  simultaneities is too tempting, even if also a bit daring.  (1)~Some parallels to  such a coupling of linguisticism and the lack of \co{community} might be  discerned in Europe in the VII-th and VIII-th century: on the one hand, the  final stages of the disappearance of the Roman culture, the gradual  dissolution of the Merovingian empire, conflicts between the majordomos for  the succession after once powerful dynasty; and on the other hand, the  conviction that the nature of things are recognisable in the etymology of  their names underlying the whole of \citeauthor*{Etymologies}; Fridugisus'  linguistic arguments for the existence of nothingness (cf.  footnote~\refsp{ftnt:Fridu}); Alkuin's minuscule and struggle against  barbarian, germanized Latin; dealing at the same time with the nature of  things and the properties of their names in the encyclopedia of  \citeauthor*{Hraban}. (Even if the two last ones belong to the Carolinian  renaissance, they can be seen as continuators of the linguistic line.)%    (2)~Around the beginning of the XII-th century, the new money economy and the  Gregorian reforms began to yield the divisive and destabilizing consequences.  The reforms attacking the simony among the clerics opened up, as was claimed,  for the emergence and proliferation of the heretic movements, almost absent  since the V-th century. (Their appearance around that time does not, of  course, reduce to the effects of Gregorianism.) At the same time, the  increasing interest in  language and the study of its foundations develop into the Scholastic  grammar with its theory of supposition and, eventually, into Ockham's  nominalism vindicating language and logic to the level of ultimate  truth-bearers, along with the atomistic ontology. %    (3)~The social disintegration of the XX-th century hardly needs any comments.  It is paralleled by the fascination with the philosophy of language, also  emergence of formal languages and logic, and the  thread leading through logical positivism to analytical philosophy which  ends\ldots where it ends.  Perhaps, the ecstatic opening to \thi{otherness},  just like the personal spiritualism of the New Age (both with roots reaching  at least to the end of the XIX-th century), could be seen as a reaction  against the stiffened linguisticism and predilections for rigid formalities.  The associated cacophony of language looks like an inverted culmination of a century  long analytical attempts to heal its metaphysical sickness by\ldots capturing  and formalising its essence. Can we dare to consider it as yet another analogy?  Namely, as a similarity to the post XII-th century heresies (especially  Wyclif's but also, at least to some degree, most contestations of the time)  which postulated replacing the visible, stiff and degenerate Church and  tradition by the invisible and living church, the true community founded  directly and exclusively on the revelation of the absolute \thi{otherness} -- Bible?}\pa\imm At the lowest level of \co{immediate experiences}, \co{communion}amounts to \co{sharing} the \co{actual} moments.  With whom? It may bethe loved person, or else people who happen to be present. But it need not beanybody in particular, nobody may be \co{actually} present.  \co{Thankfulness}is \co{sharing} through \co{participation}, and every moment, even if lived inloneliness, is but a \co{gift} of the \co{transcendence}. Recognition of this\co{gift} in a single moment is the same as \co{sharing} it with others --whether \co{actually} present or not. It is \co{sharing} with others because the\co{gift}, although given to me, is not \co{mine}, is not given {\em only} tome.% \co{Sharing} in general and \co{sharing} the \co{actuality} in particular% require the \co{shared} reality and the other who also \co{participates} in it.Although \co{immediacy} does not seem to leave the space for any \co{distance},the \co{concrete} communion of the moment respects both the \co{distance} to the\co{origin} of the \co{gift} and to the other with whom it is \co{shared}.Other, in particular, requires a \co{distance}. This platitude seems to beforgotten quite often, so let us repeat -- only \co{distance} makes othernesspossible. The ultimate otherness is constituted by the ultimate\co{confrontation} (which is a form of \co{distance}). But so is another person-- he emerges as another only through and from the \co{distance} which separatesus. Only distance makes relation possible, and only distance makesbeing-together possible. The true \co{communion} can find an expression in the\co{immediacy} of a pure \thi{now} only if the \co{distance} is honestly andcarefully maintained. The sense of unity in and of a moment is possible onlywhen the \co{aspect} of the \co{distance} is retained, when one remembers that it isunity of distinct poles, when we join each other from the \co{distance} ofdistinct individualities. In fact, keeping the \co{trace} of this \co{distance}in an \co{actual} moment is itself enough to experience the unity -- at once, of\co{sharing} this very moment {\em and} of \co{sharing} its \co{origin}.  This\co{distance} and otherness, \co{present} in the \co{immediacy} of a momentwhich apparently makes it impossible, is the \co{trace} of the \co{concretely  founded communion}.Expressions of this are as varied as moments one may encounter. Let us say, it can be for instance respect for things in the\co{immediate} vicinity, within the horizon of our \co{acts}. %% \pa also RESPECT for THINGS:% \co{Openness}, the \co{recognition} of God's \co{omnipresence}, breeds respect% and love for things.  The \co{openness} means thus also to embrace and% invigorate, to let everything grow (as Aristotle would say, to let it achieve% its ultimate Good, to actualise its essence) and to take care for things which% are within the horizon of our \co{action}.%The care we take for things is not grounded in our infinite love for their\co{absolute} value, but in our love for them as \co{concrete} \co{gifts} of the\co{origin}; it is love in \co{analogical} sense, love which is but an\co{expression} of \co{communion}.  As always, telling one from another, tellingsuch a love from \co{idolatry}, is not a matter of any rules and laws, but of\co{concrete}, personal presence.  What is the ultimate good of this or thatthing?  Fortunately, there is no general answer, because if there were, ourlives would be pretty boring. Petting a cat or watering a plant can hardly beanything evil, but it may be an expression of a quiet pleasure or respectfulcare or, on the other hand, of a nagging doubt about one's likability orusefulness. In the former case the moment is \co{shared} and in the latter stolen.%, and stolen only to be passed by.\pa\label{unfoundedImCom} %--\immExclusive restriction to the level of \co{immediacy} is hardly possible. Lack of\co{concrete foundation} leaves then hardly any possibility of \co{sharing}anything.  Things and \co{objects} viewed from this level appear as arbitraryevents of pure \co{immediacy}.  Consequently, all kinds of relations betweenthem, as well as between them and the \co{subject}, are as if purely nominal,unreal, abstract, indifferent. Appropriation and minute enjoyment can beattempts to establish some \co{immediate} community. \thi{Use-and-throw}attitudes, \thi{things are for \co{me} and \co{I} do what \co{I} want with  them}, all forms of disrespectful arrogance \co{acting} from the impulse ofthe moment are \co{immediate} expressions of the \co{unfounded community}, thatis, of the lack of \co{community}.In terms of relations between people, this lack of \co{foundation} amounts toextreme atomicity, to positing every individual as a totally independent\thi{it}, \co{dissociated} from any context and influences from \thi{outside}.The other who has thus become a mere \thi{it} can be encounter  justlike other things.  Everybody may have his private goals and life, but these arenot in any way shared which means, other's life in no way affects mine.\woo{All creatures are born isolated and have no need of one  another.}{SadeAl}$^{\ref{ftnt:alienation}}$ \noo{Although it is impossible to live such an attitudecompletely, it is possible to maintain it mentally, and even to \co{experience}the surroundings and people around in this way.} \noo{The \la{animus} of the lowest level manifests itself as a \thi{muscle man},  a mere vitality of strong body.  \la{Anima} is more generously associated with  Eve, though she too, represents merely the level of instinctual, biological  relations.  }\noo{ \subsubi{Justification} \pa \citeti{The just shall live forever.}{Wisdom    of Solomon}{V:15} \co{Justification} is an \co{aspect} of \co{communion}.  Yet, although neither can ever occur without the other, they have been  \co{dissociated} in the debates of more social and even political rather than  theological character.

Its ultimate form is quieting of the \co{thirst}.  \co{Thirst} is, as Augustine says, \la{esse uelle}, an ontological thirst for  Being, that is, for \co{concrete} Being, and \co{justification} concerns  exactly one's very being, the very \co{foundation} and center of one's being.  The element of \co{transcendence}, or more specifically of \co{communion}, is  expressed in the fact that nobody can \co{justify} himself. This is  experienced even at the level of individual psychology: self-justification is  almost contradiction in terms.    We have given some examples of the attempts at self-justification when  discussing evil's impossibility of obtaining it, \refpp{pa:noJustification}.  Glorification of the intensity of a momentaneous pleasure -- which, as the  {\em all and only} good, witnesses to extreme \co{alienation} -- tries to  explain itself as simply following the laws of nature. Achievements and  successes (mostly of professional kind) function often as the surrogates of  justification in the eyes of others and, above all, of oneself. A very common  pattern of self-justification is to explain one's own actions as necessary  reactions, as mere responses to some encountered \thi{objective evil}.  The  attempts at explanation and self-justification -- inadequate and impossible as  they are easily seen to be -- witness to the \co{alienation} from which they  arise. Recourse to \co{visibles} does not help for nothing \co{visible} can  quench \co{thirst} and abolish the \co{alienation}.  \citet{He that loves    silver shall not be satisfied with silver.}{MaimoTraits}{ [after p.69]} As a  more extreme example, since more or less precluding even attempts of  self-justification, we can mention envy.  It can be easily recognised as an  expression of alienation from another whom one envies possession of this or  that. But like the other examples, this too is only an \co{actual} expression  of a deeper defeat, of a conviction (whether conscious or not) of the  impossibility; first, perhaps only the impossibility of obtaining this or  that, but then also the impossibility of filling the lack, of achieving the  ideal state, the object of one's dreams, in short, of quenching the  \co{thirst}. As the \co{actual object} of envy (and similarly, of jealousy)  begins to fill the whole horizon, so the feeling itself penetrates deeper and  deeper, enslaving gradually the wider scopes of personality.  But this  \thi{reaching deeper and deeper} concerns only the consciousness of  corruption; envy from the very beginning witnesses to the inability to  \co{share}, to the reduction of \co{sharing} to mere possession, in short, to  the \co{alienation}.  The impotence (of which the impotence to obtain the  object of one's envy is only an expression) is founded on impossibility, but  this impossibility amounts here to a search for the ultimate quietude in  something \co{visible}, in possessing the object of one's envy, in  \thi{possessing} the person one is jealous about. The order of founding might  be summarised as: \inv impossibility; \mine impotence; \act enslavement  (envy).  This deep and usually unrealized conviction of impossibility is the  same as the lack of \co{justification}, the \co{alienation} from the  \co{origin}.    Envy is \co{aware} (if not directly conscious) of this impossibility and it  will hardly ever try to justify itself. At most, it will point to the  attractive character of its object (or the person, as in case of extreme  jealousy), but even that with the recognition of the impossibility to justify  the deluge of its \co{invisible} thirst by the properties of any particular  thing. Its heart is being eaten up by the impossibility of obtaining the  object but, as a matter of fact, the worst thing which may happen is that it  obtains this object. The impotence to obtain this particular object is only an  \co{actual} image of the bottomless lack which lives its own life and cannot  be filled. Satisfaction of the \co{actual} desire makes only the underlying  emptiness more intense.    \pa Living an insatiable desire may demand a lot of strength, acting against  one's deep intentions and conscience may be the strength itself. But  \co{visible} (even though deeply hidden) strength is often an \co{inversion}  of defeat, like determination is often a \co{sign} of despair. It is only the  {\em inability} to act so, the inability to act against \co{vague    commandments} -- coming from the depths, that is, from \co{above} -- which  is the true strength.  It is only the \co{openness}, and in more specific  sense the openness to others, which strengthens by \co{justifying}.    \noo{\co{Justification}, as all \co{absolute} events, begins \co{above} the    \co{visible} world and then finds only its more and more \co{visible}    expressions.}    \inv \co{Justification} is the undeserved \co{gift} and it arises from the  \co{invisible} depths where one's soul touches the point of the \co{origin}.  It is \Yes\ which, abolishing \co{alienation}, restores the \co{sharing    communion}; \Yes\ which not only does not coincide with any \co{visible}  works, but which one will often say without even knowing it.  \citeti{I am the    Lord, [...] I girded thee, though thou hast not known me.}{Is.}{XLV:5 [We    are not concerned here with the opposition -- as unfortunate as real --    between faith and works which has gone out of proportions since the apparent    disagreements in the letters of St.~Paul and St.~James.\noo{Jas.II:17} It is    the \co{invisibility} of the event which is of primary importance here.

It is \co{communion} where the two indeed become \woo{one    in flesh.}{Gen. II:24} \co{Sharing} the whole life is much more than any  kind of association and group. When, after years, one starts reflecting the  other, the constancy starts overshadowing particular problems and dangers and  the \co{shared} space extends to even most funny details, the true  \co{community} gives the sense of \co{concrete justification} which remains  forever inaccessible to a person spending the life alone.    Only slightly different sense of \co{justification} arises from a genuine  membership in a cultural or national \co{community}. Observance of the rites  and tradition, when \co{concretely founded}, not only does not diminish one's  sense of freedom but, in fact, increases it. Although one may risk involvement  into all too legalistic elements of the traditional institutions, the ability  to reflect their commandments and intentions provides the psychological sense  of constancy and \co{justification} comparable to the personal relations.    \act At the yet more particular level, we can observe the tremendous force of  others' presence; force, we might say, of justification. A group of friends,  or even of merely common interests, justifies every member: another simply  resolves my doubts. A simple \wo{yes} or \wo{no} from another person, a  trivial gesture of agreement or disagreement, turns my private meanings into  something almost \co{objective}. My opinion on some issue may be reasonably  clear but still open to adjustments; once expressed and confirmed by another,  it changes the status, it becomes a common good, a solid, {objectified}  sediment of the \co{subjective} flux. The miracle of such an interaction  consists in that, to begin with, none of us is certain, each of us has his own  doubts; and even if the doubts are not cleared away, the mere acceptance by  the other may diminish their force, in fact, make me forget them. The arising  \thi{certainty} is, of course, only a psychological effect which, in itself,  does not make the matter either more nor less certain -- it concerns only our  {\em feeling of} certainty. (The adolescent dreams of perfection and ultimacy  of recognition exemplify the insufficiency of such associations which may, at  most, quench the merely \co{actual} feeling, but not the underlying  \co{thirst}.)  Consequently, such psychological details can easily be misused  or else lead to formation of rather unpleasant groups serving exclusively  mutual strengthening of the unhealthy tendencies of their members.  At this  level, the two \co{aspects} are, of course, \co{dissociated}. One can easily  find ways of communications without increasing the sense of justification or  vice versa. But this does not change the underlying observation that such  psychological effects remain the expressions of the close relationship --  which obtains even at the level of \co{actuality} -- between justification and  communication with others.    END \subsubnonr{Justification} }\subsubi{Freedom}%\subsub{Freedom}\label{sub:freedom}%\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{\ \ \ The founding of freedom}%%\parbox[t]{15cm}{\levels{Freedom}%%\are{necessity \& arbitrariness: spontaneous appearance of contents -- %%aestetics, Fichte}%%    {necessity \& control: manipulation thanks to understanding -- %%    rationalism}%%    {possibility: listening, context, possible dependencies -- %%    existentialism}%%    {faith, trust: everything is possible -- Shestov} }       \pa\label{pa:invfreedom} \inv % \inv--We have said in \refp{pride} that freedom is an \co{aspect} of \co{pride}.  Thiscertainly needs some qualifications.  We are dependent on various things, wehave to eat and sleep, etc. We are involved into causal relations of \co{this  world} but \ldots it in no way contradicts our freedom. For freedom is notfreedom \thi{from} every possible form of dependence but only from enslavement.Freedom which tries to establish itself as a total independence \thi{from}everything, ends up in the blind street of other self-referential paradoxes byrealizing that it is sentenced to freedom -- having proved (to itself) itsindependence, it cannot escape \thi{from} this very fact, it becomes doomed tothis fact.\ftnt{The destructive  character of such an observation relies on the combination of both the  negative freedom \thi{from} and the attempts to {\em prove} it as an  unavoidable truth. But the two easily go together.}  The attempt to riseabove, to liberate \co{oneself} \thi{from} every possible dependence is exactlythe \co{aspect} of \co{pride} for which every dependence seems a form of slavery.But finding only emptiness \co{above} the interplay of \co{visible}dependencies, the only project that remains is to keep liberating \thi{from}this, \thi{from} that, \thi{from}\ldots It is this negative freedom \thi{from},the insatiable freedom of emptiness which is an \co{aspect} of \co{pride}.Liberating oneself \thi{from} this and \thi{from} that has also the aspect ofpaying back one's debts. Having borrowed or obtained something makes one feelunfree and settling the accounts one liberates oneself \thi{from} that.  Man whoowes nothing to anybody stays cool and free, above the pettiness of daily debts,he remains remote, unaffected and~\ldots \co{proud}.  But freedom is not at all topay back all the debts -- this is simply impossible, and \co{thankfulness}amounts also to the recognition of one's infinite debt. The freer one is themore one owes, and \co{nothingness} of the \co{self}, owning \co{nothing}, oweseverything. On the other hand, some like to remember the unhappy events and days ofchildhood, complaining about the family and relatives who did not do theirdue\ldots About the society which did not and does not function to promote personalhappiness\ldots About others, met then and now, who take away one's spare time,money, possibilities of enjoyment, one's life.  So one offers one's time andenergy and imagines that others owe him something.  All such complains can seemjustified but their only work is: enslavement.  Nobody, and least of all thepast, owes anything to a free man.\pa There is the abyss of freedom, the abyss of \co{nothingness} which attractsa slave with the indeterminacy of its emptiness, like a false promise. The dreadof this terrifying attraction is the price of the freedom which, equated withemptiness, proves illusory.  The true, \co{absolute} freedom is not only topossess nothing but also to owe everything. It is equivalent to a surrender, torenouncing \co{oneself}, that is, renouncing all claims one might believe tohave, all debts others might possibly owe. It is the freedom to accept theundeserved \co{gift}, to recognise the \co{absolute} character of the\co{command}, which in particular means, the possibility one has to deny it.Having accepted it, the complete lack of \co{actual} contents leaves oneentirely free to realize it, to give it an adequate \co{actual} form. (What formis adequate, however, is too \co{concrete} a question to be addressed in suchabstract categories.) \citeti{God forces no one, for love cannot compel, and  God's service, therefore, is a thing of perfect freedom.}{Hans  Denk}{\citaft{Huxley}{ p.93}}This freedom to \co{express} the \co{invisible}, this \co{presence} of\co{transcendence} in the midst of \co{immanence}, is thus not \co{my} freedom.As all dimensions of the \co{absolute} it simply is, or is not at all, and\co{I} can at most \co{participate} in it.  To be free is to \co{forget} one'sfreedom. (Let us only remind that \co{forgetfulness} is not the same as denial,a mere slipping out of memory or simple blindness, \refp{pa:forget}.)  \yes,suspending the presumed \co{absoluteness} of \co{this world} and anchoring\co{my} being \co{above} it, makes me completely free in relation to it.  Thisfreedom is precisely the content of \co{non-attachment}, of erasing thedependence on the \co{idols}, the \co{visible} pretenders to \co{absoluteness}.It \co{founds} the thorough \co{experience} of freedom which permeates \co{my}whole being, and which is not contradicted by any problems, obstacles,restrictions at the lower levels. In a sense, it liberates one from thedependence on the \co{visible world} simply by abolishing the need to look forthe final proofs and ultimate confirmations of freedom there.% In fact, all such obstacles may then be taken as mere challenges to exercise of% freedom (although this phrase might wrongly suggest that there is any point in% \thi{exercising freedom}).This is yet another example of \co{inversion}: just like \yes\ to Godheadturns out to be the deepest \yes\ to \co{this world}, so the \co{humility} andsubmission to the higher \co{commands} is the fullest form of freedom.Freedom is  not any \thi{faculty}, any separate, empty power which could befilled with arbitrary contents, and which, by some universal law of humannature, every soul either possesses or not. It is an \co{aspect} of theuniversal possibility, which everyone may desire or detest, attempt to achieveor neglect, pray for or forget. % It is inseparably bound with the \co{invisible}% content of the \co{command}, submission to which defines it.\noo{ Freedom at the level of \co{invisibles} is no longer a freedom from ...  Although Berlin applied the distinction between the negative \thi{freedom from    ...} and the positive \thi{freedom to ...}  with respect to \co{my} freedom,  it really applies first when there is something which not only is not  \co{mine}, but which is not even relative to the categories of \co{mineness}.  \co{My} \thi{freedom to ...}, to do this or that, is but another side of the  absence of restrictions, obstacles or prohibitions which would limit this  freedom.  }\noo{ This is freedom of mystical faith, which finds itself the more free, the  more \co{clearly} it can hear and follow the voice of the higher \co{command}.  It is freedom for which everything is possible or, in any case, nothing is  impossible, the freedom of paradox and miracle, which Shestov so forcefully  opposes to the rationalism of Athens.  This is the freedom after the final  \ger{Spring} of Kierkegaard's, freedom of Abraham who does follow the  incomprehensible and paradoxical \co{command} of sacrificing his only son  although he might choose not to.  }\pa \mine % \mine--% no dreams, no entitlement\co{I} cherish \co{my} dreams, \co{my} images -- of happiness, fulfillment,completeness -- and stay \co{attached} to these \co{idols} in constant attemptsto find the \co{actual} medicine against the \co{thirst}. One will say, OK, butthese are \co{my} images and dreams, and as such they make \co{me} free from theexternal constrains. There may be some psychological truth in that, but oflittle value. For it only posits this image in order to liberate itself\thi{from} that, it tries to perform the impossible leap and get rid of the\co{externality} which is only an \co{aspect} of its very \co{subjectivity}.This may be a common image of freedom at the level of \co{mineness}, of\co{unfounded} freedom which sticking to some \co{visible idols} is at the sametime trying to escape \thi{from} any such dependency.\co{My} freedom, the \co{unfounded} freedom of this level, focusing on\co{mineness} insists on making one's own choices, on following one's own courseof actions, on being an authentic \ger{Dasein}, or else an independent\ger{\"{U}bermensch}.  But \co{mineness}, which has divided the world into\co{mine} and \co{not-mine}, is exactly the site of the negative freedom\thi{from}, independence \thi{from\ldots}\ftnt{We are, of course, simplifying  tremendously all the references here.  For instance, Nietzsche's  \ger{\"{U}bermensch} is supposed to act from the pure positivity of his own,  vital energy.  But it is still {\em his own} and the main emphasis lies on  independence, on \thi{not being concerned with others} which, somehow, remains  bothered by others being there. Every call to liberation and independence  witnesses to enslavement.}  Insisting on the independence \thi{from} whateveris not \co{mine}, what has not been freely chosen by \co{me}, it can onlyencounter deeper and deeper \thi{certitude of abyss}.  As it often happens inthe face of ultimate emptiness, this negative freedom turns around to seeksolace in the things of \co{this world} and one can indeed \citet{ask the  question if man, following the need of psychological and metaphysical bonds,  does not prefer dread over freedom.}{MannCzasy}{\kilde{p.470}} For dreadremains only as long as one is staying at a distance and does not plunge intothe abyss. Thus dread, real as it is, is only a new \co{idol} worshiped for itsbeing so deeply \co{mine} and allowing \co{me} to remain what I was. Balancingon this edge, between freedom \thi{from} this world and dread in the face ofemptiness surrounding it, is the epitome of loneliness and \co{alienation}.\wo{You are and~\ldots nobody cares} is the eventual truth of this state andthis \thi{freedom}, so throughly described in existentialist literature that ithardly needs more words.\pa %mine+ \nexus:\co{I} cherish the dreams and images -- of happiness, fulfillment, completeness-- but all these dreams are like a mist, vague and unclear, in fact, entirelycontentless, sheer ghosts. What do you dream of when you dream of happiness? Doyou ever {\em dream} of happiness? A dream seems to require an image, so perhaps youmanage to substitute this or that, but then you also immediately start tosuspect that it does not exhaust the meaning of your dream.The deepest dreams \co{manifest} \co{thirst}, they aim at the \nexus\ of \Yes,and so can be falsified by any attempt to bring them to the level of all too\co{precise}. Every image threatens with a reduction of meaning and if it is notkept at the appropriate \co{distance}, required by its origin, it becomes apretension or entitlement. For we are all entitled to happiness, and since {\em  this} is happiness (for \co{me}!), \co{I} should be entitled to {\em this}.Then \co{I} get this and so \co{I} should be happy, but \co{I} am still not. Or,perhaps, \co{I} am eventually happy but then \co{I} am not~\ldots free. And what ishappiness good for, if one is not free? But everybody is entitled to freedom,right? (human right!) so now, what does it mean to be free?Wrong questions breed wrong \co{distinctions}.  The mist of {happiness}, theghost of {fulfillment} for which we thirst, is not different from freedom. Theyare but \co{aspects} of the same \nexus. Speaking more specifically, we can saythat freedom at the level of \co{mineness} is \co{non-attachment}, is freedomfrom the slavery to \co{idols}, be they images, things or ideas, or else emptywords which despair endows with ever more \co{precise} meanings -- they are allgathered under the \co{idol} of \co{mineness}. Its ultimate and typicalexpression is confusion of freedom with \co{my} sense of being free, of freedomwith \co{my} feeling of freedom. Thus \co{attachment} trying to realize itsfreedom only engrosses itself into unfreedom.  Freedom, \co{non-attachment}, isthe total non-entitlement, which is the same as the lack of fear, that is,\co{openness} for every \co{gift}. And thus freedom is unbreakably bound withmeaningfulness which is exactly the \co{concrete presence}, \co{openness} to\co{vertical transcendence} and \co{thankfulness} for its gifts. The lack of meaningis also the lack of freedom, just like is the lack of respect.\pa \act %\act--Freedom as total independence \thi{from} causal relations of\co{this world} is an invention of \co{attachment}, of \co{attachment} to\co{this world} which tries to {detach} itself from it, which tries toliberate itself by rising above it and \ldots still stays in \co{this world},because above it, it finds only emptiness.  Causality, this muchoveremphasized notion, and more significantly the physical existence, thebody, the physiology, in short, the whole sphere of most \co{actualised}contents, does not in the slightest oppose the freedom becausethey belong to different levels of \co{existence}. But \co{attachment},reducing all that is to what is \co{visible}, can not but oppose the two; forit, if there is any freedom, it must be found exclusively within the sphere of\co{visibility}.This involves \co{reflection} over freedom into the opposition to determinism.The \co{objective} world of \co{complexes} is rational and understandable, whicheventually means, underlied necessary laws.  The celebrated problems of freewill emerge as a result of reducing human \co{existence} to the same level andconsidering it only in terms of the \co{objective complex} and natural laws. Bythe same token, the will gets degraded to the \co{egotic} ability of freelyselecting goals among the \co{objects}, \co{complexes} and constellations of theworld.  In this tradition even predestination acquires a form of determinationand one has to take recurse to various distinctions like, for instance, betweennecessity of all events when seen from the point of divine knowledge vs. theiroccurrence through free will when seen in their own nature by humanunderstanding (Boethius),\ftnt{This makes, in fact, deterministic necessity into  a mere phantom since it becomes merely a property of divine  knowledge without any influence on and relevance to human life.  Everything  happens as if there were no necessity, for God foreknows simply the results of  free choices which, in temporal terms, remain undetermined until they are  actually made: \citef{if Providence sees an event in its present, that thing    must be, though it has no necessity of its own nature. And God looks in His    present upon those future things which come to pass through free will.    Therefore if these things be looked at from the point of view of God's    insight, they come to pass of necessity under the condition of divine    knowledge; if, on the other hand, they are viewed by themselves, they do not    lose the perfect freedom of their nature. Without doubt, then, all things    that God foreknows do come to pass, but some of them proceed from free will;    [...] if they are viewed by themselves, they are perfectly free from all    ties of necessity.}{Console}{V\kilde{p.165-166}}} a related distinction ofLeibniz' between the absolute necessity (whose opposite would involve a contradiction) and the hypothetical one (which rests on God's foreknowledge andfree decision and corresponds, as a matter of fact, to the contingent events ofour world),\kilde{LeibnizDM \para 13, p.64ff}%free and rational vs. chaotic and irrational choices,the distinction borrowed from Stoics by Spinoza between free acceptance of thelaws vs. unfree because unproductive opposition to them.\ftnt{Here, one makes  any indeterminacy and freedom a mere illusion. Stoicsused the following illustration: \wo{If a dog which wanted to follow thecart were bound to it, then it would both go and be dragged after the cart,doing voluntarily what it must do of necessity; but if it did not want to followthe cart, it would still be forced to do it anyway. The same happens tothe humans.}{ \citaft{Powrot}{p.76, footnote~185.\kilde{Hipolit [my retranslation]}}}}%Necessity and determinism is the ultimately objectified image of ourlimitations, is the fact that nobody possesses unlimited power enabling him to\thi{do as he wishes}, pushed to the ideal limit. And like every ideal limit, itloses contact with the \co{concreteness} of \co{existence} and becomes only themore troubling and apparently more important, the less relevance it retains.  Infact, necessary and inviolable laws would need no observance -- this is theessence of their necessity. So confronted with them, the only remnants of freechoice would be between 1) rejection and denial, in a childish opposition to theunavoidable, or 2) resolute acceptance and obedience. As rejection of theunavoidable is irrational, true freedom must then amount to expedient use of thelaws, to the ability to manipulate and apply them.  It is freedom whichliberates \thi{from} the necessities of \co{this world} only when these can beutilised for one's own purposes. However, the more necessity, the less contentand, eventually, such laws which might be believed to apply unreservedly, getapplicable only to more and more \co{precise} and objectified contents,II:\refpf{pa:necessity}. In practice, this is the way in which money and powergive freedom of choice and action, freedom which, mixed with and constantlyopposed to the limitations imposed by the surroundings, keeps fighting for itsown sake and, at the same time, doubts its ultimate \co{foundation}.  Forovercoming various \co{actual} limitations, it suspects some fundamental one,but not finding any \co{visible} necessity, it can avoid the ultimate emptinessonly by pushing the idea of necessity further and further away from itself.% For, as nobody has ever managed to pinpoint any necessary laws for anything more% than the contentless objects of mathematics, their relevance also for the% consideration of freedom seem limited.\pa%freewillThe problem of freedom and free will is usually posed in the manner of an\co{objective} question about some \thi{matter at hand}: \wo{{\em Are} we or  {\em are} we {\em not} free?} \wo{{\em Is} our will free or {\em is} it {\em    not}?} Also such questions lead naturally to what onewould consider the \thi{real}: the physical world, causality, the natural laws-- these give at least a context for speaking about that which \thi{is}, and\thi{from} which one might be free.  But such questions have only wrong answers.If one says no, all common-sense objects forcefully, if not scholarly.But if one answers yes, gives reasons and arguments showing that, indeed, we{\em are} free, then one gets immediately captured into the necessity of thisanswer which makes one unfree with respect to the (now necessary) law offreedom.  However, freedom is not any fact but an \co{existential} possibility,it is not given, it is not something everybody has or, as the case may be, doesnot have.We have, perhaps, liberated ourselves from this mode of speaking, but still, dowe not hear, occasionally, talk about the \thi{problem of freewill}?  It can, indeed, be made into a tremendous problem.  Here \co{I} am, in\co{this world}, determined by the laws of nature, and yet \co{I} can choose todo this or that, \co{I} do have a definite feeling that \co{I} have free will.But do \co{I}?  How is it possible in the world, of which \co{I} am a part,which is just a clockwork.  OK, we do not believe in this clockwork any more.  Astone which hypothetically thinks that it is endeavoring to further its motionas much as it can, a compass needle which desires to move north and opines thatit turns itself independently of another cause, or that dog of Stoics which,desiring to follow the cart, was also bound to it so that it followed it bothvoluntarily and under compulsion\kilde{Powrot,p.76,ftnt.185} -- these images donot exercise such a strong influence on our sense of relevance, because the underlying ideaof an inescapable mechanism is not so convincing any more. We do not believe in this clockwork any more but we haven't gotanything else to believe in instead. Although we, everybody with \co{his} will, are nolonger confronted by (an image of) a deterministic clockwork, the doubtsconcerning freedom seem to persist. The world, perhaps, is a bit more indeterminate than a clockwork, but thequestion still remains: {\em am} \co{I} free?Reduced to the level of \co{actuality}, freedom becomes only freedom to chooseone course of \co{action} rather than another -- one asks if the choice is madefreely, if the will is free. Will is \co{mine}, it is something \co{I} have, not something \co{I} am; thatis, it is an \co{aspect} of \co{ego}, in fact, the fundamental \co{aspect} emphasized always by every \co{egotic} being or culture.  As\co{ego}, so also will is involved into the interplay of all \co{visible  distinctions}, and all possible relations between them. Trying to liberateitself \thi{from} the \co{visible} laws of the \co{visible world}, it has onlyemptiness of indeterminacy and arbitrary choice left.  But replacing natural,perhaps even necessary laws by some stochastic processes, by indeterminate lawsof social interactions, by Heisenberg's principle, does not change the leastthing, no matter how much one would like to believe that indeterminacy of theworld is more pleasing to one's freedom than its necessity would be.Meaninglessness is an aspect of unfreedom and increasing the indeterminacy ofthings does rather the opposite than what one would like to believe.\noo{Did themodern preachers of freedom ever managed to preach anything more thanmeaninglessness?} It is doubtful if anybody reading Camus, Beckett or Sartre is able todiscern any sense of freedom, of genuine freedom.  Their free will choosesperhaps freely, that is arbitrarily, but it also seems strangely unfree,captured somewhere between \la{nausea} and Sisyphean heaviness.\noo{So, perhaps,reading Nietzsche? The need, the intense need of \co{attachment} to overcomesomething, is but the need to deny it, is but an expression of will strained bydisrespect.\ftnt{You will be able not to misinterpret this. Of course,  \co{I} can act in \co{this world} for various purposes, \co{I} can try to  achieve various goals and this does not, by itself, mean that \co{I} am not  free. What makes me unfree is when something becomes unbearable so that \co{I}  {\em have to} achieve some goals, when something {\em has to} be changed, when  the arrangements of \co{visible things} are \co{experienced} as all and only  ground determining my freedom.  But freedom has nothing to do with arranging  things in a manner which would be comfortable and pleasing to \co{my} will.}-}Identifying freedom with the freedom of %will in making choices amounts to a tremendous reduction of the idea to the momentaneousquality of a single \co{act}. The shadow of arbitrariness, which always appearsin the background of such discussions, is only to be expected.  Do we reallywant to reduce freedom to such \co{actual} choices? Any \co{actual} decisionconcerns only more or less petty matters, and the more we insist on deciding\co{ourselves}, the pettier we become. Is one's freedom the freedom to decidewhether one will have an ice-cream or a chocolate?  Is this freedom we want tospeak about? Is this freedom? The issue is not to decide oneself but to deciderightly, and freedom of choice has close to nothing to do with that.%What matters is the choice, not freedom.Free choice of free will might seem to ensure that \co{my ego} manages to detachitself from \co{this world}. Perhaps. But detachment is only a form(\co{inversion}) of \co{attachment}, a despair capable of nothing more thannegation.\ftnt{This is the constant association of the theme of freedom and  {liberation from this world} with the variants of detachment and abnegation,  whether in the original Orphic and Platonic, then Manichean, Gnostic and  Cathar type, or more modern kinds, of which Heidegger and later  existentialists are the prime example. Shestov's aggressive opposition of  Jerusalem's faith to the reason of Athens' would also fall into this  category.}In fact, \co{I} would probably feel much more unfree in a completely chaoticworld, facing the \thi{certitude of the abyss}, than in the world of Newton, oreven Laplace.  Such a world, fully determined by causality (or other law), isonly an image and freedom does not amount to overcoming causality or otherpossible determinations of our \co{acts}. Various \co{acts} in varioussituations may be performed under various coercing factors. In fact, \citet{[n]o  one wills what he can will because he can, without some other cause  [...]}{AnselmFall}{27} But this does not change the fact that most importanthuman \co{acts} have no discernible, \co{visible} causes -- for causality, asKant teaches, is a category of mere \co{actuality}. (This does not mean that\co{acts} are indeterminate and arbitrary -- they may not be caused, but theyare almost always \co{motivated}.)  \co{Experience} of a free (that is,\co{motivated}, and not arbitrary) choice is irrefutable, and so determinismmust ignore \co{experience} and appeal to some \thi{deeper} aspects, possibletheories, splashy images, hidden mechanisms, future investigations\ldotsConsequently, possible perhaps as it in principle might be, it remains sincemillennia a mere postulate -- the postulate to figure out all the sufficient anddetermining causes.\pa %\act+\co{Non-attachment} is freedom from \co{attachment} but it is notfreedom \thi{from} \co{this world}. On the contrary, it is preciselyfreedom to live and act {\em in} \co{this world}.\co{Actual} freedom is not liberation \thi{from} things and their order butrespect for them, that is \co{thankful} acceptance. Because one no longer values any of the \co{visible} things as \co{absolutes},that is, does not expect them to quench the \co{thirst}, one can acceptthem, whether they are one way or another.  \noo{ In the most general sense,  they are the way they are not because \co{I} or somebody else have made them  so, but because this is the way they are.  Except for the narrow horizon of  things close-at-hand which \co{I} can control, the most of natural as well as  human creatures have to be left in peace the way they are.  To try to bring  them in conformance with \co{my} wishes and whims, OK, with \co{my} true,  meaningful and deep goals, is not only a futile \co{attachment} -- it is an  idea which may only lead to disappointment, even despair.  }%Accepting things is very different from surrendering to them. Acceptance meanshere the same as respect. One does not require explanations, reasons andarguments, which is precisely to say: one respects things.  They run theircourse, they may have their logic and it may be highly rewarding to study theirways and to inquire into (not require) their reasons. One's freedom is the freedomto do this.  Arranging them according to one's wishes and likings are butpetty consequences which may be useful but which have nothing to do with freedom.  Freedom, true freedom, is freedom to respect \thi{the order of  things}, for \wo{no Thing is contrary to God; no creature nor creature's work,  nor anything that we can name or think of is contrary to God or displeasing to  Him, but only disobedience and the disobedient man.}$^{\ref{ftnt:obedience}}$Disobedience is but another word for \co{attachment}; \co{attachment} whichworships instead of respecting, and thus remains enslaved in the midst of itssearch for liberation. Just like one \co{actuality} excludes another, so one\co{idol} opposes and tries to avoid or defeat another.  Any attempt to escapefrom this or that, and the eventual form of the attempt to liberate \co{oneself}\thi{from} the whole order of things and \co{this world}, is an expression of\co{attachment}, of an involvement which makes \co{this world} the onlyreference frame, of the underlying feeling of enslavement which sees its onlyalternative in negation, in \co{detachment}. \thi{Use-and-throw} attitudes,\thi{things are for \co{me} and \co{I} do what \co{I} want with them}, all formsof disrespectful arrogance are expressions of un-freedom (just as they wereexpressions of the lacking \co{communion} in \refp{unfoundedImCom}).  Also, an\co{inverted} attitude, the Stoically resigned \thi{acceptance of the world}, therealization that one can not oppose \thi{the whole world} and that thereforeit is wiser not to fight against it but humbly accept whatever it brings\co{me}, is an expression not of freedom and wisdom but of defeat and surrender.It may look like respect but, typically, it will be a mere servility, a mereobservance of all rules, regulations, customs.  Although there is nothing wrongwith all that in itself, it often carries at its bottom the feeling of unfreedomwhen it is a mere \co{act} within \co{this world}, a mere defeat in the face of\co{visibility}, that is, when it is not \co{concretely founded} in the higherfreedom.\pa \imm %\imm--Freedom viewed from the level of \co{unfounded immediacy} is hardly anythingmore than arbitrariness of appearances.  This seems to be the character freedomacquires in some forms of idealism, for instance in Fichte's Ego, and it isquite explicit in Sartrean \thi{for-itself}.  The ideal \co{immediacy} of anequally ideal \co{subject} leaves no room for anything except spontaneousproduction, positing, apperception, appearance of arbitrary contents.  The onlyalternative, in which thinking such \co{immediacy} inevitably gets itselfinvolved, is between the contents being posited by the \co{subject} or elsebeing completely independent from it.  Even the laboriously reworked by thecategories of understanding contents of Kantian sensations are, eventually,arbitrary elements confronting the subject occupied with its transcendental --and atemporal only because momentaneous -- activities.  The sense of freedom,whether on the side of the \co{subject} or \co{object}, is just the spontaneousemergence of contents. It is but a reflection of the \co{reflective act} which,\co{dissociating} its \co{object} from itself and from all the \co{rest},\co{posits} it in the \thi{freedom} of arbitrariness.\ftnt{We would probably not  impute Fichte, and certainly not Kant, such a concept of freedom. We only  identify the presence -- and significance -- of such an element in their frameworks.}Some \oo\ feelings which might be related to such an idealized perspective wouldpresent me with the \co{actual} situation as absolutely indeterminate.  Theworld seen as a chaotic collection of isolated entities, as a pure play ofchance and arbitrariness, the alien and alienated world to which onenevertheless still feels some form of belonging and which one would like to seein an attractive, positive manner, in short, a deep existential crisis, may leadto such a perception of freedom.  One day man will go mad to prove that he isfree -- as Dostoevsky prophesied.\ftnt{\citef{If you say that all this, too, can    be calculated and tabulated -- chaos and darkness and curses, so that the    mere possibility of calculating it all beforehand would stop it all, and    reason would reassert itself, then man would purposely go mad in order to be    rid of reason and gain his point!}{Underground}{I:8}} Mad minuteness is onlya step from minute madness which collapses the whole world to \co{immediate}proximity.  Arbitrary spontaneity of such an isolated moment is the last resortof apparent freedom left to a slave who had to escape that far.The arbitrariness of all the events and complete lack of control over themprovide the grounds for denying that they have any value, that bad is as good --since equally arbitrary -- as good, that my only role is to confront and acceptwhatever is encountered. Let this description not mislead us -- it might almostapply to the attitude of \co{thankful} acceptance. The difference is thatarbitrariness levels and equates all things because they have lost all meaningand become equally empty, while \co{thankfulness} accepts all things stilldifferentiating and even choosing between them. As most thinkers, not only ofthe rational school, always maintained, freedom requires a rational element --it is not an arbitrary choice (which is only the other side of meaninglessness)but one \co{concretely founded} in the higher sphere of \co{motivations}.\pa %\imm+Freedom, \co{founded} freedom of any \co{act} is \co{rest}, is its anchoring in{\em all} the higher levels of being.  An \co{act} of will is still only an\co{act}, and the sense of its freedom amounts to the degree of its\co{dissociation} \thi{from} the causal dependencies which, eventually, meanssimply the degree of its \co{dissociation}.%\thi{from all the rest}. But the constitutive quality of an \co{act} is its very limitation to the \hoa,its \co{dissociation}.  Thus every \co{act} carries with it this sense offreedom. This sense, however, has no direct implications for the freedom of the\co{act} which is almost its exact \co{inversion}: the \co{concrete} anchoringin the \co{transcendence} as opposed to a \co{dissociation} from it.  There isno such thing as a \thi{free \co{act} in itself}, for a free \co{act} is simplyan \co{act} of a free person, an \co{act} \co{founded concretely} in the freedomof \co{existence}.In one of the most cruel situations of enslavement, when ten prisoners areselected to be tortured to death for the absence of one person at the roll call,a lucky, unchosen man steps forth and asks to exchange the places with one of theselected men. Thus died St.~Maksymilian Kolbe in Auschwitz, while the man whose lifehe saved survived the war.  No situation deprives man completely of thepossibility to choose, that is, to \co{act}. The situation in which one, say,has to lie or be killed may not have been chosen voluntarily, yet the choice ofthe alternatives remains. \citet{Therefore although he either lies or is killed  unwillingly, it does not follow that he lies unwillingly or is killed  unwillingly.}{AnselmFreeWill}{V. The argument recurs also, e.g., in  \citeauthor*{AnselmConcord}{VI}. (This observation is expressed in (most)  modal logics as non-distributivity of modalities over disjunction.)}  All tooelaborate comments on the choice of Kolbe's would be inappropriate but a fewwords should be allowed. It may serve as an example of an \co{act} of ultimatefreedom and, by allowing also others to retain the faith in its possibility, ofliberation.  If we were to call it an \wo{act of being-towards-death}, we wouldhave to emphasize that it is not any \thi{directedness} towards death andnothingness, cherished for their liberating ultimacy, but only preparedness fordeath, a true sacrifice choosing something one does not want, and choosing it inthe name of something which transcends infinitely any \co{actual} aspect of thesituation.\ftnt{Schopenhauer's definition of a saint as one who does nothing he  would like and everything he does not like, is certainly exaggerated, but need  not be dismissed completely.} Freedom of such an \co{act} is anchored in theknowledge of its extreme consequences and their full acceptance, i.e., thecontinued ability to put up with them.  Choosing thus what one does not want tochoose, consenting to what one does not want, effects an \co{inversion}, for bychoosing death Kolbe really chose freedom.  There may be situations where theonly free choice is Hobbson's choice, the choice of (or the consent to) the onlyalternative of death. In such situations, the inability to sacrifice one's lifemay make this life not worth living. In fact, man seems the less willing tosacrifice his life, the less worthiness his life contains.\ftnt{An example of an  attitude opposite to the one just mentioned is well documented by Tadeusz  Borowski in the stories and novels from his time as a kapo in concentration  camp. Few years after the war, he committed suicide.  The concentration camp  syndrome (corresponding to PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder, in more  recent psychiatric classifications) originates with the exposure to  exceptional cruelty and is not related to victim's premorbid personality  (e.g., \citetit{Eiti}).  The very high prevalence of PTSD in the concentration  camp survivors, about 85\%, still leaves 15\% which were not so severely  affected.  Perhaps, the difference could be referred to the difference between  giving up any resistance or else attempting survival for {\em any} price, on  the one hand (yes! both these are on the same side), versus being prepared to  die, as many did, preserving some dignity.  \citef{Survival in the camps [...]    depended foremost on luck: to be able to survive, one had to escape being    killed by SS. [...] If he was not murdered, how well a person was able to    survive depended on how well he managed to maintain if not some of his    autonomy, at least some of his self-respect and meaning his relations to    others had for him.}{Bettel}{p.108\kilde{cudowne i pozyteczne...p.36}}  Grzesiuk, who survived 5 years in various extermination camps, notes that he  \citef{who wanted to survive must not have been afraid of death, for everyone    who wanted to live and was afraid of death -- was afraid of being exposed to    beating and executed dutifully all the commandments, awaiting a miracle and    the end of war or that they will release him and that he will get through.    When he realized that he was getting close to the end, it was too late and    for such a one there remained only crematorium.}{Grzesiuk}{Preface} From the  \co{egotic} perspective of a free choice, the ones like Borowski chose as  freely (or unfreely) as those like Kolbe or Grzesiuk. But we would insist that  while the latter remained free, the former did not, and the distinction has  nothing to do with the way they made the choice but only with {\em what} they  chose.}%, and so some \co{acts} (free) are impossible without freedom...A less tragic (because leading eventually to the survival) but more dramatic(extending over several years) example of the choice of preparedness to die isillustrated by the following.  \citet{We carried soil in wheelbarrows, bringing  it from some fifty meters all the time running at the very edge of the stone pit. The wallwas some tens of meters high and was here quite perpendicular. Running wecarried the soil and kapo was running along with us, beating us with the stickin the shoulders, hands, heads, faces. [...] After some minutes I realized thatI won't manage a whole hour. He will kill me -- I thought. Good, but you too,bastard, will get killed and I will have greater pleasure going to heaven insuch a company. Kapo was short. I decided to catch him when he gets behind meand fall back. If everything goes fine, we both flutter down to the bottom ofthe pit, and there it stops, the end.}{Grzesiuk}{III. Mauthausen;p.95-96}The examples are intentionally so extreme because they clearly illustrate that freedom is not at all the matter of the \co{external} situation. Although somesituations, contexts, political systems will make free \co{acts} more difficult,and the feeling of freedom almost impossible, it is neverthelesspossible even in the most extreme cases which one might want to classify as the worstexamples of unfreedom.  \co{My} freedom is not liberation \thi{from} the\co{actual} dependencies but the way of handling such dependencies. Mostimportantly, \co{actual} freedom of \co{acts} and \co{actions} is not anyintrinsic property of them, but the fact of being \co{concretely founded} in thefreedom of the person. Thus \co{founded} freedom is indistinguishable from themeaningfulness of its being, which lends its meaning and \co{motivation} to the\co{actual} situations and performed \co{acts} -- every \co{act} and, inparticular, the free \citet{act of meaning is related to the unconditionedmeaning viewed as an abyss of meaning.}{TilRel}{I:1.1.e}\sep\pa\noo{There is, in short, no such thing as \thi{the problem of freedom initself}.}Freedom is not a roving of a vagabond damned on selecting among arbitraryalternatives but, on the contrary, the ability to select -- or what amounts tothe same, accept -- the right alternative.  True freedom is only an \co{aspect}of the \nexus\ of \yes, is being where it is best to be. For \citet{one who is  as he ought to be, and as it is expedient for him to be, such that he is  unable to lose this state, is freer than one who is such that he can lose it  and be led into what is indecent and inexpedient for him.}{AnselmFreeWill}{I} The question is not if one, by a universal decree of human nature, by a solidand undeniable, natural or unnatural law, is free or not, if one's will choosesthe ice-cream because of one's upbringing, social dependencies and digestiveproblems or else just because it chooses so, in a complete indeterminacy ofemptiness.  The question is if one, by the power of one's {spirit}, is able tolive the apparent paradox of submission to the contentless \co{command}, andthus become worthy of receiving freedom from \co{above}. \co{Actual} freedom isbut a side-effect, an aspect of \co{love}, of submission to the \co{command} andthe resulting \co{non-attachment}.  If this sounds like a contradiction then weare pleased -- as far as freedom is concerned, this will suffice.\subsubi{Responsibility}Let us close this list of examples with a seemingly lesser and more modestissue: responsibility. We touched upon this in connection with the original sin in\ref{sub:privativum}.\refp{pa:originalSin}, footnote~{\small{\ref{resp}}}. %p.\pageref{resp}. Genuine responsibility is the \co{actual} attitude of response to the highervoice. When this \co{trace} is followed all the way to the \co{absolute origin},responsibility coincides with what the theological tradition called\wo{obedience to God's will} and what we have recognised as \co{humility}.\pa\label{pa:respInv} \inv % Responsibility here is the same as \co{community} and \co{sharing}; % there is no question about any choosing and willing at this level.% participationWe have said, \refp{pa:originalSin} and \refpf{pa:originalSinII}, that theoriginal sin is neither willed nor deliberately committed and thus,technically, it is not a personal sin. Yet, as we share in thepenalty for the original sin without personally sharing in the sin itself, many\noo{, for instance Abelard,} maintained that one may have to endure punishments which one has not merited.% We share in the original sin, if not in any more specific way, then at least in% carrying the responsibility for it.We might exaggeratedly say that one is responsible even for sinking into the mudof despair -- not because one can do something specific and avoid this sinkingonce it started, but because one is still responsible fortaking up the challenge of not accepting the \co{visible} impossibility ofrelief, that is, of accepting its \co{invisible} possibility.We can exaggerate even more than that.  As a form of sickness of \co{existence}which loses its \co{concrete foundation} in the \co{absolute}, the original sin(in our sense) is evil and for it, like for any other evil, we are responsible.Responsibility, as a response to the \co{absolute}, is simple non-acceptance ofany evil, of \co{alienation}. In this sense, everyone is genuinely responsiblefor {\em all evil and all sins} which are committed, not only for those whichone has committed oneself. \citet{Every man who sins, sins against all people and  every man is to some degree guilty of another's sin.}{Devils}{At Tichon's  II\kilde{p.699}}It is unacceptable to all manner of thinking involved into any form ofsubjectivistic reduction -- of sin and guilt to feeling of sin and guilt, offreedom to unconstrained voluntary choice, and eventually also ofresponsibility to such a choice.% (where, by the way, \thi{freedom} can appear only as arbitrariness,% since every meaning carries with it a \thi{threat} of external authority). But we are responsible not only for what we choose but also for what we are; notonly for the \co{subjective acts} of choice, but also for choices which we live,even though they were madebefore and \co{above} us; not only for what we could somewhat, voluntarily andactively repair but also, even primarily, for all that we can not.  One resistssuch a responsibility, firstly, because it seems to restrain one's sense offreedom and, secondly, because it cannot possibly be put into any specificaction. With regard to freedom we have just seen that it amounts to\co{openness} to the \co{communion} and not to fortifying oneself behind thewalls of private choices. And this apparently \thi{empty} and\thi{unproductive} sense of responsibility \thi{for everything} (which is justanother side of the deeper sense of guilt, not intended nor actively caused andyet committed), could be equally well characterised as sympathy and fellowfeeling for everything, as a mere compassion with all the victims, a mererecognition of the evil which met them, and as repentance for evil as such -- as \co{love} of universal \co{communion}. Regarding  \thi{unproductivity}, let us quote Scheler's response to the same accusationagainst repentance: \citet{The jovial gentlemen say: Do not repent, but design  good projects and do better in the future! But the jovial gentlemen do not say whence the strength for designing good projects and even more for their execution should be fetched, if no prior  liberation and self-empowerment of the person,  through repentance, against the determining power of the past takes place.}{MaxReue}{p.36.\orig{Die jovialen Herren gar sagen: Nicht   bereuen, sondern gute Vors\"{a}tze fassen und Zuk\"{u}nftiges besser machen!  Aber dies sagen die jovialen Herren nicht, woher die Krafte zum Setzen der  guten Vors\"{a}tze und noch mehr die Kraft zu ihrer Ausf\"{u}hrung kommen  soll, wenn nicht die Befreiung und die neue Sichselbstbem\"{a}chtigung der  Person durch die Reue gengen\"{u}ber der Deteminationskraft ihrer  Vergangenheit vorher erfolgt ist.}} Strangely enough, strength to carry out\co{actual} tasks is an \co{inversion} of \co{humility}, and increasesproportionally to the latter, \refp{pa:humbleStrong}. %I carry responsibility for your wrongful acts.The universal scope of this responsibility, surpassing any particular\co{actuality}, is a \co{sign} of continuity between the \co{actuality} and its\co{invisible origin}.  This form of responsibility may be different from whatis commonly, let alone legally, understood under this name, but responsibilityit is nevertheless (if not in other way, then simply by \co{founding} any\co{active}, \co{visible manifestations} of responsibility.)  Refusing it, onebreaks the continuity of Being, reduces \co{oneself} to mere \co{subjectivity}and the \co{communion} to mere association. And every \co{spiritual} reductionis a form of \co{alienation}.  \noo{eventually, of evil.}  \noo{ In a sense, it  is responsibility with no consequences; like every \co{spiritual aspect}, it  does not imply any specific feelings nor require any specific actions. But it  involves one is a special form of being. This responsibility is more l. It  coincides with the highest degree of \co{humility} in which, according to the  rule of St.~Benedict followed here also by St.~Bernard, compassion bewails  one's faults and blemishes which, in a sense, are {\em all} the faults and  blemishes.  }% Here it is the sense of responsibility even for things I have% not done or committed, for all the sins of the whole world, the sense of% compassion and regret for the sins which are committed -- not related to my% active and voluntary acts, but to what happens\pa \mine In a more specific sense, \co{I} am responsible for \co{my} whole lifeand, as strangely as above, also for all the evil which affected me. For even if it is not accepted voluntarily,it affects me only if I consent to it -- consent, perhaps, by not seeinganything, perhaps, by seeing in it no evil, perhaps by giving up the resistanceto it -- in either case, even if not accepting voluntarily so stillaccepting. More precisely, I am responsible not for the evil which affects me as such, but for the fact {\em  that it affects me}, that it affects me {\em as evil}. %Eventually \co{my soul} is the only place where evil can Herein lies an important difference between various people not only reactingdifferently but also developing differently under apparently quite the samecircumstances. Eventually, \co{I} -- and only \co{I} -- am fully responsible forwhat \co{I} have become -- blaming the society, school situation, familyconflicts, and what not, may have some merit {\em only in so far} as the\co{objective} improvements of the respective social contexts are concerned.Being exposed to evil influences is not a sin but one sins very easily by anirresponsible response to such an exposure, a response by which one damagesoneself or, what amounts to the same, finds inexcusable evil in the world whichone makes responsible for the evil which infects one's \co{soul}.Irresponsibility, whether inability to \co{recognise} one's responsibility orescape from it, is thus not only escape from suffering but even from thingswhich are seen as its source.  It is a \co{sign} of broken \co{communion}, an\co{aspect} of enslavement by evil -- eventually, the \co{posited} evil -- ofthe world. In the ultimate form of such an \co{ingratitude} men accuse God forhaving created or allowed all these evils and \citet{lay blame upon [...] gods  for what is after all nothing but their own folly.}{Odyssey}{I:32} Yet,through such a distancing oneself from the evil and responsibility for it, oneonly deepens \co{alienation} from oneself. For one thus forgets that God acts{\em only} through one's soul, that \citeti{[a]ll works are performed by warmth,  [and] if the fiery love of God grows cold in the soul, the soul will  die.}{Eckhart}{\btit{German Sermons}, Lk.VIII:54.

It is responsibility of a response to the call ofconscience, a response to the \co{command} reminding one about the suffering --one's own or others' -- hearing which and remaining indifferent would amount toa consent.  Of course, we do not suggest that the \co{communion} expressed inthe sense of responsible compassion with all suffering should be brought to thelevel of \co{actuality} in the same universal form.\ftnt{Such constancy of the  sense of guilt and repentance without any accompanying shrinkage of  personality or decrease of energy is probably as seldom as holiness. An  average human being can stand only some amount of suffering (whether one's own  or others') and when this limit is passed, the reaction is a withdrawal:  \wo{I can't stand it any more. We are not created for {\em this}.} It is the  natural sense of entitlement which gets contradicted and attempts to protect  itself. The saintly person, on the other hand, does not live his \co{attached}  entitlement but his \co{thankfulness} which does not pick on the offered  \co{gifts}. This \co{openness} to everything, including suffering, is  sensitive to all kinds of \co{ingratitude}, that is, guilt. And  thus,  \citef{[it belongs] to the increase of humbleness and holiness in man that --    as life testifies to the most holy -- the sense of guilt gets functionally    {\em refined} accordingly to its [guilt's] objective decrease and that    thence even lesser misconduct is heavily experienced.}{MaxReue}{p.48} \orig{[Es geh\"{o}rt] zum Wachstum der Demut und Heiligkeit in Menschen,    da{\ss} -- wie das Leben aller Heiligen bezeugt -- das F\"{u}hlen der Schuld    gerade mit ihrer objektiven Abnahme sich funktionell {\em verfeinert} und    da{\ss} daher immer geringere Verfehlungen schon schwer empfunden werden.}}In every \co{actual} situation challenging one's compassion, and hence alsoresponsibility, one has to weight the possibilities of \co{actually} followingthe call against multitude of other factors.  Even if all such factors preventone from \co{actually} doing anything specific, the mere compassion with theneedy ones is also an expression of responsibility. (Solon asked \citet{what  should be done to make people commit as few crimes as possible, answered that  also those who did not suffer from the crime, should be as much moved by it  as those who were its victims.}{DiogenesL}{I:2\kilde{p.40}})Irrespectively of situation and other factors, one carries full \co{actual}responsibility for {\em everything} one does and everything one leaves undone.The question may only concern the degree of this responsibility and itsconsequences.%This \co{actual} responsibility for one's \co{acts} and deeds is not somethingone may assume or not assume, but something that follows from their\co{foundation} in one's being and its \co{communion}.  Ultimately,responsibility is simply the fact of, on the one hand, ontological\co{foundation} and, on the other hand, of the influence of the lower levels onthe higher ones. The first \co{aspect} concerns the \co{actual} responsibilityfor everything one has done and is doing, also for avoiding or removing theconsequences of the evil which affected one. Having done something blameworthy,one may point to being temporarily unconscious, affected by drugs or childhoodtrauma, but no such excuses provide a complete justification.  Eventually, oneis responsible for what one is, and {\em everything} one is doing is a\co{manifestation} of that. In the most trivial situations, saying \wo{I am  sorry}, one is not sorry for one's bad will and intended acts but exactly forsomething one has done {\em without} intending it, for something which merelyhappened {\em through} one. \wo{I am sorry} not for intending to collide withanother person but for the very fact that I did not notice him {\em and} runinto him.  This is the \co{actual} responsibility for my past.\ftnt{Agamemnon  admits: \citef{it was not I that did it: Jove, and Fate, and Erinys that walks    in darkness struck me mad when we were assembled on the day that I took from    Achilles the meed that had been awarded to him.  What could I do? All things    are in the hand of heaven, and Folly, eldest of Jove's daughters, shuts    men's eyes to their destruction.}{Iliad}{XIX:86ff} But this workings of  Folly (or as others translate it, infatuation, momentaneous loss of control)  is not cited by Agamemnon as any excuse; higher forces have been at work, but  they worked through him: \citefib{I was blind, and Jove robbed me of my    reason; I will now make atonement, and will add much treasure by way of    amends.}{Iliad}{XIX:137}\kilde{Dodds discusses more}} The other \co{aspect}is directed towards the future, is responsibility for what one becomes. Itamounts to the fact that everything one does, every \co{actual} project and\co{act}, may with time seem to disappear from the \co{actual} memories, but itnevertheless contributes to the \co{virtual} seeds of one's \co{soul}. Althoughthe exact measure of this contribution and its eventual consequences are onlyseldom possible to discern, its very fact is hardly disputable,II:\ref{sub:lowHigh}.  In this sense, every evil done, increasing the\co{alienation} of the \co{soul}, breeds its own punishment. The call to takingup responsibility for this evil amounts to the call of conscience and, followingit, to repentance and voluntary atonement.\pa \co{Actual} responsibility not \co{founded concretely} in the higher\co{community} gets involved into interminable search for the criteriaseparating things for which one should be (held) responsible from those forwhich one should not.  Such criteria are certainly of forensic importance but donot concern us. Lack of \co{foundation} demands often explicit assumptionof responsibility. It is like marking a new area as being \co{mine}, belongingto \co{me}, falling under \co{my} responsibility. Such \co{acts} are oftenrequired in various contexts of cooperation and subordination. But if this istheir only foundation, it witnesses to an \co{ego} which is sufficiently\co{alienated} to believe that there are things -- sufficiently remote,sufficiently \co{not-mine} -- for which one might not be responsible. Reducingresponsibility to such very specific contexts and situations goes hand in handwith other forms of reduction. For responsibility is interwoven into a whole\nexus\ of ontic presuppositions which have to be reduced when one attempts toreduce its scope.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{Resp} conducts a systematic analysis.} Forinstance, a temporal loss of consciousness can be used to exempt one fromresponsibility for the act performed in such a state. This, of course,presupposes a specific reduction of person according to which, for instance,sleeping man is not a person. Well\ldots No! Of course, he is but\ldots Well.Likewise, one will often use past history of a person to excuse his actsimplying, as it were, that they are merely consequences of bad influences of theenvironment. It is then really hard to get out of the impasse because now, so itseems, responsible person is only somebody not exposed to any negativeinfluences, as if the crucial \co{aspect} of moral responsibility did not concernexactly the ways in which one is affected by and reacts to such influences.Reduction of responsibility to only conscious and voluntarily intended acts isjust another form of reducing person to a \co{subject}.\pa Everything we have said about responsibility concerns only \co{my}responsibility, only what \co{I} am responsible for. No consequences follow forimputing responsibility to others.  The problem with such attribution, like withany demands of moral behaviour, is that nobody can be forced to recognise itsvalidity. One can not make somebody responsible for something -- one can at mosttry to force him to take responsibility. This is an issue for the lawenforcement units and not for us. In contacts with people one will, of course,assess the level to which they feel responsible for various things and actaccordingly, perhaps, by suggesting more responsibility than they are preparedto admit. Rising children one will teach them taking responsibility -- directly,by requiring them to \co{actually} take responsibility for various things, andindirectly, just by being responsible the way one is. Our \thi{universal  responsibility}, like everything else, is only for personal use.  It is theway of avoiding \co{alienation}, of avoiding \co{positing objective} evil byimputing responsibility for encountered suffering. \co{Objectivisation} of eviland resulting tense responsibility is the domain of a rigid moralist who isready to censure every single act, of others' and sometimes of oneself, for its moralshortcomings.  Strict and solemn seriousness of such an attitude finds the moreoffenders and becomes the more self-justifying and irritably sensitive, the moredoubts about its ultimate justification germinate at its bottom, that is, theless \co{concretely founded} is its perspective on human \co{existence} whichterminates at its moral dimension, if not at the level of single \co{acts}.\noo{Seriousness which can not stand a slip or a joke is as bad as irony which  can not stand any seriousness.  Each in its way, witnesses to an exaggeration:  one, to the exaggeration of the inflexible formalism which distributes  responsibilities as name-tags on a conference, and the other, to the  exaggeration of the formlessness of the background which, indeed, underlies  all \co{actual experiences} but does not constitute identities of their  contents. } \noo{ which everything eventually, unless kept with the power of  the authority -- whether tradition, custom, communion, mutual understanding,  or genuine dedication...}\noo{ The burden of the insistent responsibility is not at all related to the  difficulties of acting in a prescribed and purposeful manner which happen to  go counter one's inclinations. This burden is the result of a deeper  \co{alienation} which misunderstands responsibility as a matter of  distribution of specific duties, which makes one think that mastering a  situation requires control over events which turn out to be beyond one's  control.  \co{Dissociation} of \co{actualities} without \co{concrete    foundation} makes taking up responsibility for one issue a painful offer and  regret over the impossibility of taking it also for another, equally important  and valuable. As usual, what one ends up doing in practice may, at least from  \thi{outside}, seem indistinguishable, but the ways in which it is done differ  infinitely.    The more such \co{alienation}, the more despair and the more of the  accompanying sense of hopeless responsibility. In the extreme cases, this may  lead to rigidity of a moralist for whom every single act must be consciously  verified for its moral content, which insistence ends in fact in verbal  formalism and lists of laws forbidding and prescribing all the details of  one's conduct.    \say add: Seriousness, solemn dedication to the objective goals, erasure of  oneself in the directedness of the task, is just {like the resolute dedication    to the opposite pole of personal responsibility, and} like seriousness in  general -- it }\noo{ We are also responsible for all the identities and substances: in the  inanimate world, they are relative to our existence. We observed that their  being \thi{in themselves} can be dissolved, just like a child can dissolve  every issue by asking naively penetrating questions. Drawing from this the  consequence that no identities and substances are to be taken into account  would be ... childish or irresponsible. Blaming facts for one's behaviour...}\sep%\vspace*{-3ex}\pa All the above examples might suggest an ideal which seems as fantastic asunrealistic. But ideals which do not and can not live are \co{posited} phantoms,regulative ideas or ideological goals, \co{egotic} projections, in short,\co{idols}.  Well, for the first, \citet{[a]ll things excellent are as difficult  as they are rare.}{SpinozaEthics}{[the last sentence]} More significantly, all\co{invisible aspects} of \co{concrete foundation} appear ridiculous whenreduced to the \co{actual} categories; the appearance which is only strengthenedby possible \co{inversions}.  All-embracing, \co{spiritual} responsibility, whenattempted at the level of \co{actual} feelings and expressions, will result notin any factual responsibility and acts but rather in the hysteric lamentationsof elderly (and good) women over the evils and cruelty of the world.\co{Actual} responsibility for everything, \co{actual} freedom of every singlechoice and action, \co{actual} communion with every man one meets, \co{actual}love towards every person, animal and thing -- all such reductions reflect onlythe reduction of \co{self} to \co{ego} (II:\ref{sub:objsubj}.\refp{pa:SelfEgo}),the fundamental misunderstanding which attempts to interpret the \co{spiritual}in \co{visible} terms, to turn the quality and \co{rest} of \co{acts} intofacts, the wind into stones. But \wo{[t]he wind bloweth where it listeth, and  thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and  whither it goeth.}$^{\ref{ftnt:wind}}$ \co{Concrete foundation},\co{forgetfulness} of the spiritual, dispenses with any such reductions which isjust another side of dispensing with any attempts to re-produce \co{invisible}as some \co{visible} image, to reach the infinite making only finitely manyfinite steps. Leaving all \thi{whats} aside, it keeps \co{thirsting} withoutseeking, it keeps the \co{clear} sight of the fact \co{that} its \co{actuality}is indeed \co{founded} in the higher sphere, and that it carries responsibilityfor the \co{concreteness} of this \co{foundation}, even if it is not entirelyits work.Unlike unreachable ideals which can only be approximated, we are dealing herewith the most \co{concrete presence} -- it need not be approximated because itcan not be made \co{actual} and palpable. Trying to approximate it in one's mere\co{acts} is already a sign of failure, of an image that it is reducible to mere\co{acts} and thus, that it can be captured by them. But one can not defend it, norfight for it, nor try to reach it -- one can at most live it. Someimpossibilities are difficult only because they are too simple. But, asConfucius says, life is simple and only man insists on making it complicated.\co{Any experience} of love which is not fully \co{incarnated love} is distortedand is \co{aware} of its imperfection.  Most \co{experiences} are of this kindbut \co{love} is not, for this reason, an unattainable ideal, a regulative idea,an inaccessible goal. If only one person in the whole human history reached its\co{experience}, this would be enough to maintain its universal possibility.There are all reasons to suspect that there were more than only one and, in caseof doubt, one should look carefully around oneself, {expecting the unexpected.}The imagined absence is often only the inability to \co{recognise} the\co{presence}.  \co{Concrete love} is not a mere state of mind, a mere feeling,an unclear image of something ideal and in its mere desirability completely\thi{unreal} because not \co{actual}. It is a thoroughly \co{concrete  manifestation} flowing from the center of personal being and embracing thewhole life, from \co{above} all general thoughts and \co{qualities}, through all\co{actions} and goals, to the most \co{immediate} \co{acts}.\paBut one might still ask: where is the necessity? Where is the necessity of\co{concrete foundation} of all these lower elements in the higher ones and,eventually, in the  \co{spiritual love}? Wecan easily imagine a man who is strong but not patient, who is strong andpatient but not humble, who finds great sense in life without having confronted\co{nothingness}, who is alert and vigilant but not \co{open}, who acts morally andresponsibly not only without any higher \co{command} but exactly because he does not recognise any higher authority, etc., etc., etc.Indeed, we can as easily imagine such a man as we can imagine Pegasus. Forimagination enables us exactly to put together, almost arbitrarily, variousfeatures earlier \co{dissociated} from each other. The games which\co{reflection} can play with its \co{dissociated signs} are almostunlimited. And they affect the world, just like other \co{distinctions} do. Thequestion is, however, whether such abstractly drawn \co{distinctions} andarranged \co{complexes} correspondto others, whether they can be woven into the \co{unity} of \co{existence} andits \co{experience} of the world -- and that \co{concretely}, not as mereimaginations.Necessity of \co{concrete foundation} does not concern any specific aspect; aswe have emphasized, each particular element can be found at a lower level without\co{concrete foundation} in the higher ones.  The old question, whether virtuescan be possessed separately or only all together, posits wrong alternative -- inpractice, in nature, both cases occur, albeit the former much more frequentlythan the latter.  Focusing on one such feature, the difference between the twocases might, for an \thi{outside} observer, seem slight to the degree ofinsignificance. But the lack of \co{actually} observable differences andbehaviours does not, by itself, witness to anything of significance. In fact,the difference is infinite and, like every infinity, \co{actually}unobservable. So, after all, the alternative is real but it concerns somethingmuch deeper than the mere occurrence of this or that virtue. It concerns the wholeperson. The \co{unfounded} virtues can be \co{dissociated} and appear in very differentconstellations.  One will then often strive for strengthening some of thevirtues one does not possess and such exercises can easily take big part oflife. Such virtues can be, piecewise, acquired. The process may turn out veryvaluable and lead to a deeper development. However, there is also always thechance that aiming particularly at, say, perseverance, one will keep bitingone's teeth and grow only more stubborn or more bitter, as the positedperseverance keeps sneaking out of one's \co{actual} grasp never matching theintended image. Developing (right) habits is a lengthy and complicated processwhich even in the case of children escapes clear-cut rules and all too preciseguidelines. It is particularly difficult, if not outright impossible, when oneaims at only one specific aspect. The \co{unity} of a person has also thistrivial consequence that, for instance, quitting smoking may result in increasedconsumption of candies, while developing perseverance may result in a loss of,say, the sense of spontaneity. Every change of no matter how small aspectaffects the whole person or, as one also puts it, must be integrated into thiswhole. Such psycho-\co{egotic} manipulations have always side-effects which areas understandable, having once emerged, as they were unpredictable in advance.According to St.~Thomas, the theological virtues of faith, hope and charity areinfused directly by God, and only by Him.\noo{SumTh.II:I.q62.a} But also moraland intellectual virtues which, under natural circumstances, can be acquiredseparately by human efforts, can be infused by God, so that they are\citet{caused in us by God without any action on our part, but not without our  consent.}{SumTh}{II:I.q55.a4.r6} The acquired virtues of this kind function,so to speak, each for itself and without reaching the personal center. Theirinfused versions, on the other hand, are \co{concretely founded} in the\co{unity}: first, the lower \co{unity} of the \co{invisible} sphere where, aswe saw in II:\ref{sub:invArch}, various \co{aspects} cannot be meaningfully\co{dissociated} from each other and, eventually, in the \co{unity} of the\co{existential} center, where \co{grace} becomes \citet{charity, which through  an image in the mind exhibits what is absent as present to ourselves, through  love unites what is divided, settles what is confused, associates things that  are unequal, completes things that are imperfect! Rightly does the excellent  preacher call it the bond of perfectness; since, though the other virtues  indeed produce perfectness, yet still charity binds them together so that they  can no longer be loosened from the heart of one who loves.}{GregoryEpist}{Book  V:LIII. To Virgilius, Bishop.}  Thus, even if for an \thi{outside} observer,two kinds of virtues can seem indistinguishable (since patience {\em is}patience, temperance {\em is} temperance), the ones are as if added to theperson while the others flow from the person.  The \co{concretely founded} onesare only \co{manifestations} of the \co{spiritual unity} of the person, the\co{visible signs} of \Yes. Only this \co{transcendent foundation} gives themall their force and adds the \co{invisible rest} -- continuity and \co{unity} --making all the difference.\noo{Now besides the theological virtues, according to the doctrine of St. Thomas,there are also moral and intellectual virtues of their very nature Divinelyinfused, as prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. These infused virtuesdiffer from the acquired virtues*       as to their effective principle, beingimmediately caused by God, whilst the acquired virtues are caused by acts of acreated vital power;*       by reason of their radical principle, for theinfused virtues flow from sanctifying grace as their source, whereas theacquired virtues are not essentially connected with grace;*       by reason of theacts they elicit, those of the infused virtues being intrinsically supernatural,those of the acquired not exceeding the capacity of human nature;*       whilstone mortal sin destroys the infused virtues, with the acquired virtues acts ofmoral sin are not necessarily incompatible, as contrary acts are not directlyopposed to the corresponding contrary habit.}\noo{ \citeti{O how good is charity, which through love exhibits absent things    in an image to one's self as though they were present, unites things    divided, sets in order things confused, associates things unequal,    consummates things imperfect!  How rightly the excellent preacher calls it    the bond of perfectness, since the other virtues indeed produce perfectness,    but yet charity so binds them that they cannot now be unloosed from the mind    of hint that loves.}{St.~Gregory the Great}{vol.

Butwhile in Book I we were concerned with the merely ontological meaning of the\co{one}, now we want to emphasize that also with respect to the \co{spiritual  presence} and \co{concrete foundation}, equipping Godhead with all kinds ofattributes, whether in essence, in fact or only in name, is inappropriatewhenever it may obscure the fact of his complete \co{invisibility}.One has often emphasized the \thi{human need to speak about God}. There may besuch a need, and it may be very human, but this is exactly the question and notthe answer.  The need reflects the fundamental meaning of the divine in ourlife, the meaning which awaits if not an explanation nor even an account, so atleast an expression. But \citeti{[b]e not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine  heart be hasty to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou  upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.}{Eccl.}{V:2} Speaking about Godmay be harmful when it \co{posits} too many attributes and dwells on Hisinaccessible \thi{essence}.  \citet{We cannot approve of what those foolish  persons do who are extravagant in praise, fluent and prolix in the prayers  they compose, and in the hymns they make in the desire to approach the  Creator.}{Perplex}{I:59} For where is the border between praise and appraisal,and then between praise and self-complacency over praising the right God in theright way? There may be a border and it may be marked by the extravagantexaggeration. Yet from the start, speaking about \co{nothing} we usedistinctions and distinct words which, in the last resort, means that we canonly speak about ourselves, about our \co{confrontation}. \citet{Everything  which falls under a name is originated, whether [we] will or not.}{Stromata}{  V:13} And so, only \citeti{silence is praise to Thee.}{Ps.}{LXV:2. Maimonides'  interpretation is the same as St.~Jerome's, cf.  II:footnote~\ref{ftnt:silencePraise}.  In \abr{kjv}, however, the  whole verse reads: \wo{O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh    come}.}Having made these reservations, let us nevertheless pay some tribute to the humanneed to speak about God. This need reflects the fact that God is notmerely an inaccessible and plain nothingness but is \co{concretely} and\co{absolutely present}, which \co{presence} has fundamental \co{existential}significance. \subsection{Proper names}\pa No name is adequate for God, just like no name is adequate for aperson.\ftnt{Cf.~footnote~\ref{ftnt:latinNames} concerning the  homonymy of \wo{name} standing for both nouns and adjectives.} This is whylanguage has proper names, for proper name is the only adequate name for aperson; no other name, not to mention any predicate or more or less definitedescription, will even approach this adequacy. So is it with God -- \wo{God} isHis only adequate name. Perhaps, it should be {\sc jhvh}, for \wo{God} may beused about lesser gods and idols, too.\noo{But it is not important what name is  being used or misused, but what is meant.} The fact that, saying \wo{God}, onecan mean various things does not make the name -- when applied properly -- lessadequate, just like knowing two persons with the same name \wo{Thomas} does notmake any of its applications wrong or inadequate.  They are both persons andeach has {\em a unique} name (instead of two persons with the same {\em name}\wo{Thomas}, one could rather speak of persons with the same {\em names}\wo{Thomas}.) It is only a trivial accident of secondary importance that theirunique names have the same linguistic appearance. (The use of patronymics, offamily names, middle names, etc. can be seen as an attempt to keep thelinguistic appearances in accordance with the uniqueness of the named persons.)The uniqueness of a proper name follows from the fact that the word used as aname is inseparable from the \co{acts} of naming. There is hardly anysyntactically identifiable class of words which are \thi{names}.  Sure,\wo{Thomas} and \wo{Berit} and hundreds of other words are standard names.  Butthey do so exclusively for the reason of being so used, that is, of being usedfor {\em naming}. Name is inseparable from the fact and \co{act} of naming, itis the sedimented epitome of the latter, while naming itself is atrans-linguistic, in fact, trans-phenomenal event of recognising uniqueness ofthis \co{concrete existence}. Unrepeatability, ultimately the uniqueness of\co{existence}, is the \co{conceptual} content of every proper name.  The actualname, as well as the \co{act} of naming, is only an expression of the deep eventof naming in which one recognises the unrepeatable character of a being,usually, of some \co{existence}. Getting a child, the parents have already namedit, already long in advance, even if they still do not know what actual name itwill get. The linguistic expression of this event, the \co{actual} naming,endows it with the immediately recognisable aspect of \co{non-actuality},solidifies it into a lasting, usually even social, fact. One could say, propername \co{reflects} the \co{eternal aspect} of the named \co{existence} in the perpetualconsistency of all different \co{acts} of naming.\paCorresponding to the absolute uniqueness, a name does not capture anyessence, it is, as often observed, conceptually empty.%% (It would be ridiculous to say that \wo{Thomas} has any extension -- all persons% named \wo{Thomas}, or perhaps, that its intention is the set of all persons with% the name \wo{Thomas} in all possible worlds. Rather, all living beings, for I% could have a dog called \wo{Thomas}.)%This conceptual emptiness makes proper names the most \co{concrete} among thelinguistic \co{signs} -- they are understood {\em uniquely}, or not at all. Andthis unique understanding involves only \co{that}, identification of the personnamed, identification which happens within the \hoa, but which only reflects the\co{unity} beyond any concepts.  This trans-conceptuality of names expresses thehighest respect and recognition of the named -- in general, we name humans. In asimilar way, we express some amount of recognition and respect naming otherliving beings, pets, etc.. But if one started naming one's pencils or pieces offurniture, we would react to the misunderstood endowment of such disposablethings with the metaphysical quality of trans-conceptual being.\noo{(But as  usual -- where is the border\ldots?)}  Names like \wo{Sitting Bull} or\wo{Crazy Horse}, or usual {nicknames}, do intend to express some essentialaspects, one might perhaps say, some \co{concept}. But they are proper namesonly in virtue of the {\em uniqueness} of their reference.  Proper name does notcapture any essence but only indicates the site of its possibility, the uniqueindividuality.  It indicates the ultimate limit of \co{distinctions}, beyondwhich not only no more \co{distinctions} are made but were no \co{distinctions}could possibly be made.%It indicates a \thi{substance} which in our account is only \co{existence}.\subsection{Names}\label{names}The decisive issue is, just as with \wo{Sitting Bull} and the like, {\em what}one intends when using a name. One can endow \wo{Sitting Bull} with the derogatorycontent by simply reducing it to the mere description, that is, ignoring thefact that it is a proper name. Likewise, forgetting that \wo{God} is a propername, one tends to reduce its meaning. The traditional discussion is concernedwith the admissible, if any, ways of such a reduction; not with the proper namesbut with the names understood as possible predicates of God.% The following few paragraphs are essentially only a repetition of Section% \ref{sub:OneMany}. \pa \citeti{All creatures have existed eternally in the divine essence, as in  their exemplar.

On the other hand, it was the image of thehighest somewhat \thi{containing} everything lower, as a box contains sand or asgenus contains species, that forced one to double things with exemplary ideasand, eventually, to make Godhead responsible for all the details of the\co{visible world}.  But \co{virtuality} does not \thi{contain} all the\co{distinctions} which flow from it, except as their \co{indistinct}\co{origin}.  {Substantiality} of self-identical, independent entities has beendiscussed earlier in, hopefully, sufficient detail.  Application of thiscategory to the \co{invisibles} leads unavoidably to antinomies.

All the  disputed and undisputed names and attributes are but the attributes arising  from the attitude -- the \co{spiritual} attitude -- of the one who pronounces  them.

The two -- let us say, theultimate \thi{Good} and \thi{Evil} -- do not represent opposite ontologicalpoles; ontologically, they are the same \co{nothingness}. \thi{Evil} is not only the last, lowest level of emanations from the \thi{Good}, or perhaps even only alack of some aspect of a full emanation. In a much more Christian way,\thi{Evil} has its site at the very beginning, it emerges from paradise with thefirst human: %or, as we would say, in the very depth of \co{invisible}:it is very {close to} Godhead.\ftnt{Of course, one can find neo-Platonic  fragments pointing in this direction, like for instance: \citef{The evil that    has overtaken them [the souls] has its source in self-will, in the entry    into the sphere of process, and in the primal differentiation with the    desire for self ownership.}{Plotinus}{V:1.1}} But this closeness to the\co{origin} does not mean that \thi{Evil} follows from it. It only means thathuman \co{existence} reaches all the way to the border of \co{nothingness} --only therefore \thi{Evil} can corrupt it so deeply, even if never completely,when, instead of \co{opening} up this ultimate border, it makes it impassable.The two represent only the characteristics of the {\em meeting} with God, theextreme and opposite possibilities of the \co{existential confrontation}: the\No\ which sees only emptiness and void, and the \Yes\ which, too, sees\co{nothing}, but \co{nothing} which is the \co{invisible  origin}.\ftnt{Considering the Biblical personalism, Paul Tillich remarks  \citef{There is no sense to ask if the holiness itself is personal or if its    carriers are persons.

Assumingthat such an alternative is at all possible, one has already falsified themeaning of the possible positive answer. %A better question would be \wo{What does \wo{God} mean?}, or even \wo{What does  God mean?}, though this, obviously, involves one in the matters on which eventhe most prominent theologians (or, perhaps, especially they) can not agree.Any \co{precise} answer can be accused of arbitrariness (but this should notworry us for we view any specifics of this matter at most as \co{analogues}).The advantage of this form of the question is that the previous alternative(\wo{He is not} vs. \wo{He is}) becomes now \wo{He means nothing} vs. \wo{He  means something}. The former will quickly declare Him to be non-existent butit will also tend to involve some uneasy awareness of rejecting more than oneintended.%No matter the declared choice, one feels that the question has now much moredirect relevance, that it addresses not only the universal order of the\co{objective} world but also one's \co{existence}. And it does it because italso makes more clear the underlying element of choice which is not dictatedmerely by \co{objective} \thi{being} or \thi{non-being} of something, but by theway one meets whatever one meets.At the very beginning, I:\refp{pa:imago}, we likened \co{existence} to an\la{imago} of \co{nothingness}, not in the sense of a similitude but of areflection, like one player reflects the moves of the other. The asymmetry of\co{confrontation} can be likened to the fact that one player has a winningstrategy, in fact, is bound to win. But as the game admits the win-winsituations, the other player can win, too. \Yes\ amounts to finding the winningstrategy and becoming not only an \la{imago} but also \la{similitudo Dei}.  The\thi{names} of God are attempts to indicate the winning strategy.  Men call God\wo{good} and not \wo{evil}, \wo{omnipotent} and not \wo{impotent}, and\citet{in saying that God lives, they assuredly mean more than to say the He is  the cause of our life, or that He differs from inanimate bodies.}{SumTh}{  I:q13.a2} The \thi{names} attributed to God are expressions of \Yes, and assuch are not arbitrary predicates ascribed to \co{nothingness} which cannot beascribed any. They tell one how one could and should \co{experience} -- not Godbut -- the \co{confrontation} with the divine.  For \citeti{the form of God is  itself the joy with which it is recognised.}{Visvanatha}{\citaft{Huxley}{    VII}\kilde{p.138}}%(Though this may point too much towards conscious recognition...)The \wo{should} does not express any moral obligation but an admonition. If onedoes not \co{experience confrontation} in the \thi{prescribed} way, one is notnecessarily condemned but only reminded about its possible a desirable form,about what is possibly wrong, even if any \thi{how and why it happened} remainsunclear. Good advice is not that which one can understand but that which can, ifproperly followed, help one. \pa Just like \co{commands} leave us free to accept or ignore them, so God'sface reflects only the \sch\ made in the soul's depth. \Sch\ \co{founds concretely} the \co{quality} of the world and its \co{experience}which become permeated by the aspects reflecting the underlying \yes\ or \No.\Yes\ establishes a relation between the contents of all the levels,\co{founding} thus also \co{concrete} ways of encounter and \co{experience}. The\co{traces} -- down to the level of the most \co{actual} \co{reflections} -- ofthe \sch, the \co{signs} of the \co{absolute}, are what we call the\wo{\co{analogues}}.The term \wo{\co{analogy}} is used in the way St.~Thomas would only partlyaccept.%In \ref{sub:projections} we have argued for the thorough reality of the%\sch\ which was furthest removed from any projections.\co{Love}, \co{humility}, etc. are not only genuine \co{aspects} of \co{spirit}-- they are also adequately, absolutely and non-analogically predicated aboutit.  This is possible because \co{spiritual} relation to \co{nothingness} is notsomething absolutely foreign to human \co{experience} but, on the contrary, themost intimately \co{present}, whether \co{concretely} or not, \co{aspect} ofthis \co{experience}. The impossibility to specify \co{precisely} their meaningdoes not, in any way, diminish \co{concreteness} of this meaning. On the otherhand, they not only belong merely \co{analogically} to the aspects of\co{visible} experience, but are also predicated \co{analogically} about it.For this experience, even if prior with respect to the \co{reflective}knowledge, is actually \co{founded} in the \co{invisibles}. It is from therethat words like \wo{love}, \wo{humility}, \wo{goodness}, etc.  obtain theirgenuine meaning, which is only \co{analogically} applied to the \co{visible}\co{analogues} of the \co{spiritual love}. The fact that we cannot define\co{precisely} what they mean, does not mean that we do not know that. Even if\co{spiritual love} has not been our share, so \co{thirst} is the ever\co{present} reminder of what it could mean.\noo{(Besides, as observed earlier,  meaning of almost any term can not be defined \co{precisely} and finally,  depending always on the level to which \co{distinctions} are drawn.)} Aquinaswould say: \citet{as regards what these names signify, they are applied  primarily to God but as regards the imposition of the names, they are  primarily applied to creatures which we know first -- hence they have a mode  of signification which belongs to creatures.}{SumTh}{[after I:q13.a6.ans.]} Thislooks almost the same, but in our case not even the mode of significationbelongs to creatures -- with respect to particulars we never know exactly what\wo{love} or \wo{humility} mean, we are seldom entirely certain if the use ofsuch names is perfectly adequate, if the \co{actual sign}, the \co{act}, is truewith respect to the \co{invisible} truth which it should respect.  Thisuncertainty, however, does not prove that we do not know what they mean, but atmost that we do not know it \co{precisely}. We are uneasy with applying them toall too particular situations because, as a matter of fact, they do not quiteapply there. To some extent -- but only to {\em some} extent -- we can recogniseparticular \co{acts} of love or humility, but they emerge as such only becausewe recognise their \co{foundation} in \co{love} or \co{humility}: there is no\thi{act of love} without love, and we do not learn what \wo{love} means bycollecting examples of any particular (kinds of) acts, by taking a course.% some solipsism seems to be sneaking in here...???!?!??!?!!!!Most probably, we learn it {\em before} we learn anything else. In any case, itis not so that we know \wo{creatures first}, unless we let \wo{knowledge} meannothing more then the \co{reflective} \gre{episteme}, \refp{pa:beKnow}.  The\co{analogues}, these \co{traces} of the deepest and most \co{concrete aspects}of \co{experience}, are not any \co{actual signs}, are not any misnomersmisunderstood as properties of some \co{actual objects}. (Although, of course,there is also such possibility.)  They reside primarily in the \co{rest} of any\co{actuality} and are also known -- consciously, though only \co{gnostically}-- to reside there.\noo{ As \co{reflection} always tends to posit an  \co{object}, any \co{experienced non-actuality} tends for it to assume the  form of a subsisting entity.  Within the \hoa, the \nexus\ (of \yes\ or \No)  gets \co{dissociated} into two main aspects of the \co{external objectivity}  and the internal, arbitrary \co{subjectivity}. The qualities of the  \co{experience}, the \co{traces} of the \co{choice} acquire then, on the one  hand, the character of the \co{objective} properties of some mysterious object  or agent and, on the other hand but simultaneously and equiprimordially with  the former, of a merely \co{subjective} experience, eventually, perhaps,  ungrounded caprice. In the former case, the \co{analogues} acquire the  character of \co{objectivistic} features, in the latter of \co{subjectivistic}  projections.  Although the whole schema is wrong, it may also be legitimate to  the extent that \co{reflection} stays aware of that and does not identify the  \thi{objectified} \co{analogue} with its original source or, perhaps, does not  ascribe its {objectivity} to any \co{object}.%The uncritical \co{analogues} arise from \co{positing} an \co{object} to whichthey are attached, which easily leads to all kinds of antinomies.  In a genuinesense, the \co{analogues} are but expressions of the most \co{concrete},underlying \co{experience}. %-- expressions of the radiating, all-embracing\co{love} which is not \co{mine} but, on the contrary, which dawns on \co{me}from \co{above} as a \co{transcendent gift}, a \co{gift} in which \co{I} only\co{participate} and which affects the whole Being.%Various aspects of the \co{experience} following from \yes, respectively \No,may be expressed in the \thi{objective}, or better, \thi{objectified} terms asproperties of something.  What this something is, does not matter much and,indeed, must remain for \co{actual reflection} completely \co{vague} andindeterminate.  Yet, the \yes, the \yes\ to the \co{invisible} Godhead, is alsoa \yes\ to the world, while \No\ is the \No\ to Godhead which is grounded inthe wish to say yes to the world.}%\co{Reflection} may, and in fact it does, take recourse to the \thi{analogical  way of speaking}, in which the \co{aspects} of the \co{spiritual} dimension ofBeing find \co{reflections} as sedimented and \co{dissociated} properties, asthe \co{analogues} predicated about some being, about something. What thissomething is remains forever hidden in the \co{nothingness} of its conception,and the best name man has got is \wo{God}.  But in fact these properties andpredicates are but expressions of the \co{experience} starting in the\co{spiritual} center of Being, of the \co{aspects} which defy anyobjectification and remain forever in the background, in the \co{rest}.  Fromthis \co{invisible} depth they affect all the \co{actual experiences} in themost significant way.  If God is good, omnipotent, forgiving, loving, etc., onemay imagine that all the problems are solved or, as the case may be, posed. Butsuch \co{analogues} neither create nor answer any problems. They only expresssome \co{aspects} of the \co{spiritual} dimension of \co{existence} which,living \Yes, confronts all the same problems and particulars as any other\co{existence} -- what is different is only the form, the \co{quality} of this\co{confrontation}.\subsub{Yes}The \co{analogues} of each \co{choice} are only expressions of various\co{aspects} of the respective \nexus. Without attempting any completeness, wetherefore list only a few standard examples.\noo{ thankfulness -- was also \thi{wonder}, \thi{philosophical wonder}...  humility -- fear of God \simu admiration\& respect \simu obedience forbidden  \simu invisible: do not try to actualise }\ad{Omnipotence}\label{adhumility} The \co{humility} of \co{love} means\co{recognition} that \co{I am not the master}, \co{recognition} of the\co{origin} as the ultimate power which is the power of the source.  Even ifnothing \co{actually} is the way it was at the beginning, when it emerged \la{in  illo tempore} from the \co{virtuality} of the \co{origin}, so without thissource, nothing would be there.\noo{Without the \co{indistinct} ground, no  \co{distinction} would be possible.} This simple indispensability -- not theability to determine every minute detail of \co{this world} -- is theomnipotence of God.  Without Him there would be nothing, which is verydifferent from saying that everything is the way He has made it.\citeti{Without Me, ye can do nothing.}{John}{XV:5} -- is very different from\wo{You do everything the way I want}.  The indispensability of having Him as the first condition accounts also for themisused label of \wo{necessary being}.  Once we have reduced necessity tological necessity, even to an appropriately interpreted unary sententialoperator $\Box$, there isn't much left\ldots But we have objected to the linguisticreductions. %%%%%% ????? indispensable - is it better? God is certainly not necessary in the sense of being a particular agent whoseabsence would entail a logical self-contradiction.\ftnt{One could, however,  attempt the \thi{proof} of the form: if there were nothing to \co{distinguish}  (nothing \co{indistinct}), there could be nothing \co{distinguished}.} He isnecessary in the above sense of being omnipotent, in the sense that without Him,there would be (not only \co{nothing} but) absolutely nothing, total emptiness.\citet{If \co{one} is not, then nothing is.}{Parmenides}{} \co{Reflection} canbe more comfortable with viewing Him as the necessary condition, not thenecessary cause, of everything that is.  The cosmological argument claimswell-foundedness of the order of causality, but we would recast it in terms ofthe order of \co{founding}. It can be then viewed as an expression of theintuition that this ordering is well-founded and has the \co{origin}, theindispensable condition of all the rest.\ftnt{This was expressed, for instance,  as the distinction between \thi{productive} and \thi{conserving} causes (Cf.  I:\ref{sub:virt}.\refp{pa:foundingCausing}.)  Ockham pointed out that the  order of \thi{productive} causes with Duns Scotus\noo{(cf. footnote    \ref{ft:JDS}, p.\pageref{ft:JDS})} could actually be continued \la{ad    infinitum} (in time), and to avoid this possibility he \thi{modified} the  argument (for God's existence) by introducing \thi{conserving causes}. The  modification can be disputed for Scotus, too, observed in his proof  simultaneity of the \thi{essential causes}.  Such a cause need not  \thi{produce} a thing but it maintains it in its being, and as such is  co-present with the thing itself.  ({\em Actual} infinity of causes seemed  absurd to all, and so the conclusion about the first cause followed.)  This  form of causation, then, seems to correspond to our \co{founding}  co-presence of all levels of hypostases, which nevertheless coincides  with the generative order of \thi{productive} causes.\noo{But we do not aim at    an interpretation of the Scholastics and won't bother you with the details.}  (Ockham's \thi{proof} can be found in \citeauthor*{OckPhysicorum}{ q.82-86}.)  \noo{p.122}} The \co{indistinct nothingness} is, indeed, the first cause, butnot in any sense of \co{actual} causality -- it is the first cause being thefirst and necessary condition of everything. The necessity of the \co{one} ishere, almost analytically, the same as the indispensability of the\co{foundation} in its \co{original indistinctness}.  If we take the label\wo{cause} in this deeper sense of \co{foundation} then \co{one}, remaining\co{indistinct above} and {\em before} all \co{distinctions}, is not only thecause of everything but is also \thi{self-caused}: \co{indistinct} needs no\co{distinctions}, I:\ref{pa:IndistinctNeedsNo}, \refp{pa:IndistinctNeedsNo}.That God is the only uncaused, that is, self-caused being, used to be butanother way of formulating His necessity, though here we are approaching all toomuch the level of \co{concepts} and \co{visible} determinations.  Eventually,His necessity is the same as His omnipotence -- not the ability to do everythingbut to \co{create}, to bring something, primarily \co{existence}, out of\co{nothing}, without which event nothing else would appear. %and to be the only one who can do that...\pa In a much less genuine sense (meaning, leading to, or even perhapsdisplaying, a misunderstood {objectification}), one speaks \co{analogically}about \thi{His will}.%and \co{my} obedience or disobedience to it.But the \wo{Godhead is poor, naked and empty as though it were not; it has not,  wills not, wants not, works not, gets not.}$^{\ref{cit:getsNot}}$ Only\co{existence} can will.  \thi{God's will} is but an expressions conveying what\co{I} should will -- \co{nothing} or, to give it more positive appearance, tosay \yes. There is no more content in \thi{God's will} than the salvationthrough \co{love}.  \citet{Sin is nothing else than that the creature willeth  otherwise than God willeth, and contrary to Him.}{TheolGerm}{XXXVI} Indeed,but this \thi{will of God} which, in a deep confusion one can attempt to lookfor in \co{visible signs}, is nothing else than that \co{I} do not sin, that\co{I} do not make \co{idols} of \co{this world} but, instead, find the\co{absolute love}.  For \citetib{as long as a man is seeking his own good, he  does not seek what is best for him, and will never find it.}{TheolGerm}{XXXIV}\citet{We strive always for the forbidden, and we desire things  denied.}{OvidAmor}{III:4.17} \co{My} obedience -- if one insists, obedience toGod's will -- is thus nothing more (nor less) than directedness towards \Yes. Itis \co{humility} which does not try to reach for the \co{invisible} -- forbidden-- fruits. It may be rightly called the \wo{fear of God} and, although thereneed not be any \co{actual} fear in such an attitude, it is again an expressionof God's omnipotence.  \noo{Trying to \co{actualise} the \co{invisibles} is, as  far as we have presented it, attempting an impossibility. Trying to quench  \co{thirst} one only creates \co{idols}.  In refraining from that one may see  respect for what is higher as much as a fear of it. In either case, the  omnipotent being dwells beyond the limits of \co{visibility}, in a place (if  place it were) inaccessible. }\noo{\subpa Similarly, one speaks about \thi{God's works}.  But He\wo{works not}. Even \citet{[g]race does not perform any works; it istoo subtle for that and is as far from performing any works as heavenis from earth.}{EckGermSerm}{DW 38, W 29;p.118.} The \co{invisible incarnation} precedes all\co{distinctions} of \co{actual} kind which would allow any works. And all such works happen only through the being which makes therespective \co{distinctions}.  \co{I} do the works, {you} do the works, \co{he} does the works. Like \thi{God's will} so also \thi{Hisworks} are expressions, not very fortunate ones, of the\co{experienced} \co{transcendence} which \co{inspires} \co{me} to dowhat \co{I} do, and which hardly ever determines the particular contents ofthese works.}\ad{Omnipresence}\label{adopenness} The description of omnipotence mighthave left some taste of deism in which Godhead, giving only the initial impulseto the creative differentiation, withdraws from the world leaving it to thesecondary causes, if not entirely to itself. In a sense, this is what we aresaying, for God is never any \co{actual} efficient cause of anything, He neverinterferes directly into the course of \co{actual} events: He remains\co{transcendent}, stays \co{above} all \co{visible} and \co{invisible} things.But at the same time, He is always \co{present}, as the deepest \co{aspect} ofevery situation, as the eventual limit where \co{actuality} dissolves in the\co{invisible} horizon of its \co{foundation}. And as this horizon surroundsevery situation, it not only provides all its \co{actual} and \co{visible}elements but can also bring the completely new and unexpected ones.  For themost, it is like the presence of a quiet person who apparently does notcontribute to the situation, does not influence the events but, by the verypresence, makes the situation into something completely different than what itwould be without this person. And as it later turns out, this was the person whoinvited all the others, opened his house and paid all the drinks. We have justrecalled the distinction between the creative, efficient causes%effect about and the conserving ones that do not produce but sustain and perpetuate theeffects.\noo{I:\ref{pa:foundingCausing}} Again, replacing the former withthe latter, \wo{cause} with \co{foundation}, we recognise such a constantsustaining \co{presence} of the \co{origin} as the \co{invisible} \hoa\ and,eventually, of all \co{visibility} and differentiation.\pa \co{Openness} is openness of the heart for all gifts of the\co{origin}. In more \co{actual} terms, it can denote preparedness to meetwith the open heart everything and everybody but, for the moment, we are relatingit only to the understanding of the (role of the) \co{one}. \co{Openness} means that we\co{recognise} it as omnipresent, that everything is encountered with thefundamental, only implicit rather than explicit understanding of its being a\co{gift} of the \co{origin}, of its being a hierophany and, hence, of the \co{origin} being\co{present} behind it. In the most \co{actualised} form, \co{openness}, this recognition ofomnipresence, can find expression as the constant wonder and joy, as a calmintoxication with the world which at every moment unveils new and fresh eventswhich, by their very freshness and newness, acquire an aspect of miracles. It is not the intensity of such a joy which makes it the\co{analogue}, but its constancy -- as Eckhart puts it \citeti{Who is joyful all the time, he is joyful above the  time, liberated from time.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{Mistyka}{ A:V.8.a\kilde{p.83}}}% \citt{Kto raduje sie caly czas, ten raduje sie ponad czasem, wyzwolony z%   czasu.}{Eckhart, after Otto, Mistyka Wschodu i Zachodu, p.83}The same \co{analogue} may be discerned in the \thi{wonder} owing to which,according to Aristotle, \citet{men both now begin and at first began to  philosophize.}{AristMeta}{II\label{cit:wonder}} Psychological and emotionaldifferences notwithstanding, this famous \thi{philosophical wonder} expressesthe same \co{openness} to the world which is \co{experienced} as a \co{gift}, ifnot miraculous, so in any case generous and wonderful, even in its most wickedappearances. Just like man who is \co{thankfully open} thinks himselfundeservedly rewarded, so \woo{a man who is puzzled and wonders thinks himself  ignorant}{AristMeta,2}$^{\ref{cit:wonder}}$. Being ignorant of everything andwondering at everything, being like a child, is to recognise the generous\co{presence} in every \co{actuality}, to \co{experience} omnipresence.\pa\label{selfomniscient} \co{Self-awareness}, I:\ref{sub:selfAware}, is anaspect of every \co{actual} encounter, which makes \co{me} always, even if onlyimplicitly, aware not only of the thing, the \co{object}, the situation \co{I}am confronting, but also of the fact of this confrontation, of its anchoring inthe field of \co{experience} \co{transcending} the limits of \co{actuality}.Although formally we can say that it is \co{my} \co{self-awareness}, yet it doesnot \thi{belong} to \co{me}, it is not something \co{I} determine and control --it accompanies \co{me} as \co{my} associate, as a witness, not as \co{my}attribute; it is an \co{aspect} of every \co{experience}, never its \co{object}.In \co{my} focusing on the \co{actual} contents of \co{experience}, it witnessesto the \co{presence} of something that \co{transcends} it. Feeble and dependenton \co{my} recognition, on \co{my} acceptance of its voice, in the context of\co{love} it \co{founds} the \co{analogue} we might call \wo{God's  omniscience}.%This is the omniscience of which also those not recognising it are warned:\citeti{Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith  the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth?}{Jer.}{XXIII:24} \citeti{There is no  darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide  themselves.}{Job}{XXXIV:22} It may take the form of a voice of consciencewhich discloses the \co{spiritual} context of \co{my action}, it may be a mere\co{awareness} of the \co{presence} which \co{transcends} \co{actuality} andalso, in the most figurative sense, modified by the \co{reflective} attentiondirected towards it, it may appear as the feeling of \thi{somebody looking at  me}. The lower such a form, the more common it is. But the \co{presence} ofits higher forms, and particularly of conscience, is indeed dependent on the\co{concrete foundation} in \yes. The better a person, the more conscience hehas and, in fact, the more guilt he can feel -- criminals seldom {\em feel}unclean conscience. For conscience is yet another \co{aspect} of \co{openness},which both \co{opens} us for others and \co{opens} the \co{communion} withothers to us.\ad{Goodness}\label{adthankfulness} \co{Thankfulness} amounts to\co{recognition} of the \co{origin} as good or, what amounts to the same,as the source of goodness.  \co{Thankfulness} is but a \co{reflection} ofthe acceptance of the \co{origin}, of the \co{recognition} of its goodness.This goodness, if taken in itself, is empty and impossible to characterise.It does not mean {\em anything else} except the attitude of \co{thankfulness}and acceptance, nothing except the fact that \co{I} \co{recognise} thevalue of everything which \co{I} encounter and am willing to accept it with theunderlying \co{love}.  It is not the attitude of \yes\ which is good, it isnot some God who is good. Goodness is the \co{experience} of\co{thankfulness} rendered in terms of \co{actuality}, is an \co{analogue} ofthe latter.  Nobody who does not know this \co{thankfulness} can everexperience, let alone understand, the goodness of God.% \ftnt{If you%   feel like that, you are welcome to draw from that the consequences for the%   apparent and celebrated \thi{problem} of how possibly a good and omnipotent%   God might have created all the evil in this world. We will return to this%   issue.}Again, in a less genuine sense, one speaks about \thi{God's love}, \thi{God's  benevolence}, etc.  Misleading as such expressions may be, they stand for thepurity of \co{thankfulness} which is its own reward.  It \citet{is not chosen in  order to serve any end, or to get anything by it, but for the love of its  nobleness, and because God loveth and esteemeth it so  greatly.}{TheolGerm}{XXXVIII}\noo{justice is rectitude of will preserved for  its own sake{Anselm, On Truth,p.169}} There is no being, no non-being, no\cross{being} -- if one insists, no God -- sitting there and loving or esteeminganything.  This love and esteem are first of all the value and {nobleness} sucha \co{love} and \co{thankfulness} have in themselves, \co{opening} one to the\co{transcendent gift} which gives the ultimate value to one's life. Certainly,the ineradicable possibility of the \co{gift} of \co{grace}, the fact that itmay be given irrespectively of the earlier circumstances (and sins),irrespectively of how deep one has plunged into the hell and despair, so thateven \citeti{they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath  the light shined}{Isa.}{IX:2} -- this can be taken as an expression of {God's  love} and forgiveness in a quite anthropopathic, almost mundane sense.  Thisshould be a legitimate way of speaking -- if only one remembers that it is\co{analogical}.  \noo{For the ineradicability of the possibility of receiving  \co{grace}, true as it may be, requires already a choice on \co{my} part, an  \co{actual} choice which tries to say \Yes.}\pa A yet more specific \co{analogue} of \co{thankfulness} is the goodness ofthe world, with perhaps the most powerful expression in the idea of the bestpossible world.\ftnt{Although we would tend to see its \co{existential} origin  in the mere fact {\em that} one encounters suffering and is able {\em not} to  turn it into evil, so in the context of theodicy one has to look also for  explanation and justification of this fact.  E.g., \citef{Now, the order of    the universe requires, as was said above (q22.a2.ad2; q48.a2), that there    should be some things that can, and do sometimes, fail.

One might betempted to discern the idea {\em whenever} these two elements are present.Thus one might impute it to Spinoza as much as one observes it in Leibniz. Inthis form the theme can be found also in the pantheism of Stoics according towhich the world must be perfect since it is only the formed and visible aspectof the immanent and active principle, god-\gre{logos}-\gre{pneuma}, which isperfect by definition.\kilde{Powrot,p.73ff.} Neither of these points appealsto our anthropology but we can recognise its underlyingvalue, the \co{motivating} force of acceptance. It is, however, a bit likesaying, in a resigned and moralising tone, \wo{Do not argue, things won't get  better any way}.  It hardly comes close to genuine \co{openness} whichrecognises, equally in the moments of happiness and of suffering, not only  something one has to put up with but goodness deserving \co{thankfulness}.}%  It is impossible to agree concerning what is the exact acceptable \thi{amount of  evil in the world} and whether it is greater or smaller than the total\thi{amount of goodness}. Likewise it is impossible to specify exactly the lawswhich make it impossible to improve this world. But the impossibility lies notin our inability to see or think, but only in the fact that, except for the\co{visible} details which do not affect that much, there is nothing to improvefor nothing else is under our full control. One may become very indignant atsuch a dictum, just like one may deny any necessary laws which cannot betransgressed in the constructions of new brave worlds and then inelimination of some evils. But the more indignant one becomes, the stronger theindication of one's inability to cope with~\ldots the world, that is, withoneself. For indignation, and its associate moralism, arise exactly when one isno longer able to see only various, lesser or bigger evils, but begins torecognise The Evil, the unjust, unfair, inequitable world which offends one'shuman dignity, in short, when \co{visible} evils acquire monstrous dimensions ofsocial or even metaphysical principles.\ftnt{One might be tempted to include  here most kinds of revolutionaries, many (often well meaning) social and other  reformers, as well as petty personalities like Gavrilo Princip,    %Nedjelko Cabrinovic, Trifko Grabez ... Black Hand and the like,  who cannot or do not want to distinguish the personal problems and diseases  from the socio-political ones.}  The evils in the world may be innumerable,but the conclusion that the world is evil is clear \co{sign} of\co{alienation}.  The idea of the best possible world is the most charming\co{conceptual reflection} of the understanding that neither God nor even theworld owes us anything -- least of all any reasons and explanations.    The world is good in the trivial sense that salvation is always possible. Inthis respect, the world needs no improvements. All the detailed improvements ofthe world can be needed for making the society more comfortable or more just,but that has nothing to do with God, for He is getting involved when, and onlywhen, personal salvation is at stake. The performances of televangelists prayingfor most specific items are certainly close to the peek of vulgarity. But weshould observe that a god who figures as a mere postulate of the sheer faiththat all my good deeds and my good life will be eventually rewarded with equallygood items according to a principle of justice, not to say, of just payment --such a god is, too, reduced to an honest clerk matching the list of my deedsagainst the list of \co{visible} wishes and goods.  \noo{Gl\"{u}ckseligkeit ist  der Zustand eines vern\"{u}nftigen Wesens in der Welt, dem es, im Ganzen  seiner Existenz, {\em alles nach Wunsch und Willen geht}, und beruhet also auf  der \"{U}bereinstimmung der Natur zu seinem ganzen Zwecke, imgleichen zum  wesentlichen Bestimmungsgrunde seines Willens.}  \citet{Happiness is the  condition of a rational being in the world with whom everything goes {\em    according to his wish and will}; it rests, therefore, on the harmony of  physical nature with his whole end and likewise with the essential determining  principle of his will.}{KantPrakt}{II:2.2.v [K224]} The pietistic oppositionof duty and nature, with the associated opposition of morality and happiness(which is merely \citetib{rational being's consciousness of the pleasantness of  life uninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence}{KantPrakt}{I:1.1.\para  3}) calls indeed for somebody who might guarantee at least some, and at bestultimate harmony, who might dose \wo{happiness proportioned to [\ldots]  morality}.\ftnt{As nature has been completely \co{dissociated} from the  spirit, and desires from morality, such a being \noo{soll den Grund der    \"{U}bereinstimmung der Natur nicht blo{\ss} mit einem Gesetze des Willens    der vern\"{u}nftigen Wesen, sondern mit der Vorstellung dises Gesetzes, so    fern diese es sich zum obsersten Bestimmungsgrunde des Willens setzen, also    nicht blo{\ss} mit den Sitten der Form nach, sondern auch ihrer    Sittlichkeit, als dem Bewegungsgrunde derselben, d.i.  mit ihrer moralischen    Gesinnung enthalten.}  \citefib{must contain the principle of the harmony of    nature, not merely with a law of the will of rational beings, but with the    conception of this law, in so far as they make it the supreme determining    principle of the will, and consequently not merely with the form of morals,    but with their morality as their motive, that is, with their moral    character.}{KantPrakt}{[K225]} One might probably look here for an attempt  to go beyond pure ethical formalism, although the attempt is left to God. The  hypothesis of God is needed, as usual, to make the \co{dissociated} parts fit  again; here, to make us believe that moral life can possibly pay off. This is  the cornerstone of pietistic dualism, and its abhorrence of the senses from  which it is unable to liberate itself, so that \citef{the moment the fool    gives up concentration\lin And his other spiritual practices,\lin He falls    prey to fancies and desires.}{Ash}{XVIII:75} The reward one expects must be  given not only in principle -- and not only%  where it is its own and highest reward --  in the \co{spiritual}, that is,  \co{absolute} dimension of life which affects its whole -- but also in all  particular wishes and projects which, for such a repressive consciousness, remain  for ever the all and only reality. \noo{ This pietistic \co{dissociation}, closely    related to its gnostic predecessors, is but a sick result of the suppression    of its dependency and} As if \citef{virtue itself and the service of God    were not happiness itself and the highest    liberty.}{SpinozaEthics}{II:49\kilde{p.125}}}%Unfortunately, such a guarantor of justice is not much better than one who canoffer to a rational being only an irrational hope of a new car or a plasticsurgery. Goodness of God is offered as the promise of salvation, as thepossibility of saying \Yes\ -- to God, and hence also to life in whatever formit meets one.

Let us only mention one more \co{aspect} which is constitutive forthe \co{experience} of God as \co{transcending} all the more particular\co{experiences} of \co{analogical} kind. The \co{analogues} like the ones wehave described so far can enter \co{any experience} and, in fact, find the most\co{actual} expression (as the \co{actually} {\em felt} wonder, thankfulness,presence, look from above). In no such \co{actual experiences}, however, onemeets a person.What makes one a person is the capacity to enter personal relations (as \nexus\ precedes its \co{dissociated aspects}, so here the adjective precedes thesubstantive, cf. quotation~\ref{ftnt:personCommunion}.) Personal relation is onewhich concerns the very center of Being, which is a true \co{communion},\co{sharing} of the \co{origin}.  This \co{communion}, this most personalrelation is possible in its deepest form only between persons. Only one personcan reach the personal-center of another, only one being \co{open} to the\co{origin} can meet another being in the same \co{openness}; only one personcan tell the name of another, for telling the name is exactly the sign ofrecognising the unique value of the person, which is but another side ofrecognising the \co{shared origin}.  A personal meeting is a meeting in the faceof the \co{origin}, is a meeting where nothing is left outside, that is\co{closed}, for what is being \co{shared} is the \co{absolute} beginning,\co{nothing}, that is, everything.%Person is the uniqueness of human \co{existence}.There is a habit (going back to Locke and Hobbes, if not all the way toAristotle) of insisting on more definite aspects which would constitute a person-- like responsibility, self-consciousness, rationality, freedom. But the onlyreason for it seems to be the forensic need for a more definite \co{concept},allowing us to distinguish persons from non-persons (sic!).  Saying \wo{He is  not a (mature) person for he lacks the basic sense of responsibility} or\wo{He is not a (legally responsible) subject for he lacks elementary  rationality} may sound quite reasonable, unlike, for instance, \wo{He is not a  person for he is not rational}. The parenthetical adjectives press themselvesinto the formulations, for being a person comes before and stays \co{above}being anything else, no attribute nor its lack can ever account for a human notbeing a person.  We have described in Section \ref{sub:concrete} the meaning of\thi{becoming what one is}, %how the personal-center can acquireof becoming through the \co{concrete  foundation}, so to speak, a full person, but this is a story aboutthe {\em kind of person} one might become and not of being or not being a person.Ontological \co{foundation} of human \co{existence} is equiprimordial with itspersonal character.  This \co{foundation} accounts also for the uniqueness ofevery \co{existence} but, with respect to the aspect of personality, thedecisive fact is \co{participation} in the \co{origin} which \co{shares} itself.\co{Confrontation} is the primordial event of such a \co{sharing} in which the\co{origin shares} itself with the \co{existence}, \refpp{pa:originShares}. It isthus God who \citet{makes of us a complete person and, consequently, in a  meeting with us is fully personal.}{TilUnbed}{I:4.Biblical religion and quest  of being.3.2} This making a {\em complete} person amounts to augmenting themerely ontological \co{participation} with the dialogue of \co{concrete  foundation}.  But primarily God makes us also a person, because \co{existence}is constituted by \co{participation} in the \co{origin}, emerges only in theface of Him, in a \co{confrontation} with Him.\ftnt{This seems to be the source  of the well known close  connections between personalism and some form of (typically Christian or  Judaic) theism.}  Strictly speaking,\co{nothingness} of Godhead has the non-personal, or trans-personal character of\co{self}. But this trans-personal character is at the bottom of the very beinga person.  It is itself non-personal, void of any \thi{essence}, the mere purityof the \co{distinction} of \co{birth}, and yet it is the personal center, it\co{founds} the fact of being a person, the \co{unity} of \co{existence}stretching all the way to the most \co{actual reflections}. The center ofpersonal being is not itself personal, and it is only by \co{confronting}something \co{transcending} one's personality, something trans-personal, thatone is a person.\noo{Just like every thing is only totality of what it is not.}This \co{confrontation} is the context but also the eventual content of personalrelation.  In it God Himself emerges as a person; firstly, by the verydefinition, by being involved into the personal relation, by being the\co{absolute} pole of the \co{spiritual} tension. \co{Spirit} is a fully\co{concrete} person or it is not at all. More \co{concretely}, God is a personbecause He says your name, because \citeti{your names are written in  heaven.}{Lk.}{X:20} God uses quite some part of the book of Genesis fortelling people what their names shall be: no more Abram, but Abraham, no longerSarai but Sarah, and Isaac, and no longer Jacob but Israel, etc.\noo{\citeti{neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall    be Abraham; [...] As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai,    but Sarah shall her name be. [...She] shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou    shalt call his name Isaac:}{Gen.}{XVII:5-15-19}::USED in BOOK I}%All these names, given by God, represent the personal character of the relation:in the act of naming, God establishes the person as a person.  From the verybeginning, He is not a mere technician constructing only the mechanism of theworld -- He addresses a person, long before any consciousness can \co{actually}grasp the fact.  \citeti{I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known  me.}{Is.}{XLIV:4} And He keeps addressing persons responding to the personalcalls and prayers or, as we might also say, to the deepest need of a person: theneed of reality, the need of help, the need of \co{grace}. He is a personbecause our only relation to Him can be personal, consummated in the depth wherethe center of our being meets the center of Being. Personality of God is theultimate expression of His highest relevance for life, is the \co{analogue} ofHis \co{presence} in the ultimate \co{communion}, \co{sharing} everything with everyone.\noo{\tsep{Arguments and proofs...}\pa\label{proofs}We could try to find an \co{analogical} element (only an element) of\co{openness} in the teleological proof, in its directedness towards the futuregood, but it might be asking too much from an all too shallow analogy.\noo{    it is wishing in order to obtain, it is expression of  \co{thirst}... -- it is goal of everything, what all \co{thirsts} for (as  Scheler observed, the hight of good in the hierarchy of values is  indisputable, even if what \co{actually} is good remains in most situation  imprecise) ; well,  as salvation, unity of   heaven and earth, and then, eventually, as \co{indistinctness}, death  (Mainlander?)... }Nevertheless, we have indicated that proofs of God's existence, correct orincorrect as they may be, have much more in them than the merely logical grid ofconcepts and constructions.Proofs of God, God's existence, reflect also insight into His {\em meaning} for\co{existence}.So sure, none of that is any proof. And they are not so clearly separated fromeach other, as simple logical analysis would do it with their formalexpressions.But they represent some of the most fundamentalobservations concerning human \co{existence}. As with the proof of Anselm's, we should be able to attach some meaning to otherproofs also, provided we adjust the interpretation of terms...}\subsub{No} It is the \co{spiritual} \Yes\ which calls forth, from the abyss ofGodhead, the generous and benevolent person of God.  \citet{How beautiful must  this appear to him who understands it; how absurd to the  ignorant!}{Perplex}{II:6} The \No, on the other hand, encounters only its ownnegativity which means encountering, in the whirlpool of distractions and\co{actualities}, emptiness.  \co{Attachment}, refusing to accept that \co{I am  not the master}, does not lend its characteristics to possible descriptions ofGod. The primary \co{analogue} of this attitude amounts to the simple conflationof \co{nothingness} and void -- beyond the \co{visible world}, there isemptiness. (And the antinomic character of this emptiness, permeating like etherthe whole world, does not change the fact that self-centered \co{attachment} cannot get rid of its ghost.) Yet, the {objectified} characteristics of therespective aspects -- of \co{pride}, \co{ingratitude}, \co{closedness} --carry a lot of strength, even if one is unable to say to what they possiblycould be ascribed -- to the world? to the life? to my life? to the proclaimedvoid surrounding all that? A bit to this and a bit to that, eventually, toeverything for \No, even when it remains most consistent, agreeable and conform,lacks the \co{unity} and finds its reflections in all scattered bits and pieces-- \citeti{smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.}{Zech.}{XIII:7  [Mrk. XIV:27]}\pa\label{adpride} \co{Pride} is not necessarily a personal pride, an individualattitude of superiority over others.  \co{Pride} is merely an attitude whichdoes not \co{recognise} any higher power, any \co{origin} beyond\co{visibility}.  The \co{analogues}, its {objectified} expressions, embrace somany \co{idols} that one can hardly attempt any enumeration.  The\co{objectivistic illusion} from I:\ref{objectivisticillusion}, the assumptionthat everything consists of {things}, eventually, of \co{objects}, is animportant example.  It underlies all kinds of intellectual arrogance, naive orsophisticated scientism, exclusive worship of causality and \thi{hard facts}.As has been frequently observed, humanism is another field providing a host ofexamples.  \citet{But how can anyone judge or love what he does not  know?}{Pico}{} -- this is, perhaps, the most concise summary of the firsthumanist manifesto. The real question, however, is what one understands by\wo{knowing} and what is there worth such \wo{knowing}.  In a sense, this textelucidates only some fundamental issues of our life -- it is humanistic.  Butthe adjective rings wrongly because the human nature is not so plainly and\co{visibly} human as many \thi{humanists} would like to see it.\ftnt{Although  the tone of \btit{The Oration} is certainly of the kind which could motivate  the later development of humanistic \co{pride}, one should remember that it  does not call for the simple reduction of the world to the merely  \co{visible}, human, all too human, dimension.  \citef{Let us disdain things    of earth, hold as little worth even the astral orders and, putting behind us    all the things of this world, hasten to that court beyond the world, closest    to the most exalted Godhead.}{Pico}{\kilde{quoted earlier}} Yet, although it  emphasizes that such a transcending is possible, it does contain the germs of  the latter anthropocentrism in which much of the humanism would like to  enclose humanity. The later in history we move, the more \co{pride} --  parading often as humility not only recognising but also, if only unwillingly,  accepting regrettable human weakness -- can be discerned in whatever  calls itself \wo{humanism}. The line separating the attempts to {know} the  full scope of human existence in order to live it most completely from the  attempts to \thi{know} it in order to control it, is often hard to draw.  \citefi{I am Satan, and deem nothing human alien to    me}{footnote}{\ref{ftnt:satanSum}} is a compact expression of the  multitude of attempts trying to liberate humanity from the \thi{inhuman}  subordination to uncontrollable forces, attempts based on the claims of  unlimited, because of lack of any \co{visible} limits, possibilities:  \wo{Human species [...] will once more enter onto the road of radical    transformation and will become an object, in its own hands, of the most    complicated methods of artificial selection and psycho-physical training.}  The authorship of this quotation speaks for itself -- \citeauthor*{Trotsky},  {p.229 \citaft{Walicki}{ p.368}} In the process of shifting \thi{human} to  \thi{all too human}, the category of \thi{humanism} has been appropriated by  forces and movements which even in the personage like Mother Teresa seem  unable to see anything beyond humanitarianism.\noo{Therefore, the above    reservations against the use of the word.}}%\pa\label{adclosedness}The {objectified} \co{analogue} of \co{closedness} may be expressed by thesimple statement \wo{The world is as it is}.  The facts are there, true,\thi{objective}, irresistible, and the only thing we can do -- at least, dorationally -- is to conform to them, possibly, to manipulate them so as toachieve our goals.  The apparent activity of such an attitude of smartnesstowards the givens is underlied by the fundamental, \co{spiritual} passivity,the all pervading resigned acceptance of givens as givens -- the world, afterall, is as it is.  It becomes stiff and rigid, not necessarily because it is howscience is forced to see it, but because it has been raised to the status of thehighest and only reality governed by the irresistible laws of \thi{hard facts}.Impossible as such laws may be to specify \co{precisely}, they spook behind allour failures and defeats which, obviously, must have some \thi{objective}reasons.%\pa\label{adingratitude}The {objectified} \co{analogue} of \co{ingratitude} is the image of life andworld as, if not basically and essentially so to a large extent, bad,mischievous, perhaps, even evil.  In the world we meet many things andsituations and most of them require an attitude of suspicion and scrutiny.  Sucha project can hardly fail; the field for Voltairean grimaces at Candide'sdisasters and the naivit\'{e} of Panglos' optimism is inexhaustible -- thegrimaces are so obviously convincing, that they will always appeal to theadolescent \thi{rationality} of the Enlightened flavor.  One will always findmany serious examples which can be used as strong reasons justifying ungratefulattitude, indeed, ridiculing any idea of \co{gratefulness}.  And, in fact, inmany situations one better stay alert. But there is a great difference betweenseeing a danger in the particulars of a situation, and seeing danger everywhere,between being wary of a person who creates an impression of dishonesty and beingwary of all people, perhaps, even of all people in general.  The suspiciousalertness is the fundamental modus of ungratefulness, reflecting and originatingin the general idea of the world rendered in terms of harm and reward; the worldwhich, unless one prevents it, will do one some harm. \citeti{Most are at odds  with that with which they most constantly associate -- the account which  governs the universe -- and \ldots what they meet with every day seems foreign  to them.}{Heraclitus}{ DK 22B72}%\subsubi{Subjective projections [go to \ref{sub:projections}]}\sep%\pa All the \co{aspects} of the \co{attached} \No\ express the opposition to theidea that it results from any choice, whether \co{spiritual} or not.

For indeed, to great \citet{absurdities men were forced by the  great license given to the imagination, and by the fact that every existing  material thing is necessarily imagined as a certain substance possessing  several attributes; for nothing has ever been found that consists of one simple  substance without any attribute.  Guided by such imaginations, men thought  that God was also composed of many different elements, viz., of His essence  and of the attributes superadded to His essence. Following up this comparison,  some believed that God was corporeal, and that He possessed attributes;  others, abandoning this theory, denied the corporeality, but retained the  attributes.}{Perplex}{I:51} All this, according to Maimonides, leads topolytheism for one is eventually forced to deify each separate attribute orelement of the divine essence. We would rest satisfied with the statement thatthis amounts to anthropomorphic image of God which becomes, indeed, a projectionof our forms of understanding.  This, \citeti{[t]he divine essence is nothing else but  the essence of man; or, better, it is the essence of man when freed from the  limitations of the individual, that is to say, actual corporeal man,  objectified and venerated as an independent Being distinct from man  himself.}{Feuerbach}{\citaft{Cople}{ vol.VII:II.15\kilde{p.296}}}It is easy to agree with the element of criticism against the naive, childishimage of God -- and here one agrees with Maimonides as much as withFeuerbach.\ftnt{And with many others, one of the first being Xenophanes accusing  poets of ascribing to gods all too human features: \citefi{They have narrated    every possible wicked story of the gods: theft, adultery, and mutual    deception.}{DK 21B12/11}{} The observation that \citefi{Aethiopians have    gods with snub noses and black hair, Thracians have gods with grey eyes and    red hair}{DK 21B16}{} summarises Feuerbach's reductions of theology to  anthropology.\noo{Of course, the philosopher from Colophon did not stop}} Butthe two part ways very quickly.  For while Maimonides, Xenophanes and mostothers criticise a {\em misconception} of God, Feuerbach identifies naivet\'{e}of such a misconception with the essence of religion.\ftnt{It might be very easy  to pretend that statements like \citefi{God created everything through me,    when I was in the ineffable foundation of God [...] If I were not, there    would be no God.

The difference concerns  only the presence of the ultimate \co{transcendence} behind such statements --  Godhead, after all is there, even if He acts only through me. Only this,  apparently minimal, \co{invisible} difference separates two incommensurable  worlds: that of an open religiosity and that of a denial and  reduction to \co{visibility}.}%Answering the accusation of a subjective projection one could mention severalthings.  \noo{1)}Firstly, even with respect to the brief quote from Feuerbachabove, the ontological argument remains: whence do we get the idea of ouressence (or anything) \thi{freed from the limitations}?\ldots Ideal limits areusual accomplices of unsuccessful reductions, of failed attempts to graspsomething higher. \noo{2)}More importantly, there is the category mistake,characteristic for the \co{objectivistic illusion}: \co{subject}-\co{object}distinction does not apply at all at the level of \co{invisibles}.\noo{  (II:\ref{sub:objsubj}, and then \refpf{pa:objsubjA}).}  Nobody is able tovoluntarily create the object of one's faith.  \co{I} certainly does not do it.So God, to the extent it arises from \thi{man}, arises from \co{his self}. Butthen there is no need to project it as \wo{an independent Being} because \co{my  self} is not \co{myself}, nor \co{self} is \co{my self}. Man is more than\co{himself}, \wo{man infinitely transcends himself.}$^{{\rm    II}:\ref{cit:manMan}}$ One cannot ascribe the \co{analogues} (taken asexpressions of the \co{spiritual} \Yes) any \co{subjectivity} because they reside notonly far \co{above} the \co{actuality} of the \co{subjective acts} but also\co{above me} and \co{my} whole life. The favourite triviality one might bringagainst the reality of such a \co{choice} would be the claim that everybody candecide it for \co{himself}, and this is what one means by \wo{subjective}. But,for the first, the fact that \co{I} can choose whether to kill my boss or not,does not make the alternatives of the choice, nor its consequences, anythingsubjective: whatever \co{I} choose, will affect the world in which we live (the\co{objective} world, if one insists).  But one would still object: \co{I} canchose, it is only {\em up to me} to decide -- there is nothing {objective},nothing \thi{outside} which forces me to choose one rather than other. This maybe true about usual \co{acts}, and \co{acts} of choice in particular, but notabout \sch. \co{I} do not decide, \co{I} can at most choose to consent to orreject its result. Its {objectivity} resides in its \co{transcendence} -- \co{I}do not create the alternatives, nor do \co{I actually} choose between them.\co{I} can only relate to them, for even if they do not stay \co{objectively}\thi{outside}, they by far \co{transcend} the sphere of \co{visibility}.\noo{3)} \Sch\ is not something \co{I} decide and make -- \co{I} only carry itwith \co{me}. Its reality is not consummated in any \co{actual act} (in such\co{acts} \co{I} can at most \co{reflectively} consent to the \co{choice} or tryto direct \co{myself} towards one of the alternatives) but remains constantly\co{above} \co{my} world. In this sense, as the fundamental \co{aspect} of\co{existence}, as the ever \co{present} possibility, it is much more{objective} than any \co{actual objectivity}.%\noo{Becoming conscious of it changes relatively little, and projects of  liberating oneself from it are only signs of a wrong \co{choice}.}\paBut, truly, it is not so that \Yes\ {\em sees} something that \No\ could not see;both {\em see} just \co{nothing}. The difference lies in the character of the\co{confrontation}, in that while \No\ finds nothing where there is \co{nothing}to see, \Yes\ finds the \co{origin}. This truth concerns \thi{the world} as muchas the one who recognises it, and hence it cannot be reduced to a mere \co{act}of comprehension, to a mere recognition of a factual, \co{objective} truth.There is, after all, \co{nothing} to see.  When one finds God it is not becauseone has traveled far enough and reached the insight, some new hidden truth. Itis because one has recognised that the very place from which one has not movedand the very things which have been around all the time witness to the divine\co{presence} and disclose it to one who is \co{open} to their silent voice.%\citet{Some people make believe to find God as a light or savour; they may find  a light or a savour but that is not to find God. According to one scripture,  God shines in the dark where every now and then we may catch a glimpse of him.  Where to us God shows least he is often most.}{EckLastWord}{} Those similesequating God with sun and our powers with eyes unable to look straight into itbecause of its overwhelming brightness, lead easily to imagining some\thi{objective} brightness to be sought \thi{out there}.  But this so imagined\thi{objective being there} reflects nothing more (nor less) than the constantpossibility of \Yes; \thi{objectivity} is a figure of speech signaling thisconstant \co{presence} independent -- just as the \co{objects}' temporalduration -- from our attention and recognition of it.  Beyond that the image of\thi{objectivity} may be deluding for it is \Yes\ which brings forth thebrightness, not (any \co{experience} of) brightness which \co{founds} \Yes.The ultimate sense of absolute {objectivity} of God emerges from \Yes\ andamounts to its invariable possibility. One may know or believe it, or not, onemay go around in complete indifference or despair, one may deny its verypossibility. No matter what one does, the possibility always remains, perhapsonly infinitesimal and almost disappearing, usually completely \co{invisible},but still a possibility.  All the things which we can manipulate and arrangeaccording to our wishes, are as pleasing as they are uncertain -- if they can bearranged, they can also happen to get dis-arranged.  But the indifference to ourattention, this non-relativity to being perceived or not, to being arranged ornot, even to being intended or not, is what one considers the most fundamentalcharacteristic of {objectivity}. Only that its certainty does not emerge fromany analyses, attempting to make it \co{visible}, but from \co{open humility}.The luminous face of God waits unmoved, unchanged, patient for being discovered,though not for being seen. And when it is discovered, it is discovered as havingbeen there all the time, waiting unmoved, unchanged, the same as it wasdiscovered for millennia ago and as it will be in all the future. The ultimatelycertain -- unchangeable, \co{shared} and objective -- is the ultimately\co{invisible}: \co{eternity}, the \co{presence} of the \co{origin}.Truth of a mathematical theorem does not depend on anybody personallyunderstanding it or not.\noo{ -- it is usually announced by the more able to the  less able ones.} Once proved, it remains an open possibility for everybodyinterested to figure out its meaning and recast its proof. The fact that most ofus never do, does not take any {objectivity} away from it. We may even need anoccasional reminder that the theorem does hold, in spite of our inattention.Even if its significance gets modified by the accumulated results and the actualcontext, it still appears as only an unfolding, an explication of the potentialcontained already in the statement of the theorem.  Certainty of its truth,encoded in the proof and accessible to everybody, is the same as it has beensince its discovery. Its truth is the same as it always has been and as italways will be.  Is there anything more objective, more certain?  Is there anymore absolute sense of truth?  \Yes, too, is such an \co{eternally shared} andever \co{present} truth. But its \co{concrete} proof has to be carried out againand again, anew by every individual \co{existence}. As long as it fails, thetheorem may seem incomprehensible or even false.% Augustum (semnon) jako dobro numinotyczne, prowokujace fascinans (subiektywna% reakcja); % There is no element of anthropopathism in \co{analogues} unless, of course, one% turns them into mere expressions of our feelings...
