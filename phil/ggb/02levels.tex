We have followed the order of ontological \co{founding}, of gradual\co{actualisation} of the \co{original} \co{virtuality}, of gradualdifferentiation of the \co{indistinct}, in short, of something emerging out of\co{nothing}. We have thus arrived at the level of \co{reflective}\co{experiences}, of the \co{dissociated objects} appearing within the familiarcircle of the \hoa.But familiarity and secure surroundings breed quickly, if not boredom, so somerestlessness, a thirst for a challenge of the unexpected, perhaps even for ameeting with the eldritch and uncanny. \co{Reflection}, occupied with its\co{dissociated objects} and their relations, remains \co{confronted} by the\co{non-actual} element of \co{experience} which keeps reminding it of, if notthreatening it with, the impossibility of a complete reduction and of bringingeverything under its control. In principle, one might imagine somefurther differentiation of the \co{reflective} contents which might, perhaps,offer new and more \co{precise} means of control. But this seems possible only,so to speak, in a merely quantitative way. Having reached the level of\co{dissociation} where \co{objects} are seen and manipulated incomplete independence from each other, where they appear as autonomous andself-contained \thi{substances}, there is hardly any further possibility ofdifferentiating the \co{indistinct}. Certainly, one need not accept any actuallygiven limits of \co{distinctions} as ultimate. A thing can be furtherdifferentiated into its properties and constituent parts, the parts can beinvestigated with increased \co{precision} leading to more and more minute atomsand particles which are \co{recognisable} only with the help of more and moresophisticated equipment. But all such differentiation yields only new\co{objects}, more of them and more particular ones, but still only\co{objects}. It does not establish any new hypostasis, any new level of\co{experiencing} with a character which would be qualitatively different fromthat of \co{reflective dissociation} -- it only increases the \co{precision} of\co{dissociated objects}.Therefore, we will not differentiate any further but will now reverse thedirection and consider the ways in which the ontological hierarchy of hypostasesis \co{reflected} in \co{experience} or, what amounts to the same, how\co{reflection} may organise the world.  We will thus proceed with thecategories of \co{reflection}, with some limits of \co{distinctions}, and movein the direction opposite to the order of ontological \co{founding}. Although\citeti{the way up and the way down is one and the same,}{Heraclitus}{DK 22B60}it looks and feels very different when walked up and down. We will follow therealistic (in the sense of I:\ref{sub:givens}) way bottom-up, but will also keepin mind the constant \co{presence} of all higher and earlier hypostases in every\co{actual experience}.% the importance of the original constitution will constantly disturb the% assumptions about the metaphysical status of any givens, things or essences.% \co{Reflective signs} are always permeated by the \co{signs} of the higher% levels -- in any case, by the \co{original signs} of the higher level.% The levels of Being, the character and the structure of each subsequent% hypostasis, are not only forms of \co{experience} but are part of% \co{experience} as well.  Through all the concreteness and specificity of% \co{actual} \co{experiences}, we are also confronted -- in the background,% underneath the \co{actual} contents -- with the \co{unity} of \co{experience},% with \co{chaos} and, eventually, with \co{nothingness}.  These, however, are% never \co{objects} of any \co{actual experience} -- being its \co{ontological%   foundation}, they only surround it and permeate it with their constant and% \co{invisible presence}.\noo{We will see that different kinds of \co{experiences} and their qualities  are closely related to, in fact, founded by the temporal scope of the context  in which they are placed.  The hypostases of Being, having resulted in  establishing temporality, even the experience of the objective time, are to  high extent reflected in the \thi{time it takes} to experience something.  }%%%%%%%%%%% Levels%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\section{The existential levels}\label{sec:levels}\secQQQ{8}{And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on earth, and thetop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending anddescending on it.}{Gen.

(Imagining the circle moving along the line, only the actual contentbut not the levels become affected by its actual position.) We can nevertheless, andconsciousness typically does, view itfrom a limited perspective of a single {level}, that is, within a definite temporal scope which determines the context of reference and thecharacter of the relevant contents. Each level is a \nexus\ of various\co{aspects} (in fact, \co{traces} of the \co{original separation}), among whichwe will address the following: %The involved aspects are:\begin{enumerate}\MyLPar\item\label{as:sig} the character of the \co{signs},  of the\co{actual} appearances, specific for the contents of a given level;%and determined primarily by the \co{distance} \item\label{as:cor} the correlate of the experience -- its \thi{objective pole},   the character of its contents; \item\label{as:sub} the character of the \thi{subjective pole}\item[{}](These last two   points only at the lowest level approach the usual \co{dissociation} of  \co{object} and \co{subject}; they could be better called \wo{origin} and  \wo{reflection}, if we have not reserved these words for other purposes.)\item\label{as:tra} the form of \co{transcendence} pertaining to the contents ofthe given level;there are two different aspects which, together, constitute the character of \co{transcendence}:\begin{enumerate}%\MyLPar\item the \co{horizontal transcendence} of the correlate, of the \thi{objectivepole} of \co{an experience} at a given level; as a variation of the \co{horizontal transcendence}, one will usually encounter the merely quantitative transcendence of other correlates withrespect to the \co{actual} one\item the \co{vertical} or qualitative \co{transcendence} which, referring to the \co{non-actual} aspects of the \co{experience} at the current level,  points towards the higher one. \end{enumerate}\end{enumerate}In \co{reflective} terms, the basic factor distinguishing the levels is thetemporal scope of the involved experiences: from the ideal timeless point, pure\herenow\ of a single \co{object}, through the finite and limited scope of \co{objective complexes}, then the finite but unlimited time of one's whole life,to the -- again timeless, but now living -- eternity, the immovable \co{presence} of the\co{origin}. Using this as the basis of distinctions, let us neverthelessremember that these differences are only indications of the whole \nexuss\ of\co{aspects} which distinguish various levels.\subsection{Immediacy}\label{sec:levelA}%\subsub{Temporal scope}\pa\label{pa:horizonImmediacy} Let us try to imagine a shortest possible timespan in which we can still experience, feel, sense -- discern -- something. Thequestion is not about how long this time would be, but about what would remainas the possible experience.  It might be, perhaps, a single sensation, apunctual, localised, feeling of pain, pricking, heat. It might be hearing anoise, a single sound, seeing a simple thing. It might be, perhaps, a singlethought, an isolated image, appearing instantaneously in our imagination. Itmight also be all such aspects together in one moment. The problem is, ofcourse, that although we have a sense of \thi{one moment}, nobody has aslightest idea what it possibly might be. It seems to have some experientialbasis but also, when \co{reflected} upon, it dissolves as the ideal limit of\co{immediacy}, the point of pure \thi{now}.  We would propose to call it \wo{a  shortest unit of experienced time} or, perhaps, \wo{a shortest unit of time  which can be referred to an experience}.  We are not asking, as Lockedid,\kilde{Essay concerning...II:14} if such a durational \thi{specious  present}, such \la{minima sensibilia}, can or can not be further divided intomore minute and \thi{objective} \la{l'atome du temps} of Poincar\'{e},\thi{quanta of time} of Whitehead or \thi{chronons} of some contemporaryphysicists\kilde{Dictionary of the History of Ideas:Internet} -- its\thi{objective} duration does not matter to us. We might think ofexperiential \co{immediacy} as the lowest level of distinguishing at which a childdevelopment turns and starts to consciously construct the world. It isimpossible to say when, exactly, a child leaves the state of relative passivityand becomes active because, as far as we can see, it is only a matter of degreeand none of these aspects ever occurs without the other. But we notice as theirritating (and sometimes charming) short attention span of babies and smallchildren becomes gradually longer and the child gets less and less determined bythe immediate presence of stimuli -- slowly, from the minute bits and pieces(which also arise all the time along the way), it begins to rise complexconstructions which reach beyond the \co{actual} givens towards the\co{non-actual} limits.\noo{This is the level of pure, ultimate \co{immediacy}.}\co{Immediacy}, left behind as the constructions proceed, remains however attheir bottom as that which is im-mediate because it has no time to bemediated. What is experienced \co{immediately} may vary, in particular, with thelevel of attention we pay to things but it will never last two hours, it will bealways comprised in a tiny, not to say infinitesimal, instant of time, at thelimit of \co{actuality}.  We will devote a few paragraphs to its experientialbasis but most of the section will be concerned with the status of the\co{reflectively posited}, ideal and infinitesimal limits.\subsub{The signs}%\titp{\Oss}\ad{Original signs}\label{sub:originalSigns1}The \co{sign}, the \os\ of such an \co{immediate experience} is not announcing anything, or better, it is announcing itself and only itself. Whether it is \thi{subjective} or \thi{objective}, whether it is sensed pain, heard noise, felt dread, perceived object, imagined thought, it is a \co{sign} which fully coincides with the signified. It has been \co{cut out} of the horizon of \co{experience} but \co{attentive reflection} has not yet had time to carry out its \co{representing} explication. When I get burned by a glowing spark thrown out from the fire, I do not experience a sensation {\em and} a spark, it is the spark which hurts me, I might cry out \wo{Ah, {\em it} burns!}\thi{It} is equally the spark and the place of my body where it burns. We are not here after any phenomenological intentionality. On the contrary, within the temporal scope of \co{immediacy}, there is hardly any difference whether the \co{sign} has some \thi{objective} or else only \thi{subjective} correlate. The \co{sign} and what it possibly signifiesmay be, perhaps, distinguished by subsequent \co{reflection}, but they coincide in the \co{immediate experience}. There is no intentionality and the experience has the form of a pure \thi{state} with a definite quality (pain, warmth, meekness, etc.)\pa An \co{immediate sign} coincides also with the reaction, if any.  Pain, likethat caused by a burning spark, is {\em nothing else} than the \co{immediate}withdrawal, or attempt to withdraw, reaction of avoidance or defense which,typically, is taken care of by the autonomous part of the nervous system.Similarly, a pleasant sensation is nothing else than the response of my body toits attraction. (This may become \co{reflectively} realised first whenthe pleasant stimulus withdraws and I have to attempt to approach it, butoriginally, there is no distinction between the pleasant stimulus, itsattractive force and the reaction of \thi{approaching it}, \thi{preserving it}.)Such reactions are {reflexes}, that is, elementary \co{reflections},involving an extreme narrowing of the focus to this particular, isolated point.Bergson, identifying sensations with perceptions of one's body, says it thisway: \citet{The psychical state, then, that I call ``my present'', must be both a  perception of immediate past and a determination of immediate future. Now, the  immediate past, in so far as it is perceived, is, as we shall see,  sensation,[...] and the immediate future, in so far as it is being determined,  is action or movement.}{MattMem}{p.138.\kilde{See also p.57} The immediate past  and future, so aptly related here to receptivity and action, which Husserl  turned into retentions and protentions, are results of analysis which has  placed such an \co{immediate experience} in the idealized, objective time or,  as Bergson would have it, of duration.  But we do not intend to develop a  theory of sensation and perception and will stay with the mere quality of  \thi{my present}, \co{immediate experience}.}%Re-action, this \co{act} or movement which follows within the \co{immediacy} ofsensation, is what we call \wo{reflex}. It involves both receptivity, the re-, inso far as it is triggered and not mediated, and also activity, the -action, inso far as it is actually doing something, performs some movement.There is no subject of such an event. Sure, it is I who experience the pain, butin its \co{immediacy} it is not even relative to {\em my} body, but merely to aparticular sense, particular organ, particular point of the body. Its minutelocalisation refers it to the reacting organ which, so to speak, only happens tobe mine. The experience itself does not involve myself, only the affected placeof my body.  In fact, a more \co{reflective act} is needed to refer such \co{an  experience} to a subject, to myself. As long as I do not perform it, I\thi{drown} in the \co{immediacy} of \co{an experience} and {reflexes}, which only\la{post factum} appear \thi{as} mine.%\titp{\Rss}\ad{Reflective signs}\label{refl:A} \co{Reflection} happens always within the\hoa, but it may bring within this horizon \co{signs} of different things. Thequestion analogous to that asked in \refp{pa:horizonImmediacy} would be now:what can \co{reflection} focus on in a \thi{shortest possible moment}, orbetter, what kind of \co{reflection} would make its \co{object}, not only its\co{sign}, closest to itself? It would be directed toward some \co{actual  object}, present \herenow, not to \thi{Prague}, \thi{meaning of life},\thi{love}. And then, it would not be a \co{reflection} which contemplates howthis \co{object} is, what it is like, etc. It would be a mere registration that\thi{\ldots}, \co{that it is}.One can sometimes experience the astonishing fact {\em that} this something in frontof me {\em is}, that it at all {\em is}. Existentialists made such experiencesinto a nauseous feeling of unbearable, meaningless presence but it may also be quitea detached and full of gratitude realisation \co{that it is} while it might notbe. The question \wo{Why is there something rather than nothing?} may be givenother connotations but it, too, expresses such a\co{reflection}, the amazement at the mere {\em fact} of this something being atall.  The experience simply reveals object's naked \co{immediacy},the mere fact %(ignoring its being so-and-so, coming form here or there)\co{that it is} -- fully \co{actual}, in front of me, \thi{out there}. This idea, underlying the whole \thi{metaphysics of actuality}, has here itsconcrete, experienced form. \co{Reflection} \co{that it is} shares with the\oss\ the full consummation within the pure, experientially unextended\co{immediacy}.  But as \co{reflection} it is, of course, already doubled. The\co{object} of such a \co{reflection} appears in total \co{dissociation}, thestrangeness of its being at all is, in fact, the strangeness of its being here\thi{on its own}, of its being so strangely alone \co{before} -- more in thespatial sense of \thi{in front of}, rather than of temporal precedence -- oragainst the \co{reflective act}. Thus, the \rs\ does not any more coincide withits \co{object}. But \co{reflection} does not have time to \co{reflect} over the\co{distance} which remains merely \co{experienced}. It is for \co{reflection}simultaneously its \co{act} and the appearing \co{object}, both coinciding inthe infinitesimal limit of \co{immediacy}.% \co{Reflection}, in particular, \co{attentive reflection} must posit % an \co{object}. Whether it is a sensation, a perception, an object of % perception or a cause of sensation does not matter much here. What % matters is the \co{immediate} presence of this \co{object} for % \co{reflection} which merely experiences \co{that it is}. Acts of % such \co{reflection} build upon the \co{immediate experiences} and % their \oss, but only in that that they narrow the \hoa\ % to pure \co{immediacy}, to the \wo{shortest unit of experienced time}.\subsub{Substances, objects, particulars}\label{sub:substances}\label{sub:idealImmed}%\pa An \co{object}, appearing in the \co{reflection that it is}, appears as asubstance to which belong \wo{both separability and <<thisness>>}, as the\citet{ultimate substratum which is {\em no longer} predicated of anything else;%that which is not predicated of anything,  but of which all else is predicated}{AristMeta}{V:8; VII:3}, as \citet{a  complete indivisible being.}{LeibnizArnauld}{to Arnauld 28.11/8.12 1686.  [In  whole this section, we exclude living beings from our considerations.  Likewise, here we have to exclude the specificity of Leibniz' notion of a  substance which ends up with a monad (corresponding roughly to our  \co{existence}). Here we are only concerned with the characteristics one was  expecting substances to have.]}%A {thing}, a physical {thing} of daily experience is a paradigm of an\co{object}. And the word \wo{object} is particularly significant for it bringsa {thing} out of the context of such \co{an experience} and places it in thecontext of \co{attentive reflection that it is}.  What it achieves, or in anycase attempts, is reducing the object to a dimensionless residuum, emptying itof any specific content and merely suggesting its \thi{being there}, pure\thi{substantiality} stripped of all \thi{accidents}.  It reduces the\co{actuality} of a {thing} to a mere indication of something definite (even ifindefinable) and \co{cut out} from the surroundings, an independent \thi{being  there}. It reduces a thing to a point.The intuitions of Leucippus and Democritus in this respect, motivated by thematerialistic reductionism, can hardly be overestimated. The Greek\wo{\gre{atomon}} means indivisible, and the speculative theory of atomism isthe first tribute paid to the idealized notion of a \thi{substance}. It capturesthe abstract idea of the least and eventual building blocks of the universe in amuch clearer, if abstract, language than the elements inherited by the Ionianphilosophers of the ultimate nature from the earlier religiousthought.\noo{Physis is all-embracing soul and divine, i.e., has close to nothing  in common with our nature. \wo{was a soul-substance, a supersensible and yet    material thing, which was embodied in this or that element, rather than    identified with it (though on this point our information is, naturally, not    always clear).

Whether these are identified with sensations,perceptions, clear and precise ideas, objective things, atoms, elementaryparticles, quarks or strings are secondary distinctions. They all move withinthe horizon of \co{immediacy} under the evanescent shadow of the ultimatesimple, \citet{that bounding point [which] indeed\lin Exists without all parts,  a minimum\lin Of nature.}{Things}{I:5}\pa\label{pa:subIndependent}\label{pa:subUnchange}\label{pa:DescartesKnow}All the criteria for something being a \thi{substance} are gathered in, andsometimes follow from, this ideal limit of a pure point. But primarily they justreflect the characteristic features of a limit of \co{distinctions} solidified as a positiveentity. We mention only a few examples. %independent The isolation of the \co{object}, its definite \co{dissociation} from thehorizon of the surrounding \co{experience}, gives rise to the idea of its completeindependence and self-sufficiency, its existence \thi{on its own}. Thisindependence is immediately given in the \co{reflection that it is}. It can be observed when we notice how a{subjective} feeling, say, a sensation, becomes independent in a similar waywhen it is posited as an \co{object}. An \co{immediate} sensation of pain givesthe possible \co{reflection} a localised focus but it is still my sensation, itis still a sensation involved in the context in which it arises. As I\co{attentively dissociate} it from this context and \co{posit} it as an \co{object}of \co{reflection}, consider it \thi{as it is in-itself}, in short,\co{externalise} it, it loses its concreteness and appears gradually as a moreand more depersonalised \co{external} entity, whether an independent substanceor an atomic impression. %\pa\label{pa:subUnchange}A related aspect of sedimenting \co{dissociated distinctions} as a positivelimit or, eventually, of positing an ideal point as a measure of reality, concerns temporality. On the one hand, point gains the place in the, by now objective, time as the ultimate \thi{now}.An \co{object}, imagined if not intended, posited if not thought as a pointbecomes itself a timeless event, it resides in the purified \thi{now} which, bythis reduction which is also abstraction, has become \co{dissociated} from time.  Asubstance, abstracted in this way from time, appears (shall we say,necessarily?) as a solidified, unchangeable being.  It appears so not by anyanalogy, not because it is permanent or because we have extrapolated to itobservations of something relatively constant, but because it has been pulledout of time, confined to an ideal, timeless point of a pure \thi{now}.%\pa\label{pa:DescartesKnow}Another aspect of this timeless permanence, of thedeterminacy of isolated independence is the idea of a perfectly clear, unambiguouspresence (or absence) of the point, that is, of a perfectly clear and unambiguousknowledge. Idea of such a knowledge is, originally, with Aristotle orthere about, merely another side of the idea of a substance: well-defined,clearly cut out, independent and self-same entity. It would be pointless tofollow the historical development of this idea, but we can remark thateventually, with the emergence of epistemology, with Berkeley or Descartes, itgives rise to the idea of knowledge coinciding with its \co{object} -- no longerin the way intellectual realm of Plotinus or Scholastics contained eternalintellections being self-same with their objects, but just as in the\co{immediate experience}, the \co{original sign} coincides with the signified.The hunt for the infallible, certain knowledge is a companion of the hunt forthe ultimate atoms: both emerge from the idealization of \co{immediate  experiences}, from the narrowing of the \hoa\ to the idealized, pure\co{immediacy} of a point.\wtsep{dissolution}\pa\label{pa:pointUnknown}Paradoxically, but also very naturally, a point \co{posited} as the residuum of\co{objective precision} and infallible knowledge is also the limit of any possible\co{distinctions}, that is, of comprehensibility. \thi{In itself} it isunknowable, not however because it hides the ultimate content from us but, onthe contrary, because it does not hide anything which could be\co{distinguished}, and hence known. Thus, \co{positing} the points of theultimate \thi{substances}, one \co{posits} by the same token the unknowable\thi{things in themselves}. Those pointing out how Aristotle's thinking was determined by the structure ofthe Greek language and common sense, might certainly observe that the attemptsto capture the idea of a substance end up with the attempts to define what, inthe daily language, counts as {things}.  And they end badly. That which \wo{is  first in every sense -- in definition, in order of knowledge, in time}; thatwhich can exist independently from all else; \citet{that which is primarily,  i.e. not in a qualified sense but without qualification}{AristMeta}{VII:1} --all that threatens with disappearance in nothingness.  Already in the IV-thcentury St.~Basil suggested: \citet{Do not let us seek for any nature devoid of  qualities by the conditions of its existence, but let us know that all the  phenomena with which we see it clothed regard the conditions of its existence  and complete its essence. Try to take away by reason each of the qualities it  possesses, and you will arrive at nothing. Take away black, cold, weight,  density, the qualities which concern taste, in one word all these which we see  in it, and the substance vanishes.}{Basil}{I:8}Indeed, \citet{there is no body of which I can say for certain  that it is a substance rather than an aggregation of several substances, or  perhaps a phenomenon.}{LeibnizArnauld}{to Arnauld, draft, 28.11/8.12 1686} Aparticular can be analysed as consisting of other, more minuteparticulars as any \co{distinction} can be refined by more\co{distinctions}. What's wrong with the famous heap of stones? What does it lack to be a respectable \thi{substance}? Any inherent principle oforganisation? A genuine unity? A substantial form? What does not lack all that?If it turns out that this very heap of stones was set up on purpose as asignpost, will it acquire some of these lacking aspects? And if not then,perhaps, when it turns out that not only it was not just a heap functioning as asignpost, but that its exact form and the number of stones had specific meaning?\thesis{\label{th:noindividual} There are no such metaphysical entities as\thi{substances}, \thi{particular things}.  A particular thing is a~\ldots\co{cut} from \co{experience} {signified} within the \hoa.} %A particular thing is a limit of \co{distinctions}, is a place at which thepossible process of further \co{distinguishing} is terminated, or in any case,suspended.\ftnt{The \thi{ultimate difference} of Duns Scotus seems to carry the same  intuition, even if richer associations. Although one might classify specific  difference (constituting the being of a species) and even transcendental  difference (contracting \thi{Being} to the ultimate genera or categories) as  instances of \thi{ultimate difference}, eventually, it amounts to the  \la{haecceitas}, the individuating being and, in fact, to the mere indication  of \thi{a being}, \thi{a thing}.\kilde{ScotWolter,ftnt.3,p.166} Of course,  within the mind-things dualism, it has never been clear whether such  differences are external beings (as Scotus typically maintains) or not. This  latter opinion is the ultimate consequence drawn from Scotus by Ockham who  ends up with the dogmatic empiricism: dogmatic, in the sense of postulating  the objective existence of individuals (and only individuals) which it never  manages to specify, with all other differences and universals being mere  abstractions of the mind. We suspect that this, like any other dualism, must  eventually dissolve {\em both} opposite poles, in this case, also the   individuals which end up as mere substantial residua. But we often find in  Ockham's reduction of several notions to a single being or concept, a simile  of our way of viewing such differences as \co{aspects} of one \co{nexus}.  Thus, for instance with respect to the current point, \citef{unity is not an    accident really distinct from that which is one, and added to it in reality    outside the mind.}{OckSumLog}{I:c.xliv (Though Ockham makes a reservation    that he only explains -- and does not necessarily subscribe -- to this    view.)}}  Particular thing as a limit of \co{distinctions} -- which isgrasped or, in any case, signified within the \hoa\ -- can be equated with thisthing being everything it is not, being the totality of \co{distinctions} whichare excluded and left outside this limit. In this sense, opposites create eachother, though such a \wo{creation} need not be limited only to opposites.\wtsep{limits of distinctions}Violence creates mildness, hardness creates softness, repulsion createsattraction (as well as indifference), etc.. Likewise, though in much morecomplicated ways, very advanced \co{objects} may enter the \hoa\ which, too, aredetermined only as limits of \co{distinctions}.  The early church created Greekrationalism, Jerusalem created Athens, not in all respects but exactly in therespect of its opposition to Jerusalem; Luther and Protestantism createdCatholicism, etc..\ftnt{\label{ftnt:binary}In general, there may be a whole  series of contraries and not just a binary opposition. Blue does not create  red, but not-blue, not-yellow, not-... all together give red. All colors  mutually condition each other, arise by mutual distinctions from each other.}\wo{Creates}, well, of course all such particular things might have existedbefore: mildness might have been the general mood of life {\em until} the firstact of violence interrupted it; the church was catholic and Trent only made manyof the points of its faith more precise against the Protestants whom it, inturn, created as one entity from the dispersed groups fighting each other, asthe opponents of the Catholic church. \wo{Create}means often in such contexts a degree of sorting out, perhaps even makingconscious and precise, that is, \co{actualising} some \co{distinctions} andmaking them more \co{precisely visible}. But \co{actualising} and making\co{visible} means that the \co{distinctions} have already been made; the samekind of \co{recognising} a \co{distinction} takes place at the deeper levelswhere, indeed, the \co{distinction} enters the world for the very first time.And it does so by being \co{distinguished} from everything else.For although \thi{everything else} is initially, as we have emphasised in BookI, the background from which the \co{distinction} arises so, once the\co{distinction} has been made, it functions in opposition to all other\co{distinctions}. \pa Leibniz: \citet{Fictions of the mind, everywhere; and if we cannot discover  what is truly a complete being, or a substance, we will have no stopping-point  [...]}{LeibnizArnauld}{to Arnauld 30.04 1687.}  Indeed, there is nostopping-point.  Yet, the lack of any underlying \thi{substances} does not meanthat \co{distinctions} and their limits are \thi{fictions of the mind}.  On thecontrary, they are discoveries -- \co{distinctions} of and from the\co{indistinct} -- found and not created, even if found only by the\co{distinguishing existence} and hence relative to it.  Relativity meansneither arbitrariness nor subjectivity.  Some of \thi{things} are more practicalto fix as \co{objects}, to stop their further differentiation; mostly, thosewhich are prone to be perceived within the \hoa.  In the \co{attentive  reflection that it is}, it is \thi{me} who determines the termination of sucha process. But for the most, the limit of \co{distinguishing} is determined bymy body, by the sensory and perceptive system, by the intellectual criteria ortradition.  The common character of these systems makes it natural that \thi{we}mostly agree as to what counts as particular things.  Starting from such a basis-- and consensus -- one may abstract universals, common natures, constructessences, as well as introduce distinctions. But at the bottom of it anything --a piece of chalk, a chair, a leg of the chair, a heap of stones, redness,anxiety, Prague, independence, love -- may be \co{posited} within the \hoa, thatis, turned into an \co{object} and thus given the status of a particular. Thisdoes not mean that particularity is a fiction of the mind -- only thatmetaphysics of particular \thi{substances} is an enterprise of a very limitedvalidity founded on the equally narrow basis as the metaphysics of actuality.\co{Distinguishing} stops somewhere, usually, for purely pragmatic reasons. Itis much easier to handle a {sofa}, a {coffee-table} and each of the four belonging {armchairs} as separate objects than to consider the whole as aone and indivisible \thi{sofa group}. But, of course, the latter is possible,too, as is the case whenever you must buy the whole group instead of only onearmchair which you actually like and need. Every \co{object} admits further\co{distinctions}, the group contains sofa, and table, and\ldots, likewise achair has all the parts, not to mention a house, the church, the state. Thelimit surrounding the \co{object} has nothing metaphysical or absolute about it,it can be pushed further up or down, depending on thecircumstances.\ftnt{\citef{But what are the simple constituent parts of which    reality is composed? -- What are the simple constituent parts of a chair? --    The bits of wood of which it is made? Or the molecules, or the atoms? --    \wo{Simple} means: not composite. And here the point is: in what sense    \thi{composite}? It makes no sense at all to speak absolutely of the    \thi{simple parts of a chair}.}{WittPI}{I:47} Wittgenstein's examples in the  following paragraphs are quite illustrative.}  And thus one has never managedto specify a single \thi{substantial form} of any \thi{substance}. For\thi{substantial form} is not an inherent property possessed objectively by a \thi{substance}, but the mere fact that we have to and hence always do stop\co{distinguishing} somewhere, that even if the process can always be continued,it is always suspended at some point, though the points may vary.\ftnt{\wo{[For]    each particular there exists at least one monadic universal which makes that    particular just one, and not more than one, instance of a certain sort. Such    a universal will be a \wo{particularizing} universal, making that particular    {\em one} of a kind.} This does remind strongly about the \thi{individuating    entity} of Scotus. But we do not intend to discuss the point any further and  only notice that such questions were asked not only by Plato, Aristotle or  Scholastics but are still topics of fervent discussions. The quotation is from  \citeauthor*{ArmstrongUniv}{ 64} \citaft{AristSubsUniv}{}} What determinesthis point may be very strange in any particular case and quite different indifferent cases.\pa One thirsts, of course, for the universal consensus and keeps looking, but theclosest approximation one manages to get is when one resorts to the common\co{objects} of perception. And even there one finds the obvious differences andimpossibility of establishing any final and positive \thi{substantial form}.The positive characteristics, supposedly the primary and elementary, are in factsecondary results of \co{reflective dissociation}; they emerge at the end of theoriginal process of \co{distinguishing}. Of course, theprocess establishes elaborate structure of \co{distinctions} so that, when webegin to \co{distinguish} the chair from the table, we are already in the roomand not in the desert, when we begin to \co{distinguish} the concept of a groupfrom that of a monoid, we are well within the mathematical curriculum and not inthe forest, so that \co{reflection} does not have to explicitly negate the nature,then a forest, then this forest, etc., in order to arrive at a monoid.Every \co{distinction} is a boundary, creates two poles of the \thi{inside} and\thi{outside} or, perhaps, just \thi{left} and \thi{right}. We would thus gofurther than Lotze who says that a thing is what it does -- a thing iseverything that it is not. If this seems paradoxical, than observe that thewhole work is done here by the word \wo{everything}. A thing is but {\em the  sum} of all that it excludes, the limit of \co{distinctions} from all that{\em it} is {\em not}. This is the whole \thi{positive essence} of anything andknowing one is the same as knowing the other. In this sense, everything indeedreflects the whole universe, every word means something specific only in thecontext of all other words, microcosmos of every particular reflects the wholemacrocosmos.  This is also what makes it possible to dissolve (or as one saystoday, \wo{deconstruct}) any issue, any concept, any theoretical constructionand so called \wo{understanding} -- in short, any identity -- in the infiniteweb of correlations, themes and exclusions by a systematic, that is, mercilessanalysis.\pa\label{pa:pragmaticPositive} But one might still object for, afterall, it is so obviously natural to think in positive terms. Standing in front ofa house nobody thinks an infinite series of not-\ldots No, but\co{distinguishing} is much more than thinking, not to mention \co{reflective  attention}. We certainly distinguish this house from what surrounds it, thisis what makes one see this house at all. Learning the concept of a group, nobodythinks an infinite series of not-\ldots, no, one thinks perhaps a monoid andadds a few axioms. But this only means that, making new \co{distinctions}, weusually introduce them within some given context, whether the context of\co{actual} situation, the context of discourse, the context of mathematicaldefinitions and concepts we have acquired, in short, within some \thi{positive}determinations. But there are some things to observe here. The first is that allthe examples (mentioned here, and usually mentioned elsewhere) concern\co{reflective distinguishing}, that is, \co{distinguishing} which starts withsomething given. This \thi{something given} is the \thi{positive} background towhich some more \thi{positive} attributes are added, as one used to say, it isgenus to which one adds \la{differentia specifica} or, as the case may be, aspecies to which one adds accidents of material nature to obtain thisparticular. But where does this \thi{positive} background come from? It is {\em  already} \co{distinguished} from other \thi{positive} backgrounds, the\thi{positive} backgrounds mutually limit each other. Well, perhaps, but one maystill claim that there is something inherently \thi{positive} which accounts forthis mutual limitation. Our point is that all the \thi{positive} content arisesonly as the limit of \co{distinguishing} it from others. The \thi{positive}character of the givens is the simple matter of efficiency.Having $n$ distinctions which, in general, divide the space independently fromeach other, we obtain up to $2^n$ distinct sub-spaces, each one given by acombination of positive or negative (\thi{left} or \thi{right}) value for eachof $n$ distinctions.\ftnt{Limiting, for the sake of simplicity, the attention to  binary \co{distinctions}, cf. footnote~\ref{ftnt:binary}.  Admitting  \co{distinctions} with up to $k$ contraries does not affect the argument: we  only replace the basis $2$ with $k$.} (If we denote distinctions by$d_1,d_2,\ldots,d_n$, and the \thi{left}, respectively \thi{right}, side of $d$by $d^-$, respectively $d^+$, then a sub-space $s$ corresponds to a choice$d_1^{s1}d_2^{s2}\ldots d_n^{sn}$ where each $si$ is either $+$ or $-$.) A newdistinction will give $2^{n+1}$ sub-spaces, i.e., every new distinction amountsto the exponential increase in their total number. Thus if we were to identifyevery particular thing by the set of {\em all} \co{distinctions} separating itfrom all the rest of the world, we would be exposed to this exponential growthwhich would quickly put a limit to our finite abilities.% But assume that some $x$ of the $2^n$ sub-spaces are more relevant% and more frequently used or encountered. Or even better,But assume that we now want to make a distinction $d$ which is relevant onlyrelatively to one -- call it $s$ -- of all the $2^n$ sub-spaces. (E.g., we onlywant to distinguish blue from yellow, that is, our current $s$ is the sub-spaceof colors.) In principle, it would require a new level of $2^{n+1}$possibilities from which only two are of interest: those {\em within} $s$ whichlie on the \thi{left} or on the \thi{right} of the new $d$. Having fixed $s$,perhaps giving it a name, perhaps associating with it something more than that,in short, turning it into a \thi{positive} entity, we may now refer to the newpossibilities as $sd^+$, respectively $sd^-$, instead of the whole sequences$d_1^{s1}d_2^{s2}\ldots d_n^{sn}d^+$, respectively $d_1^{s1}d_2^{s2}\ldots d_n^{sn}d^-$.  Explaining to somebody what \wo{yellow} means, we do not start bysaying that it is not a body, nor the taste of lemon, nor the view from MountEverest, nor\ldots We start by saying that it is a color -- this limitsimmediately the horizon of attention to the relevant sub-space.\ftnt{This, by  the way, may be necessary even if we were to attempt an ostentive definition,  as observed in \citeauthor*{WittPI}{ I:27-28}.}  Thus, stopping the\co{distinctions} at some points and assigning to their limits at these points\thi{positive} determination -- which simply forgets the chain of negationswhich constitute it -- reduces the burden of explicitly handling further{distinctions} which are to appear {\em within} these, not \thi{positive},sub-spaces.  The \thi{positive} determinations allow one to forget the --enormous and typically \co{reflectively} unknown -- number of \co{distinctions}which, although present, would only disturb dealing with the \co{actual object}confusing the context with a multitude of irrelevancies. Nevertheless, themutuality of \co{distinctions}, their full series behind the \thi{positive}determinations, can always be invoked and sometimes even used to disturb thediscourse.% This is the case, for instance, whenever the problems with agreeing on the% meaning of some terms require constant refinements, new associations and% distinctions. Other examples are provided by the situations where subject and% predicate can be freely switched, both expressing the same intention:% deliberating desire or desiring deliberation, square circle or circular square,% violent love or loving violence.\wtsep{summarising...}\pa Thus, although we grant the positive determinations with their eventualexpression in the idea of a \thi{substance} all practical value, we view themexclusively as such: pragmatic devices. The ontological status of\thi{substances}, \thi{substantial forms} and the like is, like of most otherthings, the same as their epistemological status, which in this case is: thelimits of \co{distinctions}.%Rather than the negatively sounding\la{Omni determinatio est negatio.}\ftnt{Let us only remember that living beings are  excluded from the present considerations. We should also recall, from  I:\ref{sub:pantheism}, our objections to pantheism which might seem weakened  by the above phrase. We are now working with some established  \co{distinctions}, within a differentiated world where, indeed, choosing some  determinate contents amounts to excluding others. With respect to our earlier  development in Book I, the more appropriate formulation would be \la{Omni  negatio est determinatio}. The two can be accepted jointly as expressions of  the dual aspect of \co{distinction}: by drawing a border, splitting the space  in two, it both negates (whatever falls \thi{outside}, \thi{to the left}) and  determines (whatever falls \thi{within}, \thi{to the right}).}%positive form: \la{omni negatio est determinatio}. We bring thus, indeed, elements of negative theology into the trivial matters,traditionally treated easily by the positive finitude of the Greek dislike foreven the slightest smell of \gre{apeiron}.  Certainly, a possible and mostnatural issue for discussion and investigation is {\em where} the \co{actual}limits are drawn and what \thi{positive} contents they determine. But as theAristotelians have spent on that few thousands years, we could hardly contributeto the discussions in any way.  Above all, we consider their focus slightlymistaken because they are almost always underlied by the \co{objectivistic}assumption of studying the \thi{real}, the \thi{substances} and \thi{essences}.We do not believe in metaphysical status of some absolute \thi{substances}, wedo not take the particular things as something more primordial than the \hoa.Nor vice versa.  For just like a particular thing is no ultimate\thi{substance}, so neither is the \hoa, in the present case, the\co{immediacy}, \thi{the shortest unit of experienced time} any absolute unit --it is just an \co{aspect} of \co{an experience} of a particular thing.  The twomutually condition each other, form a \nexus, a whole system of correlated andmutually dependent \co{aspects}: an \co{immediate actuality} is constituted by\co{an experience} of a particular thing, and a particular thing would neverappear if it were not \co{dissociated} and narrowed down to the horizon of\co{immediate actuality}.%\subsubi{Idealizing immediacy...}%\noo{Although such a \co{reflection} is still an experience, there is a very  short way from it to the well known ideal, unexperienced constructions.    \say ??? \Rss\ are but \co{dissociated} \oss; though the former may also be  invented by \co{reflection} for purposes of re-creating the unity of  \oss\ldots ?    \say Idealization is a twofold process. On the one hand, it is but  \co{dissociation} carried to an extreme. Such a \co{dissociation} always calls  forth other elements, something which might account for the interrelatedness,  totality, eventually unity of the whole. This additional elements appear as  \thi{ideal} entities \co{posited} beyond the sphere of \co{dissociated}  contents. Often, they will correspond to the \oss\ which get lost in the  process of \co{reflective dissociation}. Examples involve all kinds of  \thi{limits}, whether in Kantian form of \thi{regulative ideas} which account  for the \co{experiences} of unity, or else in pragmatists' equation of reality  with the \thi{ultimate fixation of belief}. They are typically effects of  scientific bias (with Kant, Pierce, Comte) which would like to bring  philosophy \citt{to a condition like that of natural sciences}{Pierce,    Selected\ldots p.184}    They are indeed only \thi{ideal} entities which have no \thi{real} existence  from the point of view of the \co{actuality}\ldots Eventually, they are  expressions of \co{objectivistic illusion}, or its variants, which restrict  the sphere of \thi{real} to some limited and relative sphere\ldots }The eventual dissolution of any thing, as its supposedly accidental features andproperties are being removed, is now a standard objection against the verynotion of a \thi{substance}.  We share it and, as stated in\refp{th:noindividual}, do not find \thi{out there} any solid and indissoluble\thi{substances}. But we find them everywhere where our thoughts, perceptions,feelings, \co{acts} and \co{activities} stop for even a shortest moment,bringing out of the \co{chaotic} flow of \thi{transitive parts} of time the\thi{substantive parts} which can be retained and carried over to the nextmoment, I:\refp{pa:rest-flow}.  The idea of a substance has a solid foundationin the elementary operation of \co{reflection}, in the observation \co{that it  is}, in this \co{reflective positing} of a being as the limit of\co{distinctions}. It is a constant \co{aspect} of \co{experience}, the resultof the real, actually performed, \co{acts} which comprise the horizon ofattention to the extreme limit of \co{immediacy}.\pa The idealization of {things}, their reduction to \co{objective},\thi{substantial} points affects an analogous reduction on the side of the\co{subject}. Historically, a lot of time and \co{reflective} effort has beenneeded to fetch the \co{subject} out of the cave where it was put along with the\thi{subjectivity}, sophistry and the like offenders of objectivisticseriousness.  The idea of a purely \co{immediate subject}, a \co{subject} whichno longer has anything to do with human existence but merely with the logic ofuniversal -- and as momentaneous as timeless -- constitution, may appear as theextreme offense to this seriousness but, as a matter of fact, it only recognisesa \co{subject} which is a true accomplice of the \co{immediate} givenness of the\co{object}, which resides within the equally narrow, whether temporal or spatial,horizon.  It emerges with the epistemology of Cartesian \la{cogito} and reachesits peak with the problematic of constitution within German idealism.  Thetranscendental subject operates always in the ideal \co{immediacy} of anunextended point, its \co{object} appears in the \co{immediacy} of a single\co{act} which, carrying the burden of the constitution of the whole world,becomes as complicated as it is instantaneous.  Contents appearing at a point\co{dissociated} from its surroundings, from its temporal and spatial context,appear as arbitrary or, whenever one wants to effect more positive connotations,as spontaneous.  The mad spontaneity of an \co{immediate} \co{subject} is justthe other side of the arbitrariness of the \co{object} emerging -- no matterthrough how intricate meanders of transcendental constitution -- \la{ex nihilo},not even in the \co{actuality} of \herenow, but in the ideal limit of pure andtimeless \co{immediacy}.  Consciousness -- whether Descartes' cogito, Kant's\thi{I think}, Fichte's Ego, Husserl's transcendental consciousness or Sartre'sfor-itself -- is \co{actual} through and through, is an \co{immediate},instantaneous -- and by the same token, or rather {\em only in this sense},spontaneous -- \co{act} of constitution of an \co{object}.  Spontaneity of this\co{act} of endowing with form (in-forming?) is, as we just said, only anotherside of the arbitrariness of the appearing matter -- both \co{aspects},\co{dissociated} from the surrounding background of \co{experience}, find noother justification beyond the positive connotations of the word\wo{spontaneous} which, in fact, could equally well be replaced by\wo{whimsical}.\subsub{Transcendence}\pa \co{Reflection that it is} experiences the transcendence of its \co{object}primarily as its \co{externality}.  We could almost say that it is nothing elsethan such \co{an experience} of \co{externality}, that \co{externality} is theuniversal content of every \co{reflection} which merely notices \co{that it is}.This is even the case with the spark which burns me. Although the \co{sign},\co{object} and {reflex} coincide temporarily, the very localisation, the verynarrowing of the horizon of the event and reaction, amounts to\co{externalisation} which becomes apparent in the moment I direct my\co{reflective attention} to it. It is not me, it only affects me; it does notinvolve me, only a part of my body. \co{Externalisation} does not have anyinherent connection to extension or space, only to the narrowing of the temporalhorizon to \co{a} minute, \co{immediate experience}. It is the eventuallyabstract minuteness which constitutes the sense of being somehow foreign, notquite mine, \co{external}. The aspect of \co{spatiality} enters this relation assimultaneity, in that the \co{external object} is experienced simultaneously and\thi{as} simultaneous with the \co{subject} of this very experience.This simultaneity, however, has all the ambiguity of different levels. It isindeed co-extensional with the \hoa, but it also harbours the \co{reflective  act} which, narrowing this \co{horizon}, arrives \co{after} its contents. Thisdissonance between the \co{immediacy} of the given \co{object} and its temporalsliding in the \co{reflective after} is exactly the experience of\co{externality} with the germinal element of non-\co{actuality}, the mostelementary form of \co{horizontal transcendence}.\noo{  Nevertheless, as we saw, \co{externality} involves also an element of  \co{non-actuality} which gives such \co{objects} the character of  \co{transcendence}.  Of course, \co{objects} of \co{immediate experiences} can  also be spatial, in which case their \co{externality} is the \co{immediate}  presence of their \co{non-actual} \thi{parts}, like the back-side of a  building, given in protention and retention.}\pa\label{pa:madSpontaneity}%%%%%%%???????We have also pointed out the character of double \co{dissociation} involved in\co{externality}, I:\refp{pa:doubleSep}. On the one hand, \co{externality} is an\co{aspect} of consciousness encountering its \co{object} as distinct fromitself, which amounts to the same as self-consciousness, I:\ref{sub:selfAware}.But the sharp distinctness of the \co{object} from consciousness is but anotherside of its \co{dissociation} from the background, from its \co{experiential}origin.  An \co{object}, imprisoned within the horizon of \co{immediacy}, hasbeen \co{dissociated} from everything else. Its independence, its being entirely\thi{on its own} is, on the one hand, the apparently constitutive feature of its\thi{substantiality} and, on the other hand, its fundamental lack, its abstractunreality.  The strangeness of an \co{object} appearing in the \co{reflection  that it is}, the strangeness of its being at all is, in fact, the strangenessof its being here \thi{on its own}, of its being so strangely alone.  The\co{virtual signification} makes itself thus particularly strongly felt alongwith the \co{external objects} -- their \co{externality} is the ultimate\co{trace} of \co{signification}.This unreality, which is both a part of the \co{immediate experience} as suchand of the \co{reflective} attitude towards it, is the \co{vertical aspect} of\co{transcendence} involved here.  An \co{object dissociated} from itsbackground and surroundings, a pure \thi{substance}, appears as a spontaneous(arbitrary) fact \co{that it is} -- as intriguing as it is meaningless.  Notonly has it no reason to be so and not otherwise -- it has no reason to be atall. \wo{{\em Why} is there something rather\ldots?}  This may give rise to theexistentialistic {nausea}; but it may also be grasped with a gratefulfascination or detached thankfulness.  However, these later cases are possiblebecause they already involve more than the pure \co{immediacy} of the given,because they already witness to the \co{vertical} dimension of\co{transcendence}.\ftnt{Although one might be tempted to apply here Hegelian  schemata, there is no need for such. The situation itself is here abstracted  from \co{experience} and, if it appears meaningless and unsatisfactory, it is  only for a special kind of \co{reflective} attitude. The \co{vertical}  dimension of \co{transcendence} is here only another level of experience, is  \co{the experience} in the context of which this \co{immediacy} found place.  It is not something towards which the Spirit is driven by the force of  dialectical negation -- at best (or, rather, at worst) it is something towards  which philosophical reflection is driven by whatever force drives it.}\noo{ Doubt... -- goes to level-2 of mediacy; so does reference to Wittgenstein  on certainty (the burden rests on those asking such questions...)    \twot{other objects}{\co{complexes}, meaning (as `purpose', relation);    `absolute separation' = meaninglessness; \co{that it is so-and-so}} }\noo{???  \pa The \co{reflection that it is} is an intense, concentrated  experience -- it breaks the undisturbed continuity of natural experience,  pulling out of it something unnecessary and purposeless but, at the same time,  strange and fascinating -- the fact \co{that it is}.  But this possibility of  \co{attentive reflection} is \co{founded} on the already \co{reflective    dissociation} of the contents of \co{experience} -- the \co{reflection that    it is} only confirms it and brings it to the focus. \co{Reflection}, and  \co{attentive reflection} in particular, encounters some \thi{substantial    forms}, some \thi{given atoms} -- they are simply a constitutive \co{aspect}  of \co{reflective act}. \co{Reflective experience} is, to some extent, built  on such \thi{atoms}, namely, to the extent the \co{experience} is  \co{reflected}.  But, as we well know, \co{reflection} does not capture the  whole \co{experience}. Primarily, it cannot account for many \co{unities}  which are \co{experienced}, but which are not encountered \co{reflectively}.  The tension between \co{experienced unity} and \co{reflectively dissociated    totality} is constitutive for the whole \co{reflective experience}. We have  seen its first manifestation in the tension between the limits of  \co{distinctions} (where the apparently negative character referred all the  time to the ultimate \co{unity} of the \co{indistinct} background), as opposed  to the \thi{positive entities} of \co{reflective attention} (whose apparently  positive content witnessed only to the \co{reflective dissociation}). We will  encounter {traces} of the same tension throughout the other levels of  gradually wider and wider temporal scope.}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ACT\subsection{Actuality}\label{se:mediacy}\label{sec:levelB}Let us now consider much more mundane cases of what, in the more common sense ofthe word, would be called \wo{experiences}; situations which are not reduced toa single moment but which are organised within a relatively short, yet not \co{immediate} time span; \co{experiences} with a finite andlimited but no longer extensionless temporal scope.\subsub{Complexes} \pa\label{th:complact} Entering a room for the first time, Iacquire first a vague, general impression of its character. It may be ugly,cosy, warm, cold, dark, pleasant\ldots After a few moments in the room, myexperience of it changes in that I now become more attentive to its variousaspects and parts. Looking around I notice the arrangement of furniture, thecolors, fracture of the walls etc. At the same time the room itself recedes inthe background, I no longer perceive the room but this window, this corner, thisarmchair.  If, however, suddenly asked ``How do you like this room?'' I can atonce posit the whole room as the totality to be addressed. I can now analyze itsaspects and point out their interplay, but the object of my talk is the room. Itis both a unity and a multiplicity. If I try to see all of the room I willeasily fail, if I try to embrace simultaneously all the details I have learnedabout it in one act, I can, at best, summarise them in a general impression.Very often, if not always, the very same impression I had on entering theroom. But I know that this totality is composed of much more than thisimpression, this \os\ which is all of the totality of the room that I can\co{actualise}.A room exemplifies what one typically considers to be objects of experience.\co{Actual experiences} involve not just isolated \co{objects} but their\co{complexes}, also in the sense that a single \co{object} may appear as a\co{complex}, either a totality of some parts, or a unity involved in aninterplay of relations with other \co{objects}.  No such \co{complexes} are morefundamental than others.  Before a child sees that a chair can be moved awayfrom the table, the two can be experienced as one \co{complex}; one, becauseneither is yet definitely \co{dissociated} from the other, and \co{complex}because itself internally differentiated.  A picture hanging on the wall is notpart of the wall, nor something on it -- there is neither a picture nor a wallbut a totality of one \co{complex}. Once we have learned that chairs and tablescome separately and that different pictures may be hang on the same wall, welive with the immediate consciousness of these \co{complexes} whenever weencounter them. But this is the end rather than the beginning of the story.\thesisnonr{A variety of aspects% does not appear as one \co{complex} because it, % somehow \wo{objectively}, is one \co{object}, but itbecomes one \co{complex} whenit is \co{cut out of experience} as both differentiated beyond the \co{actual}givens and yet posited as one \co{totality} within the \hoa\ through a unifying, \co{actual sign}.}%\ (cf.~\ref{th:hoa}).}In this sense, \co{complexes} are like \co{objects} which emerge not due to anymetaphysical \thi{substantial form}, but due to their particular relation to the\hoa.  The constitutive feature of \co{complexes} is that, while they are\co{recognised} as \co{totalities}, sometimes even as \co{objects}, they presentthemselves, so to speak, incompletely; although given in \co{an actual  experience}, they are not fully \co{actual}, they are always \co{signs} whichcarry with them more \co{distinctions} slipping out of the \hoa.\ftnt{To refer  to protentions and retentions again -- one might argue that everything is a  \co{complex}, that every experience, every perception involves this kind of  sliding away out of the \hoa. But such an argument would be based on the  idealization postulating an idealized scope of the \hoa, namely, an  extensionless point. By its very nature, it cannot contain anything and so  everything must slide away. Thus, it would have to reject the \co{immediate    experience}. We do not reject it, though we claim neither that it is  temporally extensionless nor that it has any privileged epistemological  function -- it allows for further differentiation and \co{dissociation} into  ever more minute idealities.}\pa The word \wo{thing}, which was used for a correlate of an \co{immediate}experience, should not mislead one to think exclusively of a thing.  Itsconstitutive feature is that, appearing within the \co{immediate} limit of the\hoa, its experience coincides with its \co{sign}. Its self-identity, its\thi{substantiality} is a derivative of that.  In practice, a {thing} may bealmost anything. When I enter a new room, my first \co{immediate} experience isnot of furniture, walls, pictures etc. but of \thi{???} which then turns out tobe~\ldots this room. (At least, as long as there are no unusual objects which,attracting my attention, would prevent me from seeing the room.) I do not lookattentively into each corner, contemplate the ceiling, the floor, in order tofinally conclude ``Yeah, it is this room''. At first, it is \thi{???}, that is,the {thing} of my experience and it is, of course, no thing in the usual sense.It becomes more like a usual thing when I realise that it is actually the room,though then one may at once start asking the questions about unity and\thi{substantiality} of an \co{object} versus \co{totality} of a \co{complex}.The {thinghood} or \co{objecthood} of something is constituted by thepossibility of grasping it fully (that is, without experiencing that anythingwas left outside) in one \co{act}.  The \co{complexes} may be,\thi{objectively}, the same things. But in addition to being experienced as\co{objects}, involving merely unity, their experience involves alsomultiplicity, \co{totality} of aspects or elements.  The experience of\co{complexes} involves therefore not only their \co{objective} unity but alsothe experience of their being complex, even if not of their full complexity.\subsub{The signs}\label{impressConcept}The involved \co{signs} refer not only to the immediate\thi{givens} but also to the {aspects} which, at the moment of experience, arenot present within the \hoa\ -- and are experienced as such (like all the partsof the room which I know are there, which I have seen and registered, but whichare not \thi{given} in the same way as those I am \co{actually} looking at). Thedifferences between various \co{signs} of \co{complexes} concern primarilywhether they focus on the aspect of unity or multiplicity involved in a\co{complex}.\ad{Original signs}%I wake up and feel strength, a lot of vital energy, a joyful vigor. Is it the sunny morning which is the cause of that? Was it the light supper yesterday evening? Is it\ldots? It does not really matter. Hopefully, it will last the day long but it may also easily disappear very shortly. No matter what its reasons might be, the \co{mood} does reveal to me something, if not anything specific then, in any case, \thi{how I am now}. And this both reflects and will be reflected in my perception of the situation, for I will act differently (even if doing the same things, say, while getting up and preparingbreakfast) than I would if I woke up and felt fragile, feeble and low.I leave the house, drive to the city, park my car and enter a cafe.  I amenjoying the perspective of a quite hour over a cup of coffee and a good book.The coffee I get is not exactly the best, but it is not enough to spoil the\co{mood}.  Unexpectedly, I see a friend approaching my table. He asks how longI have been here, how I came here, where I parked my car. At this moment Irealise that I locked my keys in the car. Oh sh...t! The \co{mood} of theexpected quietude disappears suddenly and I am getting upset. What makes me so?Not the keys locked in my car because, in themselves, they are too little toruin a nice hour. It is the whole \co{complex} of the situation, the anticipatedtrouble, perhaps, the money I have to pay, the spoiled hour at the cafe. Thesimple fact of locked keys is certainly the focal point of the whole situationbut my being upset unveils much more than this simple fact, this single\co{impression} unveils the significance of the simple fact which has beenplaced in a broader, \co{complex} context of related facts and consequences.Calm voice of my friend, reassuring me that it is no big problem, we just callthis and that number, wait outside smoking a cigarette and they will come andopen the car, helps a lot. One could say, he only rationalises away my\co{impression}.  Indeed, but how? By bringing into the situation aspects,points of view, possible solutions and, not least, his calm attitude, which alltogether modify the \co{complex} and, consequently, my \co{mood}.\pa The \oss\ of \co{actuality} are all kinds of such \co{moods} and\co{impressions}.\ftnt{One might say that, for instance, \co{moods} are lasting  \co{impressions} or draw even more specific distinctions. We will not, however,   attempt to differentiate here any further.} They are direct and originalin the sense that they can be experienced without the respective \co{complex}being \co{actually} given.  In fact, they often appear before the respective\co{complexes}.  I can get a feeling of fear without knowing exactly what isfrightening me.  I can be in a bad mood without knowing exactly why.  In thisrespect, \co{moods} are typically not accompanied by the respective\co{complexes} at all, they merely announce~\ldots well, my general \co{mood}.% \co{Impressions} will more often have the associated \co{complex}% given along with them though \co{moods}, as lasting \co{impressions}, may too% have recognisable origin.\ftnt{Multiple examples can be found, for% instance, in M. Scheler (e.g. ???)  or W. James who treats them under% the heading of \thi{conjunctive relations} (e.g., Essays in Radical% Pragmatism:III.The Thing and Its Relations).}The border between the \co{impression} and the \co{complex} it announces may bevery vague. The difference between a \thi{violent passion} and a \thi{passionate  violence}, between an \thi{intense curiosity} and a \thi{curious intensity}, between a \thi{distasteful food} and the\thi{disagreeable taste} is as discernible as it is negligible. %In the evening we are sitting with some friends around a table in a pub havingan enjoyable conversation about nothing. After some time the neighbour who wassitting on his own joins in. There is some intense curiosity in his eyes and asif slight irritability in the way they search through the whole place. But heseems to be doing quite well in joining and, in fact, modifying theconversation. After a few questions and answers he focuses on somethingparticular one of us said and follows it up with more and more detailedquestions. \wo{So what did you really mean by that?}~\ldots Hmmm. \wo{Was it this orthat?  But then, you see, you would have to say that\ldots} His interest seemsa bit uneasy, perhaps, impolite and too detailed but so far there is nothingdirectly wrong with it. And nothing wrong happens later on, either. Afterleaving the place, all of us have the same \co{impression} of the guy with asomewhat inquisitive attitude, as if afraid of unveiling his own meanings;interrogative, perhaps not quite a Porfiry Petrovich but still a bit like adetective.  It is impossible to say at which point this \co{impression} started to make itself felt. Was it when he started to askthe questions? Was it when he joined our conversation? Even earlier?  Likewise,it is impossible to say to what precisely this \co{impression} refers. We couldmention a lot of small examples, things he said, ways he looked but it is notthe mere sum of such minute particulars. Saying \wo{the detective} means muchmore the \co{impression} he created than any of his \thi{objectively given}features.  Of course, there is far from here to any judgment of the person, butthe \co{impression} has already painted a whole, even if incomplete, picture.Referring to him, we will now say \wo{the detective}.\pa%multiplicity through unity of an impressionWe can thus list three characteristic features of the \oss\ at the currentlevel.  These \co{signs} announce the \co{complexes} lending them their unity,they comprise a \co{totality} of a \co{complex}, a situation or an object, intoa unity of one \co{sign}, the distinctive quality of the \co{mood} or\co{impression}.  An \co{impression}, \citet{an emotion is always a simple  predicate substituted by an operation of the mind for a highly complicated  predicate.}{PierceFourIncap}{III;p.58\label{ftnt:simpleComplex}} This is the fundamental role of \oss\ of \co{complexes}, and also what distinguishes them from their \rss.Another common feature of all the above examples is that the given \co{mood}allows a certain variation of more minute impressions, of perceptions and\co{immediate} sensations.  More generally, one can experience the same\co{mood} in different situations. The \oss\ of \co{actuality} may be as ifincarnated in a variety of lesser forms. \citet{Every one knows how when a  painful thing has to be undergone in the near future, the vague feeling that  it is impending penetrates all our thought with uneasiness and subtly vitiates  our mood even when it does not control our attention; it keeps us from being  at rest, at home in the given present.}{Pragm}{I;p.13} A more pervasive\co{mood}, like that induced by the pending expectation, may allow formodifications of more minute \co{moods} and, in particular, for a largevariation in the sensations, perceptions and \co{immediate signs}.%-- not directly reactive = unclear object/causeFinally, we also notice the less reactive character of \co{impressions} ascompared to \co{immediate signs}.  \co{Impressions} do not constitute\co{complexes} -- they are both \co{aspects} of \co{actuality} and the lattermay also appear without associated \co{impressions}. But any \co{impression}indicates a \co{complex}, a \co{cut} from the \co{experience} which, through the\co{impression}, receives a unified \co{sign}. This \co{complex} may be, infact, close to indistinguishable from the very \co{impression} announcing it.Thus, \co{complexes} have a very wide meaning: a table, a room, a situation, twoweeks in Prague, inquisitiveness of a person, all are examples of\co{complexes}, of things which are differentiated into aspects and varioussides, but which, nevertheless, appear as \co{totalities}, as focal points ofall the involved differences. The interplay of these differences is the\co{mood} or, the \co{mood} is what gathers the interplay of {\em just these}differences.\ad{Reflective signs}\label{pa:rssA}%\co{Moods} and \co{impressions} give the \co{complex} a unified \co{sign}through which the \co{complex} appears within the \hoa.  The corresponding\co{reflection} will no longer stop at the mere observation \co{that it is} but will nowobserve \co{that it is so-and-so}; it will go beyond the \co{attentive} positingof something that merely is, and surround it with all kinds of accidents,predicates, properties. \co{Reflection} differentiates the unityof a \co{complex}, the unity of an \co{impression} into multiplicity of itsaspects and elements.  Eventually, \co{reflection} creates lists, lists ofproperties, aspects, features, and then tries to reconstruct the totality of the\co{complex} out of these scattered parts. We will call these \rss\ of\co{complexes} \wo{\co{concepts}} and \wo{\co{thoughts}} -- \co{totalities} organisedaround a unity which, however, for the \co{attentive reflection} remainstypically only a mere \co{sign}, an ideal limit.\ftnt{Again, we are not  interested in any (im)possibly detailed analyses of thought processes and  their dependence on the available and unavailable concepts. We allow ourselvesto conflate the thought and the concept, just as earlier we conflated the\co{distinction} understood as the act of distinguishing and as thedistinguished content.}These words have here a broad meaning. There is nothing particular in a \co{concept} except that its unity gathers a collection of \co{actually}discernible, more or less \co{precise} characteristics. %\noo{The mental elements involved in perception, especially, the elements which are\thi{filled in} into the incompletely perceived object, will often be\co{thoughts} in this sense.}%Discussing the detective or the locked keys, one will collect a whole series ofthoughts which make up the important aspects of the situations.  Eventually, thewhole \co{complex} may become a single \co{thought}, although this will merelymean establishing a simple \co{sign}, like ``the detective'' which now, in atruly artificial fashion, signifies the respective \co{complex}.  There may be adifference between \thi{the detective} taken as such a \co{concept} or as an\co{impression}, but then it concerns the psychology but not the content.  Foreven the artificiality and \co{vagueness} of the \co{concept} \thi{the  detective} has most serious fundament in the experienced content whichconverges at the unity of the original \co{impression}.  In a sense, to be a\co{concept}, a \co{sign} has to be \thi{primitive} -- it must draw a set of\co{distinctions} as a unity, no matter how coherently or incoherently, howlogically or illogically they are related and how explicitly or implicitly thisunity appears.\ftnt{This unity, which lacks any {\em conceptual} unity, together  with the fact that its \thi{content} is the respective experiential limit of  \co{distinctions}, are the reasons why almost no \co{concept} is definable.  For instance, \citef{\thi{doorknob} is primitive (unstructured); and, for that    matter, so is too practically everything else.  [every other    concept]}{Fodor}{VII;p.147} Yet, this primitive undefinability concerns only  the unity, the line where the limit of \co{distinctions} is drawn; it does not  mean that various concepts are completely independent from each other, that  \wo{[s]atisfying the metaphysically necessary conditions for having one    concept {\em never} requires satisfying the metaphysically necessary    conditions for having any other concept.}\kilde{p.14} If one claims that  \wo{a mind that has only one concept (say, \thi{doorknob}) is a metaphysical    possibility}, then one obviously means by \wo{metaphysical possibility}  merely the lack of logical impossibility. Such a claim is only yet another  example of empirical atomism whose epistemic flavour quickly pollutes also  ontology.  }\pa Just as an \co{impression} \wo{is always a simple [\co{sign}] substituted by  an operation of the mind for a highly complicated  predicate}$^{\ref{ftnt:simpleComplex}}$, so a \co{concept} substitutes a \thi{complicated predicate} arrived at by analysisfor the simple \co{sign}.\ftnt{The Latin \la{conceptus} reflects well the  tension between the unity of the origin/embryo (retained in the English  \wo{conception}) and the multiplicity which it gathers and stores as in a  container.}  Thus, psychologically, the two are incommensurate: at any \co{actual} moment, it iseither \co{concept} or an \co{impression} but never both. If, involved in asituation, one tries to observe the arising \co{impressions}, they will getpolluted and falsified; \co{I} can not \co{reflectively} catch, not to mention,control \co{myself} in the moment of getting an \co{impression}. Tryingsomething like that, dissolves all \co{actual impressions}, makes them withdrawbehind the imposed \co{reflective} contents. Likewise, proceeding with aconceptual analysis, \co{I} can not pay attention to the \co{impressions} which,possibly, accompany it in the background.  A \co{concept} is an\co{externalised} intuition, an \co{impression} \co{externalised} as a list ofits most minutely discernible aspects. The two may appear in any order and thetransition between them is rather smooth -- the moment when a \co{thought}, or aseries of \co{thoughts} becomes an \co{impression} or vice versa is oftenimperceptible.Yet, although the two can not be \co{reflectively} posited and observedsimultaneously, they can always go together.  It is not only that, sometimes, one  can talk oneself out of an \co{impression}, not only that a unified \co{impression}already contains the possible results of decomposing it into a series of\co{thoughts}. Every \rs, every \co{thought} {\em has} a \co{mood}, it creates an associated \co{impression} which reflectsthe unity posited by the \co{thought}. (Of course, receptivity to and above all thesignificance one attaches to such\co{moods} may vary tremendously.) \citet{Every concept in our conscious  mind, in short, has its own psychic associations. While such associations may  vary in intensity (according to the relative importance of the concept to our  whole personality, or according to the other ideas and even complexes to which  it is associated in our unconscious), they are capable of changing the  `normal' character of that concept.\noo{It may even become something quite    different as it drifts below the level of consciousness.}}{MHSJung}{p.29}%In fact, it need not drift anywhereEvery system of {thought} has a \co{mood}, every philosophy has, besides itsmore or less intricate hierarchy and system of \co{concepts} and ideas, ageneral \co{mood} which hangs like a cloud above and flavours its more specificaspects.  And sure, just like my understanding of the situation with the lockedcar keys influences my \co{impression} of it, so will one's understanding of aphilosophical system influence its \co{mood}, the shape and the density of thecloud.\ftnt{This \co{mood} is like the \co{sign} of typical experience  underlying the given philosophy (provided that it has character -- for as  Nietzsche says: only \citef{[i]f one has character one also has one's typical    experience which recurs again and again.}{BeyondGE}{70})  Say, for example, the {mood} of Heidegger: gnostic thirst for the  hidden truth and resentment over its absence in the lower world and among  fellow men; the mood of Nietzsche: unrewarded intensity turning into violent  despair, heroic scream lost in the darkness; the mood of Spinoza: he who is  satisfied with oneself need not judge others, but deep satisfaction with  oneself is not from this world; the mood of Wittgenstein was accurately  described as empirical mysticism or, perhaps, mystification of empiricism; etc., etc.  Finding such superficial and general characteristics insufficient does not  change the fact that one,  nevertheless, \co{recognises} their origins, one understands the \co{mood}.}\newp \ad{Essences}\label{pa:essences}As being, the fact \co{that it is}, has been delegated to the limit of anextensionless and incomprehensible simplicity of a point,\refp{pa:pointUnknown}, there must remain some positive content which can beassigned to such contentless points, there must remain some \co{distinctions}which could justify \co{distinguishing} one thing from another.  There is alsothe problem with the exponential growth of the number of thenegative, exclusive \co{distinctions} which can be restricted to a smallernumber of inclusive, positive determinations, \refp{pa:pragmaticPositive}.These two, only apparently quite unrelated, problems of coping with the idealpoints which reject to cease being multidimensional \co{complexes},  arehandled by \co{dissociating} being from its character, the existential from theintelligible, the mere fact of being, \la{esse}, from that which makes a beingwhat it is, \la{quo est}, i.e., the forms or \thi{essences} of beings.\ftnt{Although  the distinction has been present before, it comes clearly forth in the  existential focus of Aquinas, who builds much of his philosophy on the  refinement of the Boethian distinction between \la{quod est} and  \la{quo est} by  adding to it the third term, \la{esse}, accounting for the observations like that  \citef{I can understand what a man is or what a phoenix is and nevertheless    not know whether either has existence in reality.

But it is  equally that which makes this being be what it is, it constitutes its  ontological place in the reality.} The goal, if not the achievement, of\thi{essences} is to reduce a \co{complex} to something which can be adequatelygiven in the purely \co{actual}, ideally, \co{immediate} intuition.  An\thi{essence}, whether with Aristotle, Descartes or Husserl, is a graspable unitwhich can be made \co{actual} in a single \co{act} of intuition, comprehension,perception, understanding, or whatever variation of a \co{reflective act} onewanted to utilize.  The supposed \thi{essences} were to give metaphysicalrigidity and \co{precision} to the \co{distinctions} of \co{experience}, were toturn \co{distinctions} into \co{precise}, rigid distinctions.  And\co{precision} is but another word for \co{immediate} \thi{givenness}. An\thi{essence} is the \co{reflective} hope of \co{immediacy}.\ftnt{\thi{Essences}  correspond only to the intelligible \thi{substances} and, in fact and  eventually, to the intelligibility of \thi{substances}. (One should probably  keep in mind that the original Greek \gre{ousia} can be, and in various  contexts is, translated as either substance or essence; Aristotelian  \gre{hypokeimenon}, \thi{that which underlies}, is translated either as  {substance} or as {subject}.) Their role, and ambiguity, lies in the narrowing  of ontology to the horizon of epistemology, that is, of \co{actuality}, in the  attempt to make the two coincide.}\noo{ Providing thus a basis for the sphere of intelligibility, they are  intimately related to sufficient reasons, efficient causes and all the other  means of the attempted reduction to \co{actuality}, coverage of the possible  differentiations by final, closed definitions. The reduction amounts to the  faith that if everything consists of \thi{essences} and their interplay, of  positively definite and closed entities interacting which each others, then  there is little reason to suspect that these interactions are of entirely  different character and can not be exhausted by an analogous modeling. On the  other hand, when the \thi{interacting} entities do not have final definitions  and, having lost their \thi{essence}, can always unveil a new and unexpected  side, then also the conditions influencing their \thi{interactions} get  loosened, and one can hardly guarantee the effects expected of the sufficient  and efficient reasons.  }\newp\pa\label{pa:understand=limit} However, to understand something is not to graspits supposed \thi{essence} but to know its limits. It can amount to knowing {\em  what} \co{precisely} separates this thing from others but usually it sufficesto know {\em where} the boundary between this thing and its surroundinggoes.\noo{An understanding, a \thi{rational} statement or attitude is one which  is not \thi{carried away}, which knows the limits of its validity or, at  least, knows that such limits exist.}  The difference is the same as betweenthe assumed positive contents and the negative limits of \co{distinctions}discussed in section \ref{sub:substances}, in particular,\refp{pa:pragmaticPositive}.  To understand something, one has to start withthis \thi{something} which is already given, \co{recognised}. (As Scholasticswould say, an \citet{act of judgment in reference to a \la{complexum}  [proposition] presupposes an act of apprehending the same  proposition.}{OckOrd}{Prologue, q.1 \kilde{p.19}}) The initial moment ofunderstanding is a \co{reflection} which isolates this \thi{something} as an\co{actual object}.  Often, we may at first not even know what it is that we aretrying to understand -- something happened, but for the moment it remains a mere\thi{something}, because we do not know what it was, whence it came nor what itmeant.  Only an \co{original sign} has appeared, which, in spite of, or ratherprecisely {\em through} its \co{vagueness}, calls for a closer attention.  Then,and only then, the questions like ``What is this thing?'', ``What makes it whatit is?'' can be asked. They ask for an explication of the involved \co{cut}, ofthe boundaries separating something already \co{recognised} from the \co{rest}.The answer involves further \co{reflection}, which now attempts to isolate theseboundaries from the totality of the \co{complex}.  Thus explication\co{dissociates} further, it \co{dissociates} the boundaries from the\co{complex} they bind, \thi{essence} from \thi{substance}, in search for theeventual definition, the rigid limit of the involved \co{distinctions}.\pa\label{pa:understand-context} But explication has no \thi{given} limit.Although in a given context, say of making a table, it may be natural not to askquestions about the atomic structure of the wood, or about consequences of theact for the world peace or future generations, such or similar questions arealways possible and may bring in \co{distinctions} which were not at allinvolved in the original situation. Every  \co{distinction} and limit thereofwhich has not been drawn to the ideal limit of a point can be refined whichoften means: considered in another context.%Trying to understand the \co{concept} of a group, I do start with itsdefinition, but the process involves necessarily relating it to other concepts,seeing what happens if I drop some axioms, if I add some, analysing possibleexamples and non-examples, relating it to a monoid, perhaps to a ring, etc.\noo{ This is different from eidetic variation because, as a matter of fact, I  am not looking for any \thi{essence}, any residuum of the thing. I have the  thing given for me -- it is this \thi{something} I started with! In the  present example, I have the definition and to understand it I have to figure  out when it can be applied and how it differs from other definitions, that is,  where its limits go.  } Understanding is relative to the context in which thething is considered and this context influences the boundaries of the thing. Ifthe only other concept I have is that of a monoid, my understanding of group maybe very poor. (Yet, it will be understanding! A group is distinguished from amonoid.) If I am able to relate the group to a large variety of other concepts,the understanding will be respectively deeper -- group will be distinguishedfrom more things/concepts with which it otherwise might be confused.In principle, one should also take into account something which happens entirelyimplicitly, namely, that some contexts are completely irrelevant. One won't tryto relate the mathematical groups to cows, last weekend's trip, one's mother.Although implicit, this is equally essential aspect of understanding since it,too, tells something about the limits of the thing. A great challenge ofteaching, for example, consists in being able to explicitly delimit the objectunder consideration against the horizon of completely (or only partly) unrelatedissues which, however, intrude typically on the apprehension of the object. Poorunderstanding will often violate exactly such implicit limits which for a moreadvanced understanding are simply not worth mentioning. Many jokes work simplyby violating the assumptions of such implicit contexts and dissolving the stiffform of habit and rule in the flow of the possible, even if unexpected,associations. (Inflexibility of character, whether personal or national, whichfeels threatened as soon as some rule is violated, is the same as the lack ofwit and humor.) Laughter brings such implicitly and often dogmatically assumedelements to the front and in this consists its often powerful and destructivefunction -- it abolishes the \thi{positive} and determinate character of the\thi{given}. For, as we observed, the function of \thi{positive} determinationsassigned to various limits of \co{distinctions} is exactly to exclude thepossible which is irrelevant and disturbing.  But this working of laughter isnegative and threatening only to stiffened and \thi{frozen} forms, to dogmaticprejudices, for which it is a painful reminder of their relativity, of the\co{experienced} flow from which they had emerged.\pa Rigidity of some limits of \co{distinctions} is only ideal and, at best,secondary.  Do you understand what a \thi{wave} is?  Whenever at the seashore,you can \co{recognise} waves or else see that there are none.  You know\thi{what makes a wave}.  But, do you?  What is it?  How high must it be inorder to be a \thi{wave}?  And where does one \thi{wave} end and another begins?It is impossible to say because there are no definite, rigid limits.  There areonly \co{vague cuts} which tell \wo{this is a wave and this is another}.  Youmay be unable to tell exactly where one wave ends and another begins, but stillyou are perfectly able to select some area, perhaps, around the peak, and saythat this marks a wave. We do not have an {\em explicit} understanding of a\thi{wave} because we are unable to isolate \co{reflectively} its limits.  Butwe know that it is not a whirlpool, nor a current, nor a building.  We are ableto delimit it against other things and these \co{distinctions}, whetherverbalized or not, make the \thi{wave} \co{concept} sufficientlyfamiliar.\ftnt{Leibniz would say that we have a \co{clear} but \thi{confused}  understanding of a \thi{wave}.\label{ftnt:clear}    {A clarification may be in place since the words will occur quite often.    \co{Clear} is not opposite of \co{vague} but of \co{precise}.  \co{Clear}    can be conjoined with \co{vague} in the way entirely analogical to that in    which Leibniz associates \co{clear} and \thi{confused} knowledge.%There are, of course, levels of \co{clarity} and Leibniz' example is quite%appropriate.\citef{When I recognise one thing among others withoutbeing able to say what its differences or properties consist in, myknowledge is \thi{confused}.  In this way we sometimes know\thi{clearly}, without being in any doubt, whether a poem or apainting is good or bad, because there is a certain \fre{je ne saisquoi} which pleases or offends us.}{LeibnizDM}{24.} %The insistence of this \noo{Corneillean}  \fre{je ne sais quoi} hasbeen obviously destined to eternal recurrence.%\citef{It is possible to \thi{understand} something, deeply, intimately, without \thi{grasping} it rationally, for instance, music.}{Heilige}{ XVIII}% I am not here after the distinction between aesthetic feelings and rational% understanding, though it might probably provide a simple example.\wo{\co{Vague}} corresponds to Leibniz' \wo{confused}, that is, \wo{indistinct}.The phrase \la{je ne sais quoi} (\thi{I do not know what}, \thi{a certain  something}) expresses quite accurately the \co{rest}, the impossibility ofgrasping this \thi{certain something} within the \hoa.  \co{Precision} amountsto excluding, cutting off (\la{praescindere}) all that threatens with slippingout of \co{immediate} control. This exclusion is what is \co{precise} about, forinstance, a \co{concept}.  It can be taken as an opposite of \co{clarity} -- itincreases with the narrowing of attention towards the limit of \co{immediate  actuality}, which diminishes the latter.  Leibniz also associates\thi{confused} with the large number of aspects which, so to speak, make itimpossible to comprehend them distinctly in one act.  \citef{Our confused  feelings are the result of a variety of perceptions which is indeed infinite  -- very like the confused murmur a person hears when approaching the  sea-shore, which comes from the putting together of the reverberations of  innumerable waves.}{LeibnizDM}{33} He does not use the word \wo{clear} here whichmight strike one as inappropriate, but this is exactly the word we might use.Thus, although not synonymous, \wo{\co{clear}} is close to co-extensional withLeibniz' \wo{confused} or our \wo{\co{vague}}.}}%\thi{Wave} is a much more fundamental example than a \thi{group} or a\thi{chair}, and understanding the former illustrates much better the process ofunderstanding which always originates in what some call \wo{tacit knowledge} andwhich we call \wo{\co{recognitions} of \co{experience}}.  An \co{object} is alimit of \co{distinctions}, of \co{cuts} from the background of \co{experience}and thus \co{an experience} of something involves obviously its tacitunderstanding.  Explication of this understanding is but a further\co{reflection} which tries to isolate the limits of a thing.  Sometimes, suchan isolation may be carried very far and sometimes it can not.\noo{The supposed \thi{essences} usually try to reduce a thing to such \thi{internal} characteristics, try to capture the thing -- a \thi{substance} -- in its supposed independence from the rest. Understanding the working of a car involves, indeed, the same kind of relations and delineations of various involved processes against alternative ones which would not make it work. But if we reduce a car to its working principles, then we have not really got very far, for how are these principles different from what makes a motorcycle, a triped, a bus work? If we relate explanation to thinking in terms of internal,\thi{essential} characteristics of separate objects, then we could saythat explanation is not only distinct from understanding but is alwaysconditioned by the latter -- to analyze the \thi{inside} of a thing, Ihave to first \co{distinguish} this thing.  Explanation is a reductionto the internal \co{distinctions} considered as constitutive,\thi{essential} for the object of interest.  And this distinctionbetween explanation and understanding would not apply merely tonatural sciences as opposed to humanistic ones but would go acrossmost, if not all, particular sciences.}%\subsubnonr{give up essences}%and no eventual limits...\paOne might perhaps say that the \thi{essence} of a thing is the totality of what \co{distinguishes} it from other things. Perhaps to grasp the supposed \thi{essence} is the same asto know the thing's limits.Perhaps, though then we have changed a bit the traditional sense of the word\wo{essence}. In particular, we must admit that no such final \thi{essences} obtain since, as said in \refp{pa:understand-context}, what distinguishes a thing from others depends on what others we take into account. And the field of references is inexhaustible.If one had managed to display at least one convincing \thi{essence}, one might,perhaps, also manage to arrive at some acceptable concept of a concept. No suchthing seems to be available but, fortunately, cognitive scientists took over thequarrels. Since terminating the \co{distinctions} at {\em some} limit isunavoidable, somebody will always think worthwhile to ask what the \thi{essence}of, say, a chair, might be. Typically it has four legs, but it may have onlyone, or none but rockers instead. One may try to define it functionally, as``something to sit on'', but then anything I can sit on becomes a chair, forinstance a table. One need not deny sincere ingenuity of many attempts tospecify the most purposeful way of defining things. But one should not confusethe normative, whether forensic or only administrative, character of suchendeavors with any ontological foundation, not to mention existential relevance.%(It seems that they fell from favour with cognitive scientists, too.) \citet{The time has arrived to give up the myths of induction and  \ger{Wesenschau}, which are carried over, as some point of honour, from  generation to generation. For it is clear that even Husserl himself never  gained \ger{Wesenschau} so that he would not have to re-consider and re-work  it again, not to disqualify it but to force it to express something that it  originally did not express at all [\ldots]}{VisInvis}{ Inquiry and intuition;p.122} The fact, which should have been disturbing, that nobody ever managedto demonstrate unchangeable \thi{essence} of anything, except, perhaps, fornormative definitions, in particular in mathematics, reflects the secondarycharacter of \co{concepts} as compared to the \oss\ and, above all, the merelyauxiliary character of positive, \thi{essential} determinations.  It reflectsalso the accidental character of most \co{totalities} -- no \co{complex} is morefundamental than others and there is no necessity for a \co{complex} to be sorather than otherwise -- primordially, it is but a \co{cut} from\co{experience}. The boundaries between things are, more often than not,\co{vague} enough to defy \co{precise} definition but also \co{clear} enough toadmit understanding.\pa But, one might worry, have we not gone a bit too far?  Does not a group, inits strict mathematical sense, have a well defined essence?  Well, this kind ofmathematical analogies have rather bad history in philosophy, so one better becareful with them.  But OK, it is a well defined \co{concept} with unambiguousdefinition.  What does it show?  That if we start with \co{concepts}, some\thi{primitive} and precisely given ones (here, of a binary operation,associativity, inverse, etc.), we can arrive at new ones.  This can certainly extend far beyond mathematics.  Have you never met an intellectual whois not able to relate to the world otherwise than through the \co{concepts} anddefinitions he has acquired?  His knowledge may be impressive but still thisomniscience is as pitiable as his apparent omnipotence.  The power ofconceptualisation, like of \co{reflection} in general, concerns only the\co{actuality} of \co{signs}. Its domain is exclusively the incessant\co{reflection} over things modeled as \co{objects}, as independent\thi{substances} -- reduced to their \thi{intelligible essences}.  \citet{Since  I have never been able to understand what the \thi{essence} of a concept is, I  must be excused from discussing this point any longer.}{Fruth}{II:18} But thisdoes nothing to the \co{concepts} themselves, because we still can give partial, more orless adequate, descriptions of \co{experienced} things, classes of things, kindsof things -- the \co{cuts} in the \co{experience} are there as they have beenall the time, and so are the \co{signs} with their power to bring such \co{cuts}into the \hoa.\subsubi{Concepts vs. impressions}\wtsep{understand -- limit}\pa Understanding a \co{concept} is, psychologically, very different frombeing in a \co{mood}, or having an \co{impression}.  But it is only apsychological difference. \co{Moods}, \co{concepts}, \co{impressions} -- all aremodes of understanding, for to understand something is to know its limits.  We hardly ever know these limits\co{precisely}, but that granted, understanding \thi{Prague} is to know, more orless, where it ends and ceases to be Prague, or else, what makes Praguedifferent from Paris, just like feeling {irritation} is not to feel tranquility orpleasure. More abstractly, it is to know, more or less, where \thi{irritation} ceases (or begins) to be one. Likewise, to understand the mathematical conceptof a group is to be able to recognise what is a group and what is not, isto be able to distinguish it from a monoid and from a field. In either case, itis \co{experience}, the texture of the wider context of \co{distinctions} which determines the adequacy, determinacy and, above all,understanding of the \co{concept} or, generally, of the \co{sign}. I understand the \co{sign} $X$ when I know what  it refers to, yes, but what it refers to is not (primarily) any positive\thi{essence} but simply the limits of its application.  It is not a questionabout properties of any subjects and accidents of any substances but, simply,about what distinguishes the \co{complex} $X$ from others, where $X$ begins (andceases) to be itself. \wtsep{unity -- multiplicity}As we observed in I:\refpf{pas:signsMean}, \co{signs} denote \co{distinctions}and not only \co{objective} entities in the physical world.  \co{Moods} and\co{impressions} introduce limits of \co{distinctions} within the \hoa, the\co{complexes} they address have the same scope, in fact, viewed as\co{externalised} contents, may be the same things as those addressed by\co{concepts} and \co{thoughts}.  The difference concerns the character of these\co{signs} -- \co{concepts} point towards the structural multiplicity and\co{moods} towards the unity of the \co{complexes}. \co{Concepts} dissolve the\co{non-actual} aspects into a multiplicity of \co{actual} determinations,\co{impressions} gather the \co{totality} of a \co{complex} into a one, unified\co{sign} which cannot be dissolved into components without changing the\co{impression}.  This difference, often viewed as a tension between the twokinds of \co{signs}, is merely a difference of emphasis and does not affect thefact that both have essentially the same function of signifying \co{complexes}.\wtsep{subjective -- objective}\pa\label{pa:moodCommunicate}\co{Moods} seem \thi{subjective}, only privately mine, while \co{concepts} areclaimed to be \thi{objective} or, at least, public and shared. As most claimswithin this dualism, this one means close to nothing and sounds as plausible, asit is misleading.The \co{reflectively dissociated} elements, the minute distinctions which can bepointed to and even captured by \co{actual} definitions are most easilycommunicable. And \co{concepts} are built upon such \co{distinctions}; they aredesigned not to be public or communicable, but to be {\em easily} communicable.\thi{Subjective} \co{impressions}, on the other hand, capture the unity of asituation in a way which is solidly anchored in the background of the personexperiencing it -- they \co{reflect} the situation as much as the person.  (Aperson with an obsessive fear of revealing his privacy might experience ourdetective as a persecutor, while one with a purely social interests as abothering snob.)  But they are not therefore private and incommunicable.  (Afterall, we {\em all} got the \co{impression} of a detective.)  They announce the(limits of) \co{distinctions} made in the \co{experience}, and this eventuallymeans, in the \co{one}.  As such they are accessible, at least in principle, toeverybody.\ftnt{\citef{Human emotions are to a large extent socially    objectified, and not subjective. Only a part of emotional life is subjective    and individual. Human thinking can be very subjective and often is so;    thinking can be more individual than emotions, it depends less on the    social objectification [...] Currently, one admits more and more often that    there exist emotional apprehension [\ger{Erkenntnis}]. It was claimed by    Pascal, Scheler, and was emphasized by Keyserling.}{Bier}{I:1\kilde{p.13}}}With respect to feelings and \co{moods}, one speaks perhaps about \thi{empathy}or \thi{sympathy}. Although many people have limited capacities in this respect,this may be because feeling {\em exactly the same} as another person, is arather futile attempt to overcome one's sense of \co{alienated} subjectivism.But if one is unable to \co{recognise} what another person is feeling, and oneis unable to do so {\em in principle}, then one should have one's psychology andemotional constitution looked at.  All people have, at least in principle, thecapacity to face the same situation, to address the same (limits of)\co{distinctions}. What matters is that one relates to (roughly) the same\co{totality} of a situation, which involves also the reactions and feelings ofother persons, and \co{sharing} another's feelings is, at bottom, no differentfrom \co{sharing} his situation and problems. Whether one does it using one'semotional intelligence rather than distanced reflection is of no significance aslong as the results are (roughly) of the same character. It is only by reducingfeelings and \co{moods} to their affective \co{aspect}, to the mere fact of\thi{affecting me here and now} and, on the other hand, imagining \co{concepts}as some eternal \thi{essences}, that distribution of the \co{dissociated} labels\thi{subjective}, respectively, \thi{objective} may have some appeal. Butstatements like \wo{It is sunny} or \wo{Two plus two is four} communicateexactly as much as \wo{I am feeling depressed} or \wo{I had a bad day}. Theycommunicate the meaning which, when understood, is \co{shared} by theparticipants of the communication. In fact, the communicated statements areunderstood only because something is already \co{shared}, and the actualutterances only \co{actualise} something of the \co{shared} horizon. Themeaning, of course, is different in each (pair) of the cases, but this does notimpair the possibility of communicating and \co{sharing} the \co{moods} just asone can {share} the \co{objective} contents of observation statements.\ftnt{We  will say more about \co{sharing} in  III:\ref{sub:examples}.\refpf{pa:communion}; here we only wanted to signal the  fact that assumed \thi{subjectivity} of feelings and \co{moods}, relating  eventually, as everything else, to the \co{indistinct} \co{one}, is not so  totally \thi{subjective} after all.}Having different feelings in a given situation is just like having differentunderstanding of this situation. Incapacity of some persons to \co{share} thefeelings of others witnesses to the \thi{subjectivity} of feelings as much asthe incapacity of some persons to understand the \co{concepts} understood byothers witnesses to the \thi{subjectivity} of \co{concepts}.  There is also thisfinal characteristic of understanding in general, and \co{conceptual}understanding in particular: it amounts to knowing the limits. As we said, notin the sense of knowing \co{precisely} where the border between $X$ and $Y$ goes(which is an illusory ideal), but only in the sense of \co{recognising} $X$ asthe focal point, the center excluding everything which is not $X$. The\co{distinction} of $X$, drawing its limits, is not voluntarily determined byone's wish or arbitrary caprice. Yet, it is relative to the \co{existence}drawing this limit and here lies the \co{aspect} of freedom, or in any case ofsome indeterminacy. Where to draw the limit? Does Earth really, in fact, move ornot? Of course, we know that it does, yet living on Earth we will never stopseeing the sun {\em rising} above the resting horizon and {\em moving} acrossthe sky over the immovable surface of our planet.  \co{Concepts} change overtime; a \co{concept} as if evolves, centering perhaps all the time around thesame basic intuition, by changing its place in relation to other \co{concepts}and even the borders separating it from others. There is a discernible linewhich goes from the basic idea of weight of daily objects, through the factthat air too has some weight, through the Newtonian mass, to the relativisticmass. Yet the actual \co{concepts} are in all cases different, even if\co{vaguely} related. One might ask if we then deal with the same \co{concept}or different ones, but we leave quibbling to the quibblers. For the most,\co{concepts} do not have any unique and \co{precise} boundaries and where suchboundaries are set may depend on the historical situation, on the social contextand even on the individual user.  \noo{Having dispensed with \thi{substances} as  any \thi{things in themselves}, we should not have much trouble with  recognising that neither \co{concepts} are any metaphysically rigid measures  \thi{in themselves}.  } In this respect, if \co{concepts} differ fromfeelings, it is because they change during the history to the degree which itwould be hard to discern in the emotional and spiritual complexion of thehumans.\ftnt{We can refer to \citeauthor*{EvolConcept} for a general theory of  concepts as evolutionary entities. Yet one may feel that this is stretching  the point too far. At least the mathematical concepts do not depend so on  extra-mathematical circumstances. In a sense, we agree, and we will return to  this sense in the last section of this Book. Consider, however, \citef{[t]he    concept \thi{trisection of an angle with ruler and compass}, when people are    trying to do it, and, on the other hand, when it has been proved that there    is no such thing.}{WittPI}{ I:334} The fact that, say, the concept of a  group has become what it is (a non-empty set $X$, closed under a total binary  function $\_\cdot\_$, which is associative, $\forall x,y,z\in X:x\cdot (y\cdot  z)=(x\cdot y)\cdot z$, has an identity element $1$ such that $\forall x:1\cdot  x=x\cdot 1=x$, and inverse $\_^-$ such that $\forall x\in X:x\cdot  x^-=x^-\cdot x=1$) was a matter of development. Just a few examples from a  long list of variations attempted in the history.  Ruffini considered (around  1799) only groups of permutations and used explicitly only the property of  closure (the other properties hold for permutations \thi{automatically});  Galois used (in 1831-32) the group properties extensively without ever  defining the concept; Cayley introduced (in 1854) a collection of operators  (on another set) which were closed under associative composition, had an  identity and inverse. Intuitions point unmistakably in the same direction but  did they all have the same concept, and if so, was it the same concept as we  have today? (Permutation groups are, after all, only a special case of the  general concept (even if the crucial one, since every finite group can be  represented as such a one). Cayley's requirements are almost the modern  axioms, but his definition applied to a collection of operators over some  other set.) If one feels tempted to answer yes, \noo{since the abstract    properties used by these three and many others were, in fact, the ones we    list today among the axioms } one should better consider that, for instance,  non-zero rationals with multiplication form a group so, perhaps, the concept  was known to the ancient Greeks\ldots? The mathematical adventure has led to  drawing just these, and not other, division lines (choosing just these, and  not other, axioms.) This terminus became abstracted and posited as a new  entity, a new object of possible study. {\em This entity} did not  \co{actually} exist earlier in the mathematical world, it \thi{was there} only  as a \co{virtual} possibility of being distinguished. And so \thi{were there}  all the variations which ended up as special cases or failed approximations,  as well as all those which still \thi{are there}.\label{ftnt:group}}\newp %\ \vspace*{-2ex}\noo{Degrees % (and individuals!)  \pa \co{Concepts}, like \co{impressions} and almost everything else, admit  degrees.

This, we might say, happens when  such a unifying \co{sign} emerges, either as the word \wo{bird} or, perhaps, a  mere recurring \thi{\ldots}, where \thi{\ldots} is whatever the perceptive  system uses to identify birds or whatever word, in the entirely {\em private}  language, the child might use.  }\wtsep{Gestalt vs. abstraction}\pa\label{pa:lab} Emphasizing the importance of the \oss, we were not trying torepeat the analyses of Gestalt psychology of perception which, althoughcertainly applicable in many cases, are not universal. Neither were we trying topostulate that every \co{impression} is accompanied by the actual thought of its\co{complex}. The two represent only different modes of presentation but, although addressing the same\co{complexes}, need not go in any pairs. In particular, a \co{complex} may alsoenter the \hoa\ after its aspects have been seen, analysed, contemplated --experienced. In the epistemological tradition underlied by the image of ultimate\thi{atoms}, this has in fact been the only possibility: abstraction (ofhigher concepts from instances), induction (of general laws from special cases), deduction (of consequences from given axioms), construction (of complexstructures from simple atoms) are all variations on this theme, and we will notadd any more for rather obvious reasons. But the same possibility of a unifying\co{sign} arising after various aspects of the corresponding \co{complex}applies also in the case of \co{impressions}. Entering a room, one need not get immediately any general \co{impression}. Onecan have none and get one first after being in this room for a while, afterhaving discovered different aspects and objects collected there which, together,build up a unified \co{impression} of the whole.  Looking for a way in a foreigncity, one can be forced to stop at each cross and ask for directions, to consultthe city's plan, etc. Eventually, one finds the way.  The next day one may stillhave difficulties but the intermissions won't be that frequent. After a fewtimes one knows the way \thi{by heart}, one has it as a one entity, given in asingle moment not with all its details but with the clarity of the single\co{sign}: \wo{I know the way.} One has \thi{built a totality}. Sure, to beginwith one might have had a mere idea of this way from the hotel to the restaurantbut now one has \co{an experience} of it. Shall we call it a \wo{concept} ofthis way? An \wo{impression}? An \wo{understanding}?  We leave quarrels aboutthat to those who find them worthwhile.A good example of a \co{concept} emerging after the experiences of its partsinvolves reasoning, for instance, understanding a mathematical definition.  Tobegin with, one has to work one's way through the notation, then through the otherconcepts applied, then their interrelations, finally, its implications andrelations to other definitions.  Then one may understand it but it is not the sameas \thi{getting it}.  To \thi{get it}, one has to grasp the whole in one \co{act}-- of intuition, inner perception, call it as you like -- which gives perhapsa wrong \co{impression} of certainty that, even if one does not know all possibleimplications and applications of the definition, one knows {\em how} it possiblycan be used, that is, where it can not be used.  \thi{Getting it} is an\co{impression} of several things falling on their place, of having understood,which accompanies acquisition of a \co{concept}. It is not, of course, the\co{impression} corresponding to (the same \co{complex} as) the \co{concept}itself. The latter may be a more subtle matter. Developing understanding of somefield, one develops also~\ldots intuition. And that not only in the vague andgeneral but also in the quite technical sense of that mode which \citet{relates  immediately to the object, and is single. [...]  In whatsoever mode, or by  whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to objects, it is at least quite  clear that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them is by means  of an intuition.}{CrPR}{A320/B377-A19/B33\kilde{Doct of Elements} [Without,  of course, agreeing to the Kantian limitation of intuition to sensuous  perception.]} This kind of intuition comes very close to what we mean by an\co{impression}, a unified \co{sign} of a \co{complex}. And it arises when\wo{[a]t the end of a certain time ordinary meditation produces what is called  acquired contemplation, which consists in seeing at a simple glance the truths  which could previously be discovered only through prolonged  discourse.}\ftnt{Although the passage refers to the development of spiritual  insight, it is obviously applicable. The quotation is from  \citeauthor*{Alphonsus}{ Appendix I:7}.}  All \co{reflective} efforts areguided by the search for such a unifying intuition -- but \wo{for the intellect,  the unity remains only a postulate, an act of  faith.}\ftnt{I:footnote~\ref{ft:rada}.}\wtsep{precise -- vague}\pa\co{Concepts}, being events of \co{reflective experience}, and even of \co{attentive reflection}, like to have a \co{precise} foundation, a basis of some primitives from which more complicated \co{concepts} could be built.\noo{This seems to be one of a few characteristics shared by all theorising about concepts.}Concepts are built bottom-up, either by construction or by abstraction, frominitial \thi{givens}, like \thi{substances} or rather their conceptualcounterparts, \thi{essences}.% Let us observe a certain similarity of \co{distinction} and abstraction -- the% latter, as understood in Aristotle's theory of forms, or later in Abelard's% theory of universals.For us, abstraction is a secondary function of \co{reflection} which, startingwith the \co{objective} limits of \co{distinctions}, extracts from them some\thi{features}, general \thi{properties} which, indeed, are observed only in the{objectified} particular things. As Abelard, repeating Aristotle, points out,\citt{The understanding considers separately by abstraction, but does not  consider as separated [...]}{P.Abelard, \btit{The Glosses on Porphyry}  \citaft{Jones}{V;p.194}} We would say: \co{distinctions} are not \co{dissociations}. One might perhaps quote Hegelsaying that a \co{distinction} is an abstraction from the \co{indistinct}, but this would onlyconfuse the language. The difference is that \co{distinctions} are primary andabstraction secondary: abstraction must start from somewhere, and it believes tostart from some basic, \thi{atomic givens}.  Only the primordial\co{distinctions}, and the \co{reflective dissociations} in particular, providethis very ground from which abstraction may possibly start. Any \co{distinctions} can be refined, and so no eventual substances are to befound. As \co{concepts} mean only what they refer to, so even trying toestablish \thi{positive essences}, no such things as primitive, basic\co{concepts} are to be expected.  \co{Distinctions} may introduce apparentuniversals before one has accumulated enough \thi{substantialised} instances toperform any abstraction. As phenomenologists say, induction is not necessary andoften it is sufficient to encounter one single instance of a phenomenon, toperceive its essential (universal) aspects. Yet this apparent universal, likeeverything else, may be eventually confronted with further differentiation. Aperson may acquire the concept \thi{BC} without understanding what \thi{B} and\thi{C} are. For the sake of example, let us take \thi{B} to be \thi{brown} and\thi{C} to be \thi{cat}.  A child growing up with only \thi{BC}s, but with noseparate \thi{B}s or \thi{C}s, might learn to distinguish \thi{BC}s from\thi{ZY}s, even have a word \wo{bc}, without ever getting the idea ofdissociating \thi{B} from \thi{C}.\noo{This reminds strongly about James'  \thi{conjunctive relations}.} But meeting \thi{BD} (brown dogs?), can giverise to separate concepts -- \co{dissociation} -- of \thi{B} and \thi{C}.  Aslong as \thi{B} and \thi{C} appear only in \thi{BC} they may be, to some degree,\co{recognised} but they are not (necessarily) \co{dissociated}.  What happenedwith \thi{BC}, can now happen to \thi{B} and \thi{C}, which remain\thi{primitive} only as long as further \co{distinctions} are not drawn.We are not saying that, in practice, one must not built conceptual constructionsfrom some basis of determined primitives. This is the only way to raise anyconceptual constructions.  But such constructions proceed only upwards fromearlier \co{dissociated} pieces and hence will never reach any bottom which theymust, in fact, always presuppose. To put it trivially, \co{reflection} can nevercapture \co{experience}.\noo{One is free to call it \wo{scepticism} but we would  object. For the first, we aren't even half-way through, yet. And for the  second, identifying knowledge, understanding, or epistemology, with the  adventures of \co{reflection} is a bad habit.}  There are no metaphysicallyultimate \thi{atoms} from which \co{reflection} could once and for allreconstruct the whole world as it is \thi{in itself}. But also, every\co{reflective} project must needs start from some basis, from some\thi{givens}. These two facts not only are not contradictory but do not implyany scepticism either. It is exactly the tension between them which harbours allthe \co{concreteness} of which \co{reflection} is capable.\ad{Universals}%We were trying to point out the analogies, rather than the differences, between\co{moods} and \co{concepts}: they have the same temporal scope; addressing\co{complexes}, they move in the tension between the unity of a \co{sign} andthe multiplicity of the aspects and properties of the \co{complex}; we haveemphasized the communicability of \co{moods}, if not an irresolvable associationso at least complementarity of \co{concepts} and \co{moods}, and the fact thatnot only \co{impressions}, but also \co{concepts} come in various degrees of\co{precision}. Eventually, the difference between the two turns out to be thedifference of tendency and degree: \co{concepts} \co{dissociate} striving formathematical \co{precision}, while \co{moods} keep the \co{complexes} in a\co{vague} -- but \co{clear} -- unity.This, however, is hardly the whole difference!  Isn't it so that \co{concepts}are (composed of) universals \citet{and by the universal we mean that which is  predicable of the individuals,}{AristMeta}{III:4} that which \citetib{is  common, since that is called universal which is such as to belong to more than  one thing.}{AristMeta}{VII:13} Moreover, it is that which can be {\em known}about particular, it is \citet{implicit in the clearly known  particular.}{PostAnal}{I:1} \co{Impressions}, on the other hand, areparticular and unique, and certainly not known with the \co{precision} withwhich universals constituting essences can be known.This isn't exactly so. This opposition reflects indubitable psychologicaldifference but also (perhaps by the same token) the source of ambiguitiesinherent in Aristotelian and post-Aristotelian metaphysics: the division intoindividuals and non-individuals which is supposed to apply \thi{objectively} notonly to living beings but also to material \co{distinctions}, things and theirproperties. The \co{dissociation} into atomic, \thi{substantial} entities,existing each completely on its own, makes any connection between them at bestsecondary, and at worst unreal. These two positions with respect to universals-- considering them either as secondary or as completely unreal --seem the only possible once we assume the ontology of particular \thi{substances}.\pa First, concerning the opposition to feelings and \co{moods}, there is whatwe just said in \refp{pa:moodCommunicate} about the possibility of \co{sharing}them.  Then, one can have a \co{concept} of some \co{impression}, say a\co{concept} of irritation. Probably, it will be only the \co{sign}, the wordwhich comes to one's mind whenever experiencing irritation, but it may be more.But even if one does not have such a \co{concept}, one can still experience thesame irritation on different occasions, one can \co{recognise} the feeling oneis having now as the same one had before. Yeah, this looks like a kind of\thi{private language}.  The word \wo{language} here is bad, but \wo{private}and \wo{\co{recognisable}} are definitely on the proper place.  The worryingphrase is, of course, \wo{the same}, but then remember that we are not talkingabout any \thi{essences} reappearing in new instantiations at completelydissociated points of time. We are talking about \co{cuts} from the continuityof \co{experience}, eventually, from the \co{indistinct}. A \thi{new instance}of irritation does not appear from nothing to get re-cognised and connected tosome old and merely remembered instance. It enters the \hoa\ through the levelsof gradual \co{actualisation} from some \nexus\ which constitutes its\thi{relatedness} to a whole field of other \co{experiences}.  This \nexus\ involves also more \co{virtual traces} and various \co{actual experiences} emerge as\thi{instances} of the same because they arise from the same \nexus\ and passthrough the same \co{traces} on their way toward \co{actualisation}.\thi{Identity} of one \thi{instance} of irritation and another is constituted{\em before} they get \co{actually} \thi{instantiated}.  This is all we cananswer to the question \wo{{\em How} can I be certain that it is the same  irritation as before?} -- the two are indistinguishable in their \co{virtual}source and the only difference concerns the two \co{actual} manifestations,appearance at two different moments. One should not confuse an \co{impression}with an \co{actual} \thi{instance} of the \co{impression}, the whole \co{trace}on which the \nexus\ of some \co{impression} resides with a particular situationwhere the \co{impression} is experienced. Only the assumed ontologyof \co{dissociated objects} and epistemology of discrete time of unitary\co{reflective acts} make one worry about the \thi{unreality} of identity and,in fact, of any relation, between \co{experiences} whose only observabledifference consist in their appearance at different points of time.True, conceptual universals can be arrived at by abstraction, which means, theirrelation to the particulars they subsume will be much more \co{precise} and\co{visible}. But to the extent they are not mere \co{reflective} constructions,they will also \co{reflect} some \co{distinctions} which \co{cut}the \co{experience} beyond any possible \co{actuality}.\newpa \paEverything that is is a \co{distinction} or a limit thereof, a \co{cut} from\co{experience}.  And every \co{cut} is unique: what it\co{cuts} out is not \co{cut} out by any other \co{cut}.  A \co{cut} isjust that which it \co{cuts}.  Certainly, \citet{it is impossible toabstract universals from the singular without previous knowledge ofthe singular}{ScotAnima}{22:3 [This does go for many \co{concepts} formed by \co{reflection} in the process of abstraction -- but this does not make it the fundamental characteristic of universals.]}but it is only the traditional reduction of\thi{reality} to \co{actuality} which forces one to assume that universals arise only by abstraction, that to encounter \thi{chair} one has to first seeseveral chairs. %\begin{itemize}\MyLPar\ans Concepts are abstract and universal. Universal, that is, they may have many particular instances, be encountered in different experiences.\que Recalling \refp{th:noindividual}, at this moment, I wouldn't be so comfortable with the word \wo{particular} but let go. Is \thi{Prague} a universal?When I go around, I see this building and that corner, from the Old Town Square I do not see \ger{Vy\v{s}ehrad} and from below of \ger{Vy\v{s}ehrad} I do not see \ger{Hrad\v{c}any}.\ans Yes, but still it is a particular thing, only ``too big'' to be seen all at once.\que It is too big and at each of these places I see a part of \thi{Prague}, I have a different \co{actual experience} of Prague, something which, with enough of bad will, can be called ``a particular instance'' of \thi{Prague}.\ans No, you see different parts of a big city, you do not see {\em the same} universal exemplified in various particular places.\que OK, what I see of the \thi{horse} in this  horse is exactly the same as what I see of it in another horse. But what I see of \thi{this chair} now is {\em the same} as what I saw of it yesterday. And do not tell me that it does not count because \thi{this chair} is a particular.\ans It counts because  you may have several distinct exemplifications of the same universal {\em simultaneously} and, furthermore, you may {\em always encounter more}. With this chair you cannot do the former -- nor the latter if I burn it.\que What about \thi{all my grannie's chairs}? It seems, it looks more like a universal than like a particular. But they all are here -- she has never had more than these four. And, besides, she is dead, so you will never get new ones. If it is ``my grannie'' who annoys you here, then what about the dinosaurs? We have rather run out of the possible newinstances.\ans Forget new instances; a universal is universal even if no instances exist.\que Have you turned extreme realist in this matter? But tell me first what they are.\ansTake \wo{abstract} -- a universal is not an independent being, it is always only an aspect of a particular.\que You have just said that it need no particular instances\ldotsSo, after all, the \thi{chair} (or the \thi{dinosaur}) is not universal?\ans It is, but it is what is common to many chairs, what can be predicatedequally of many particulars.\que By \thi{common} you mean, probably, something like a stereotype, a paradigmatic instance, or just the \thi{essence} -- but we know that thesewon't quite do. But who are these particulars? And isn't \thi{Prague} the same at this particular \ger{Vy\v{s}ehrad} and at this particular \ger{Hrad\v{c}any}?\ans It is, but \thi{Prague} is not {\em predicated} about them.\que Really? One does predicate \wo{praski} about this particular\ger{Hrad}.\noo{and this particular \ger{Vy\v{s}ehrad}.}  But even if onedidn't.  So it would be just a matter of how we use the language? If I say``This city is exactly like Prague while that one is not.'' will it do?\ans Of course, not. First you use ``Prague'' as a name of a particular city; then you use it as a \ldots %\que Predicate? A concept? Then, does it mean that I can pick any particular (reference) and turn it into a (predicable) concept?\noo{Why  not? Just like any   predicate can be nominalised, i.e., turned into a referential concept, so any particular reference, like \thi{Prague}, can beturned into a referential concept (often, by means of a definite description)which can then be turned into a predicate, \thi{Prague-like}.}And what is the difference, except for the purely grammatical one, between ``Prague'' used in the first and in the second way?\ans Predicating \thi{Prague} of another city, you are really predicating someuniversal which is implicit in Prague and which you also find in this othercity.\que Perhaps, but then one should tell me what universal it is. As far as I amconcerned, Prague has a very specific character and atmosphere,indistinguishable from its uniqueness, which can hardly be characterised better than ``Prague-like'' and which can be in various forms or degrees foundat some other places.\item[] etc., etc., \ldots\end{itemize}%\pa Being brought on a visit, at the age of two, to Prague I did not acquire any\co{concept} \thi{Prague}. But I certainly \co{experienced} something. On latervisits I could gather all the variety of views and impressions of the city underthe common name \wo{Prague}.  Yes! \thi{Prague} is a \co{concept}; as good asany other -- it is a \co{sign} unifying a variety of experiences and, if oneinsists, \co{objective} facts, into a totality of one \co{complex}.\thi{Conceptually} it is, perhaps, a very poor \co{concept}, but it still can bepredicated about other elements of experience.  With such a generousunderstanding of a \co{concept}, we are not interested in possible distinctionsbetween various kinds of \co{concepts}.  Such \co{distinctions} will be butdistinctions concerning {\em what} I may have a \co{concept} {\em of}.Certainly there is a huge difference between the \co{concept} \thi{Prague},\thi{bird} \noo{my dog Philo} and \thi{prime number}.  But there is nothinginherently {\em conceptual} about these differences -- it is but the differenceof content, the difference between Prague, birds, prime numbers. \co{Concepts}are meanings, \co{distinctions} which can be \co{actualised} enough to begrasped and understood in the unity of one \co{act}.  Now, as to the universals:\thesisnonr{Universals are the \co{non-actual} things of\co{experience}, the \co{cuts} through the \co{experience}exceeding the \hoa.} As \co{non-actuals}, universals appear first of all as non-individuals.Characterising the individuals as whatever can be grasped within the \hoa, theiropposite becomes anything that \co{transcends} it. The relation between the\co{actual} and the \co{non-actual} is much more intimate than the bareopposition, but it reminds of a relativised (to the \co{existence}) version ofthe relation between particular substances and universals.  \citet{If they are  universal, they will not be substances; for everything that is common  indicates not a \thi{this} but a \thi{such}, but substance is a  \thi{this}.}{AristMeta}{III:6} Universals are possible stations of\co{distinctions} which, sedimented into \co{signs}, allow then further\co{distinctions} providing, as one says, \thi{particular instances}.  But theprimary difference, {\em the} difference which counts, is only that between thepossibility of an \co{experienced} completeness, of being given within the \hoa\ versus the \co{experience} of its factual (or even essential) \co{non-actuality}.With respect to the \hoa, the whole Prague, Europe, irritation, my life are asmuch outside of it as the assumed universals. All that can appear within this\co{horizon} are their respective \co{signs}.The problems with the status of universals are encountered with respect toindividuals as the problems of their identity or their \thi{substantiality}. Thequestion: what makes different occurrences of \thi{blue} or \thi{chair}instances {\em of the same} universal \thi{blue} or \thi{chair}, is not reallydifferent from the question: what accounts for the fact that the chair I see nowis {\em the same as} the one I left here yesterday (or what is one in theexperiences of Prague.)  Once we have drawn a limit of \co{distinctions} aroundPrague, it has become one city and we may have thousands of experiences, allbeing experiences of Prague, all exemplifying this particular city in the sameway as one chair exemplifies \thi{chair} or, perhaps, another chair.  The one isthe \co{sign}, the word ``Prague'', ``chair''.  But these are not mere emptywords, they refer back to the \co{cuts from experience} which, stretching farbeyond the narrow scope of any particular \herenow, terminate at some limitbeyond the \hoa.  The \thi{oneness} has no accurate verbal definition, nobodycan tell \co{precisely} where Prague begins and where it ends, what it {\em  really} is, etc.  Just like nobody can tell \co{precisely} what constitutes a\thi{wave} nor what the \co{concept} \thi{chair} is (when something I can sit onceases to be a chair, acquires rockers or, perhaps, becomes a {stump}).The impossibility of verbalizing such \thi{identities} does not witness to theimpossibility of attaining any knowledge of them but merely to the fact thatlinguistic, and then \co{conceptual}, \co{distinctions} do not exhaust the fieldof our knowing. One can distinguish a chair from a tree stump which should beenough to say that one knows the difference between the two, even if one can notspell it out \co{precisely} and unambiguously. The assumed \thi{essences} playthe crucial role in handling \co{concepts} and universals by reducing (or ratherattempting to reduce) the non-\co{actual}, and even \co{non-actual}, things topurely \co{actual} aspects, just like the \thi{substances} justify theobjectivistic illusion in its restriction to mere \co{actuality}, in populatingthe whole universe exclusively with individual beings which, moreover, tend todissolve as the vanishing points of ultimate self-identity.\noo{the most universal thingsare elements (because each of them being one and simple is presentin a plurality of things, either in all or in as many as possible),and that unity and the point are thought by some to be firstprinciples. Now, since the so-called genera are universal andindivisible (for there is no definition of them), some say thegenera are elements, and more so than the differentia, because thegenus is more universal; for where the differentia is present, thegenus accompanies it, but where the genus is present, thedifferentia is not always so. {V:3}}\pa The problems of the universals originate from the assumption that thereare some definite particulars -- some basic substances, independent, simple andindecomposable and, moreover, that such particulars are the only genuine objectsof experience; in short, from the reduction of \co{experience} to\co{actuality}. This assumption is inseparable from the less desirable one, namely, that experience consists of some isolated points, \thi{nows}, strangelyand always inexplicably succeeding each other.  But  \co{actual experiences} and things which can be experienced within the \hoa,which can be made \co{actual objects} of attention, are interwoven into thecontinuous texture of \co{experience}, are only its \co{actual reflections}.Encountering \thi{a new instance of a universal} may be a new \co{actual  experience}. But this is not \thi{added} to the rest of \co{experience}, as anew item to a collection -- \noo{It may be so \thi{added} only to the  \co{totality} of \co{experiences}, but this is just the way of thinking in  terms of \co{actuality} alone, which we are opposing.} it is rather subtracted, for it has emerged as \co{an actual experience} {\em from}\co{experience}.What do we encounter the first time we see a cup? \thi{This cup} or \thi{a cup}?I guess, {\em both} for there is no reason to draw any such distinction. Havingboth means that we have neither, neither particular nor universal, just\thi{cup} (or, perhaps, a special \thi{this}). Encountering the same cup for thesecond time, it is not added to the earlier \thi{cup} -- it is subtracted fromit (and, sure, it is also subtracted from all the \co{rest}, but it emerges fromthe horizon through the \co{trace} whose last point is this earlier \thi{cup}.)This subtraction establishes simultaneously {\em both} the universal \thi{cup}and its two particular instances.  As a matter of fact, we still have notencountered \thi{this cup} or else, there is still no distinction between (theuniversal) \thi{cup} and \thi{this cup}. (Such a distinction may arise when, forinstance, somebody brings in a new cup and puts it next to our \thi{cup}.)  Inthe same manner, \ger{praski Hrad} and \ger{Vy\v{s}ehrad} become\co{dissociated} from the same \co{trace} of Prague which, in turn, has beendetached from one's \co{experiences} of one's home-town and from the whole\co{experience}.The \co{reflective} thinking happens already within the assumed ontology of\co{dissociated} and \co{externalised objects}, and equally \co{dissociated}points, \thi{substantive parts} of time.  But when \co{my reflection} encounterssomething completely new and unexpected, when it \thi{adds} a new and some old instances, performing theabstraction of, say, \thi{Prague} or the common nature \thi{cup}, these havealready been \co{distinguished} as unities \co{before} and \co{above} this\co{reflective act}. The \co{reflectively} new and unexpected has emerged fromsome \co{trace} in the process which is performed in my \co{experience} (in mybody, my perceptual mechanism, my brain, or wherever one wants to look for it)and of which \co{reflection} only finds the final results.  Every new cup is notadded to but is \co{distinguished} from the same \co{trace} as, for one reasonor another, a new entity. To emerge as distinct, the two must have first beenthe same. When \co{I} notice a new cup and \thi{associate} it with an earlierone, this is only a conscious or subconscious \co{reflection} of the processwhich has already \co{dissociated} the two from the same origin.  Eventually,everything emerges from the \co{one} and the same \co{indistinct}, everything isone before it becomes two.  Of course, once such \co{dissociations} have beenestablished and sedimented, \thi{new instances} of Prague, cup etc. can beencountered, that is, universals can start appearing as common features.  But it is the \co{unity}of \co{experience} which \co{founds} the continuity in the \co{experience} ofthe particulars as well as of the connections between various instances ofuniversals, in short, of the very possibility of \co{reflective}\thi{association}. %, or getting back to our language, of the \co{non-actual} things.Universals, and more generally \co{non-actual} things, witness thus to this\co{unity} of \co{experience}, \co{founding} also the very experience ofparticulars. Trying to get rid of the former, one ends up dissolving the latteras well, because both happen not only to mutually condition each other but alsobecause both are underlied by the same principle of constitution: as thesedimented limits of \co{distinctions}; and particulars are but the \co{actual}limits of \co{traces} which \co{cut experience} far \co{above} the \hoa. %contra post-modernists% The differences concern only the degree of consciousness, accompanying such% experiences, that the \co{object} is actually a \co{complex}, that it is not% fully \co{actual}.The degree of similarity, or the character of what is common to many \co{actualexperiences}, distinguishing the non-\co{actuality} of \thi{Prague} from that of\thi{chair} and from that of \thi{this chair} is only a difference of degree.\co{Concepts} are the \co{actual signs} of (often \co{non-actual}) things whosecharacteristics, whose repeating aspects are more prone to \co{actualisation}:it is easier to indicate (but still only indicate) what possibly might beincluded in -- perhaps even exhaust! -- the \co{concept} \thi{chair} than the\co{concept} \thi{Prague}.  What connects one experience of Prague with anothermay be different from what connects one instance of \thi{chair} with another.But the fact that in the latter case this connection seems more organising andis based on \co{actually} identifiable similarities rather than some vaguelyintuited emotional characteristics, or mere geography, is merely a quantitative difference ofdegree. The basis is not a connection which \co{reflection} has toestablish between \co{dissociated actualities} but a \co{cut} through  \co{experience}, a \co{cut} made in the \co{experience above} the \hoa.\pa \co{Positing} particular, most \co{actual} entities as the primordial\thi{substances}, is based on the prior \co{reflective dissociation}.Abstracting activity of \co{concept} construction starts naturally from thosebasic entities which are most \co{precisely} grasped by the singular \co{acts}of \co{reflection}.  The conflict between nominalism and conceptualism (viewinguniversals as conceptual abstractions) is played already on the ground of theontology of particulars. The question concerns only to what extent particularscontain any reality beyond their particularity or \thi{substantiality}. As such,both these views are opposed to the earlier realism which was willing to assignthe universals independent reality. Our universals remind indeed closely of theindependent forms which can exist -- be \co{distinguished} -- also before anyparticular instances are identified. But we never try to \co{dissociate} thedifferent levels of \co{experience} -- in this sense, once the \hoa\ isestablished, no \co{non-actuality} can exist without and independently from it.A very limited space is left for conceptualism in that one can sometimes obtainnew universal characteristics by abstraction, but abstraction accounts neitherfor their primary form nor for their eventual ontological status. Nominalismmust rest satisfied with the fact that universals, just like all \co{experienced  distinctions}, are relative to the \co{distinguishing existence}.% Realism = platonic, unity before units% Nominalism = pure empiricism, only immediate% conceptualism = closer to nominalism, still ontology of particulars; \noo{ \pa Do we end in nominalism? Not at all. The reality of \co{concepts} is  much more than realism was able to assign to them.  The one is the \co{sign},  the word ``Prague'', ``chair''. But these are not mere empty words, they refer  back to \co{impressions}, \co{experience} and the \co{cuts from experience},  which stretch far beyond the narrow scope of any particular \herenow.    The status of a universal is the same as of a \co{sign} announcing presence of  a \co{complex} which itself never can be fully \co{actual}.  And the  ontological status, if we may misuse the phrase, of its denotation -- which is  the same as its connotation -- is the same as that of a \co{complex}: a series  of \co{experiences} (if we want to focus on \co{actual experiences}), each  bringing forth different or similar aspects of a totality. The point is that  this totality 1. has been \co{cut from the background} of the whole  \co{experience} as a \co{unity} which then 2. is gathered in the  \co{actuality} of one \co{sign}.  In short, it is an \co{experienced} thing, a  \co{cut from experience}, which differs from the particular things only in the  impossibility of squeezing it within the \hoa.    Entering the \hoa\ as a \co{sign}, each such thing can be, in turn, made into  an \co{object} and treated as if it were one. This is where the issue between  realism and nominalism arises.    It is also what is usually understood by conceptual analysis and abstraction  starts only here, in the assumed givenness of \co{actuality}. But this is a  story of further constructions from already constituted \co{actual} contents.    Before I can begin to build \co{complexes} from their components, I had to  acquire enough \co{distinctions}. This did not happen at once but is a  continuous process. Once enough \co{distinctions} have been made, I may  proceed to distinguish further and, at the same time, compose them into  \co{complexes}.  Some of such \co{complexes} I call `Prague'', ``Europe'' and  some others ``chair'', ``horse'', ``irritation''.  I may arrive at the  supposed concept of a chair through a series of experiences, some analysis and  abstraction.  But if I am to arrive at anything whatsoever, I had to have the  {\em experience} of various chairs and I had to make a \co{cut} through the  sphere of my whole \co{experience} which brought forth this \co{complex}. No  matter what I arrive at, will always leave room for further possibility of  \co{distinction}.  }\ad{{Eidos}, {noema} and {anamnesis}}\label{anamnesis}%Turning the tension between the fleeting \co{actuality} of particulars and the\co{presence} of universals into an opposition, then putting all kinds ofnon-\co{actuality} and \co{non-actuality} -- concepts, universals, ideas,values, souls -- into one sack of the \thi{spiritual} as opposed to the\thi{material} and, finally, recognising the effective reality of the spiritual,one will easily come up with some \thi{unchangeable essences} stored in an\thi{ideal, intelligible world}. Roughness of this operation, also when seen inthe light of attempts to provide a rational counterpart of mythology, opens toomuch space to be addressed in detail here. It infected the whole tradition withthe \thi{intelligible world of Ideas} which, somehow, emerged ready-made fromthe {original One} or from God's mind.\ftnt{The doctrine which made Forms/Ideas  cease to live their own life and become concepts of the divine mind \noo{seems    to appear for the first time in the second century \add with} is present in  Philo of Alexandria,\kilde{De opificio mundi,17;20} Atticus,\kilde{Fr.9,40}  \citeauthor*{HandPlat}{ IX,XIV}.  \citeauthor*{DivineForms} presents the  history of the transition.} Thus predetermined and fixed, it hangs over \co{this  world} as a static double -- \thi{intelligible} only in empty postulatesbecause, as a matter of fact, completely incomprehensible and in constant needof being someway connected to \co{this world}.\gre{Anamnesis}, learning as recollection, arises easily from such a sublimationof \co{concepts} and their assumed \thi{essences} to the level of the immortalhabitat of the soul.\noo{We leave it to the post-Heideggerians with  philological inclinations to investigate the obvious linguistic parallel which  links the theory of \gre{anamnesis} to the privative form of \wo{truth} in  Greek, \wo{\gre{aletheia}} -- relating \gre{lethe} to the waters of  forgetfulness, \wo{\gre{a-letheia}} reads as  \thi{non-forgetfulness}.\label{nonforget}} But Socrates' \gre{maieusis}, asexemplified in \btit{Meno}, need no such speculative foundation.  If\co{reflection} finds only the \co{distinctions} in the \co{experience}, thenobviously what it finds has already been there -- it is a \co{repetition}.  Theonly thing one has to do is to identify soul with the \co{reflective precision},rational explicitness, and call its emergence from \co{experience} into the\co{actuality} \wo{birth}, to postulate that the soul knew these ideas beforebirth.The questions which Socrates asks constitute the whole and essential element ofgetting the right answers from Meno's slave. \wo{To ask the right question is half the solution of the problem.} The questions involve the relevant\co{distinctions} of which the boy had been unaware, which he had not made(or not connected) before.  The procedure might be pedagogically admirable butit proves nothing of what Plato would like to put into it.  Being able to make the relevant\co{distinctions} and identifications is different from having actually madethem -- making them is precisely that: making {\em new} \co{distinctions},getting {\em new} insights.  Thatthe boy is able to follow the geometric argument (yes -- argument!)  of Socratesshows simply that he is not entirely stupid, that he can \co{recognise} the\co{distinctions} and their relations suggested by Socrates. Finally, thepossibility of a \co{distinction} being at all made is different from it actually having beingmade and stored ready in some \thi{intelligible world}, \thi{divine mind}, orwhatever depot one manages to imagine.\noo{Used as an argument for immortality of soul, it is only a smart piece ofsophistry.}Soul's immortality remains as open an issue after the argument as it was before.However, we will not dismiss the Idea so easily.

A \co{concept} is then a \co{concept} {\em of} theIdea, is a \co{reflective} attempt to repeat the (limit of) \co{experiential  distinctions} as an \co{actual} construction.\noo{Thus, the \co{concept}  \thi{blue} tries to capture the well-known blueness, the \co{concept}  \thi{friendship} the known and possible \co{experiences} of friendship, etc.,  but also the emerging \co{concept} \thi{group} the felt, \co{vaguely} intuited  and more and more \co{precisely recognised} nexus of properties and  significance (cf.~footnote~{\small{\ref{ftnt:group}}}).} Such repetitive character ofconcepts and explicit understanding would square well with the postulates thatIdeas are perfect exemplars to be merely imitated by the \co{actual} things andthinking. But the value of such repetitions becomes the more dubious the deeperand more personal/spiritual issues they try to capture. \noo{But in the lower  spheres of \co{objects} and \co{complexes} they are the source of control so  clearly manifested in the technological power.} We hardly have any\co{precise} Ideas of justice, goodness or beauty to be merely imitated. Thisother property of Ideas -- most clearly seen in the used examples -- namely,that of being lofty and \co{vague} generalities, comes closer to our\co{virtuality}. In this sense, Idea would correspond to a \co{virtual nexus}which is not so much imitated as simply \co{actualised} by the things and\co{concepts}. Even if one might still say that such an \co{actual concept} is{\em of} the respective Idea, the \wo{of} has a very different meaning than inthe previous case. In either case, Aristotle's critique of Plato, amounting toreplacing Ideas by mere \co{concepts}, was possible because the two were notsufficiently distinguished.  Unfortunately, the replacement amounted to a simplereduction.\noo{(even God is, with Aristotle, just the tram driver, if not the  tram engine).} The tradition attempting to reconcile the two masters, hastried to correct this unfortunate replacement maintaining both elements of thedistinction, albeit in various forms and often only as a distinction between twokinds of concepts.\ftnt{Plotinus, for instance, views the concepts (our original  universals) as a kind of \thi{impressions} received from the Intellect and  thus distinct from those received from the senses (for which we would have to  substitute all secondary abstractions). The soul comprehends \wo{the    impressions, superior and inferior}: \citef{The reasoning-principle in the    Soul acts upon the representations standing before it as the result of    sense-perception; these it judges, combining, distinguishing: or it may also    observe the impressions, so to speak, rising from the    Intellectual-Principle, and has the same power of handling these; and    reasoning will develop to wisdom where it recognises the new and late-coming    impressions [those of sense] and adapts them, so to speak, to those it holds    from long before -- the act which may be described as the soul's    Reminiscence.}{Plotinus}{V:3.2} The history and examples of the issue are  reviewed in \citeauthor*{ConceptPlat}.}  We do not contest the reality (norsignificance, nor creative potential, nor technological relevance) of this\thi{Aristotelian} thread but only its primacy, not to mention, exclusiveness.\subsub{Ego, body, action, control}\wtsep{complex - ego}\pa The kind of \co{complexes} one is able to relate to, their character anddegree of complexity is relative to one's skills -- skills to differentiate and,at the same time, to \co{re-cognise} the interplay of various aspect within onetotality.  Unlike bare \co{objects}, \co{complexes} are not relative to one'smere presence, but to one's shrewdness, intelligence, skill to see theconnections; also to one's capacity of compassion and sympathy, of predictingother's way of thinking and acting, etc.What is a \co{complex} for one person need not be so for another. Having more orless the same organs of perception and similarcapacities for discrimination, we typically agree on the status of singlethings and \co{objects}. But many of these things may not even existin the world of a bat, whose perception mechanisms will doom irrelevant, i.e., leaveunrecognised, many things we distinguish. On the other hand, adog's smell will differentiate things and situations which, for us, may seemcompletely indistinct. Different humans can, similarly, have differentabilities of forming and connecting \co{complexes} which, to some extent, aresmoothened by functioning in a linguistic community where words establish muchof inter-subjective agreement on a host of \co{distinctions}.  This applies forskills at all levels.  For a professor of algebra, the rings are quite differentthings from groups; a student may, to begin with, have problems with seeing thatthese are two different \co{complexes}; an illiterate may not even understandthat one is talking about anything meaningful.  In short, the complexity of theworld one lives and acts in, the complexity of \co{complexes} one relates to isthe reflection of the \co{complex} of one's skills and abilities which we call\wo{\co{ego}}.%(not to say, of the \co{Ego} complex) and vice versa.\wtsep{ego is outside (transcendent)}\pa\co{Ego} is the aspect of a person which can be reduced to \co{actual}expressions and described in \co{actual} terms. It reminds a bit of Jung's\thi{persona} as opposed to \thi{person},\noo{\wo{social person} as opposed to the\wo{intimate person} in Scheler, though with him it concerns self-perception inwhich also the latter is capable of all kinds contacts with others, not onlyegotic social contacts, while the former is ultimate site of \ger{Einsamkeit},Formalismus p.549} in so far as \thi{persona} is a\co{totality} of \co{externalised} properties, comparable to the similarproperties of others and observable within the \hoa. The inquisitive attitude ofthe guy from the pub who became \thi{the detective} belongs to his\co{ego}. (The \co{trace} may, of course, go deeper.) \co{Ego} is the first object encountered by a simple, teenager's form ofself-reflection. It does not address being or, if it does, it does so onlyindirectly. It is primarily occupied with the facts \co{that I am so-and-so}.\wo{I have too round face.}, \wo{I have too light hair.}, \wo{I won't wear this  -- what would others think?} Such worries pass quickly into slightly morefundamental ones, marking the crisis of adolescence, which, nevertheless, stillcarry the \co{egotic} character: \wo{I am not as good as he is.} \wo{I am  insensitive.} \wo{I am ugly.}Such characteristics and self-characteristics, genuine and honest as they mayhappen to be, consist of {objectified} attributes which get attached to theirnoumenal subject as some \co{external} properties. \co{Ego}, we could say, isoneself viewed from \thi{outside}, withother's eyes. But even when others are not invoked, \co{ego} is still\thi{outside} oneself: any predicate involves, at least implicitly, a comparisonand, moreover, it happens only to be some \co{actually} observable fact whichnever manages to reach the intended \thi{innermost essence} of one's person.The non-\co{actuality} of a \co{complex} is of the same kind as thenon-\co{actuality} of \co{ego}. It is not {\em essential} \co{non-actuality} butonly non-\co{actuality} of something which might, or even was, \co{actual} atsome other time.  \co{Ego} is a person filtered through the \co{actualising}sieve of \co{reflection}.  \citet{The Ego never appears except on the occasion  of a reflective act.}{TEgo}{p.53; Sartre has ``I'' and not ``Ego'' here.}  Andit appears always \thi{as} -- confused, smart, late, amiable\ldots \co{Ego}signifies a \co{complex} of properties, features, facts each of which, takenseparately, may be perfectly \co{actual}.  \co{Ego} is such a \co{complex} offeatures, skills, ways of behaviour, etc.  which one attributes to a person.  Itconstitutes the subjective pole of \co{actual experiences} of \co{complexes}.\citetib{The Ego is the unity of states and actions -- optionally, of  qualities.}{TEgo}{p.61} \co{Ego} is the \thi{ideal} unity (\co{posited} andnever experienced) of skills, abilities, qualities and actions.\noo{The unity of  \co{ego} is only \thi{ideal} because it is \co{founded} in the deeper layer of  \co{myself}.}\noo{Although identifying \co{oneself} with one's \co{Ego} is not a healthy  attitude, the devaluation of \co{ego}, of \co{my actual} determinations and  capacities, may easily result, for instance, in the inability to \co{act} and  interact successfully with the \co{actual world}.}\wtsep{body is actuality (for reflection -- always transcendent)}%\pa Besides skills and abilities, the fundamental \co{aspect} of \co{ego} is thebody. The \oss\ of \co{actuality} are often relative to the body. \wo{It is  nice} does not refer the feeling to a particular organ (even if it emergesthere) but to the whole body which \wo{feels nice}. On the other hand, it is notrelative to the \co{I}.  Even if we might say \wo{I feel nice}, it is only afeeling \co{I} {\em have}, not something \co{I} am. (Contrary to the case whensaying \wo{I am nice}.)Thus body, although most intimately \co{mine}, appears for \co{reflective  attention} as foreign, as \co{external} as all the contents of the \co{ego} --\co{mine}, yet impersonal.  More generally, all the \co{signs} of \co{actuality}are relative to such an impersonal feeling of vitality, of life -- it is not somuch {\em my} life, as life in general, even if it is actually my experience.The \co{mood} of vigor and vital strength is the feeling of \thi{my {\em life}}rather than of \thi{{\em my} life}. Vital feelings signal flow or ebb, increaseor decrease of life energy, and it is this life energy, only, so to speak,accidentally seated and felt in one's body, which is their primary correlate.\wtsep{body -- also, horizon of action} \noo{ \co{Actions} are not correlated  with, are not expressions of an instantaneous \co{subject}. They are vital  functions of an organism, of a whole body or else of our controlling and  manipulative abilities. }\pa The \hoa\ is marked by one's body and if we were to play the games withwords, we could say: body is the \co{sign} of the \hoa.  Body anchors one in the\co{actuality} and, by this very token, encircles the horizon of one's\co{action}.  The horizon of \co{action} can be taken as synonymous with the\hoa.  \co{Action} is not merely an \co{act}, an \co{immediate} \co{reflex} orother minute movement -- of body or mind -- consummated in a single moment.\co{Action} unfolds in the entirety of the \hoa, it addresses all, or several ofthe \co{actual} aspects. From the point of view of \co{attentive reflection} wemay always say that \co{action} consists of a series of \co{acts} but one canequally well say the opposite: an \co{act} is an \co{aspect} of an \co{action}(unless it is an entirely spontaneous, that is mad, outburst unrelated toanything in its vicinity).A single \co{object} is a correlate of an \co{act}. Similarly, a \co{sign} of a\co{complex} is a correlate of a single \co{act}. However, a \co{complex}itself isn't merely a correlate of a single \co{act}. It may be a correlate ofan \co{action}, one can manipulate it, act upon it for a specific purpose, onecan think and reason about it, assemble or disassemble it, in short, bring itunder one's control.  \co{Objects} are under one's control only to the degree towhich they are parts of \co{complexes}. \co{Object} itself, as a purely\co{immediate} given of consciousness, and considered only as such, appears in asomehow impulsive fashion, \refp{pa:madSpontaneity}.  It emerges for no apparentreason, {\em ex nihilo}, and offers consciousness only the\co{immediate} alternative: yes-no, take-avoid, accept-reject. Although objectserves as a paradigm of the controllable, taken in itself, it is not. Itbecomes so only when seen in the broader context of \co{visibility}, when it isseen as a \co{complex} or part of a \co{complex}.Just like sensations, limited to the \co{immediacy}, involve the responsiveattitude choosing between the bare alternative of pleasant/unpleasant, yes/no,so do \co{impressions} and \co{moods} involve immediately a response.  Theirunifying role is not only that they present us with a totality rather than itsparts, but that this presentation involves at the same time a reaction.  Fearcan be felt before its object is \co{recognised}, the source of satisfaction orirritation may remain unknown even when the \co{impressions} are felt clearlyand intensely. Often, though not always, the reaction precedes \co{recognition}of its reason.  To the extent the \co{complexes} are also given, \co{moods} and\co{impressions} disclose them through the unified \co{signs} which, at the sametime, are one's reactions to them.  \citet{When I use the word \thi{feeling} in  contrast to \thi{thinking}, I refer to a judgment of value -- for instance,  agreeable or disagreeable, good or bad, and so on.}{MHS}{I;p.49\noo{Jung}}\wtsep{control, more...}\pa \co{Concepts}, unlike \co{impressions}, lack this reactive aspect.Emphasizing the complexity of the \co{complexes}, they increase their\co{dissociation}, their isolation and, consequently, indifference.  Atthe same time, however, the resulting \co{externalisation} of distinct aspectsoffers us the possibility of manipulation and control.\noo{We see here  inadequacy of identifying the synthesising function with emotions and the  analyzing one with thinking. There are people of quite an emotional  intelligence; there are demagogues with quite a skill of grasping the feelings  of the masses. The power of such people to control and manipulate situations  is based on the analyzing skills, on the abilities to distinguish and relate  various aspects of a \co{complex}. However, it is hardly appropriate, in  general, to call such skills \wo{intellectual}.}  It is typical that what onerequires from a \co{concept}, and why one prizes it as something higher orbetter than an \co{impression}, is the more \co{precise} differentiation of itscomponents and their relations.  \co{Precision} is the result of\co{distinguishing} brought to the limits of \co{actuality}, into the closestpossible vicinity, into the \co{immediacy}. Unambiguous \co{precision} -- themark of instantaneous \co{immediacy} -- \co{founds} the possibility of control,but is not yet synonymous with it.  The crudest form of control, brutal physicalforce, conforms to this claim in that it can only be exercised on the\co{actual} \co{objects} in the immediate reach.  \noo{Its eventual goal, in the  whole of philosophical tradition, has been to remove the distinction between  the \co{sign} and the signified.}  \noo{It is a bit odd that {things} of  perception are actually the basic paradigms of such a closeness,  indubidability and clarity. They too, because of being determined by the lack  of the \co{sign}-signified distinction and because of the ``small enough''  size, fit within the narrow scope of our \co{actuality}, can be moved and  manipulated.}%\paControl is most naturally associated with the intellect, its source being the\co{dissociating} and \co{externalising} effects of \co{attentive reflection}. Control -- and this involves also some purposefulness -- requires individual\co{objects} to be \co{dissociated} and available for rearrangement. But itarises only with the multiplicity of \co{objects}, when they are included in a\co{complex} assigning to each its place and function. This \co{dissociation} isexactly the aspect which \co{moods} and \co{impressions} lack and thus, althoughaddressing the same \co{complexes}, they end up at the opposite end to\co{thoughts} and reasonings.  Eventually, also the control of reason overemotions amounts to approaching a \co{complex} through its complexity ratherthan unity. But as one should know very well, such a control is seldom as easyas control of the single \co{objects}. That is, control is the easier, the lesscomplicated, the more minutely determined \co{complex} it tries to control. Asingle cup is in my complete power in that I can, at any given moment simplysmash it. It would not, however, be so easily controllable if I wanted to changeits painting or shape, which would require viewing it as a rather complicated\co{complex}.  Likewise, lower emotional phenomena like sensual lust or evenpain, can be controlled by the will, that is, by \co{reflection}, to quite a highdegree. Often a mere change of the focus of attention can eliminate them.\co{Moods} and emotions, on the other hand, arisen by and making present muchmore complex situations, require much more analysis which only seldom bringsabout the control which could satisfy a true Stoic. \noo{or an average psychologist.}\subsub{Transcendence}%Control - but all slips out\pa A \co{complex}, emerging within the \hoa, appears as a single \co{object}which, in addition, consists of parts and properties which themselves can beseen as \co{objects}. As an \co{object}, it appears as \co{external} -- it isnot me.\ftnt{Everything we are saying here about \co{complexes} applies equally  to the specific \co{complex} of \co{ego}. I am not my \co{ego} -- I have it.  It is also \co{transcendent} in the way all \co{complexes} are, in the way  everything superficial or \co{actually} formalised is, as something foreign  (even if \co{mine}) and irrelevant (even if practically significant).}  Butits \co{transcendence} is not exhausted by the simple \co{externality}.  An\co{object} can suddenly reveal a new side which, as long as one merely focusedon its mere fact of being there, remained hidden.  We are thus alsoaware of the difference between the \co{actual sign} and its correlate; they donot coincide. Perceiving a house as a \co{complex}, one sees its front but alsoknows that it has a back-side. One knows it, that is, it is a part of theexperienced totality.  Yet, these two aspects are not present in the same way,and one is aware of this difference: one knows that there is \co{more} to the housethan what one is \co{actually} seeing of it.  In the same way, even if one sees thewhole room at once, one knows that one does not see all its aspects equally well.  Someare sharper, some dimmer, some are closer, some further away. And the same againwith a definition: one grasps the defined concept, has it in front of one's eyes inits intuitive totality, but one knows that one does not \co{actualise} all the details,that its complexity exceeds the \hoa, that it has a potential which can be usedor explained only through a lengthy labour. The \co{transcendence} of a\co{complex} involves thus the \co{more} which is merely indicated by the\co{actual sign}.  This \co{more} is not, in itself, anything qualitativelydifferent. It consists of \co{objects} and \co{complexes} of other, possible orpast, \co{experiences}.%\thesisnonr{\label{th:more}The \co{more} of a \co{complex} consists of  other \co{complexes}.}The difference between the \co{complex} and its \co{more} concerns only the wayof appearance -- the former is \co{actual} and the latter can be, but is notnow.  The \co{more} is not essential \co{non-actuality} but only somethingwhich, accidentally, happens not to be \co{actual} now.  This quantitative\co{more} constitutes the \co{horizontal aspect} of the \co{transcendence} of\co{complexes}.  It may be \co{more} of the same \co{complex} which is not\co{actual} at the moment, or it may be \co{more} \co{complexes} to which the\co{actual} one refers along some among the infinity of possible relations: asits cause or effect, as its predecessor or successor, as its part or its whole,as its motivation or purpose.  No matter how far one follows this dimension of\co{transcendence}, one never encounters anything but more \co{complexes} ormore complex \co{complexes}.  Eventually, one may reach the first or the secondantinomy of pure reason, where thinking in terms of \co{complexes} and theirrelations must stop: there is nothing \co{more} left and to the extent we assumethat there is, it can no longer serve us since its breadth and complexity makeit inaccessible to the \co{actuality of reflection}, the finitude of reason.%In this way, but also {\em only} in this way, the \co{more} of a \co{complex}tends towards its inexhaustibility, appears as the potentiality of an\co{external object} to disclose ever new and possibly unlimited number ofaspects, sides, relations. This inexhaustibility is the ideal limit of \co{more}and we will return to it in a moment. \pa The difference between the \co{actual sign} and the signified \co{complex},the difference experienced now between the \co{actuality} andnon-\co{actuality}, marks also the experience of temporality.  The \co{more} ofa \co{complex}, the surplus hiding behind its given surface, is actually hidingin its temporality. All \co{complexes} are temporal in the sense that theyemerge as unity of multiplicity, as \co{actual objects} which are not {\em  fully} present, which have something \co{more}.\noo{Heidegger's temporality,  based on the \co{projects} casting things and situations towards their purpose  and destination seem to me a particular, if ingenious, case. A baby, seeing  its mother approaching and leaving, must be involved in a temporal  apprehension -- without having any projects or intentions. Stumbling  accidentally onto a chair, which yields and moves a bit, must arise the  \co{re-cognition} of this chair having, if nothing else, the potential of  occupying different positions. True, it is a construction, and the temporality  implied rather latent and not reflectively experienced. But it does leave a  mark for the rest of the life; the mark of seeing the chair having the same  potential of appearing through different \co{signs} as all other things will  always have.}  They are temporally -- though only temporarily --\thi{stretched} and it is not merely one of their features but an indispensable\co{aspect} of their appearance as \co{complexes}.\noo{This might remind of  transcendental constitution if one were to take the temporality as a necessary  condition of such an experience. But it is not a condition -- it is a  constitutive \co{aspect} of the experience.  It is hair-splitting but \ldots  temporality is not any {\em a priori} form, independent from experience. It is  a part of experience, it is the experience of the \co{actual} and the  \co{non-actual} aspects of a \co{complex}.  Moreover, this temporality is {\em    noting else} than the very \co{complexity} of \co{complexes}, i.e., an  \co{aspect} of the same \nexus.}The \co{horizontal transcendence} of a \co{complex} is thus not mere \co{externality} but \co{more}, which involves also temporality stretching  beyond\co{here-and-now}. \wtsep{vertical...: the more the less}\pa The \co{actuality} constitutes the \co{vertical aspect} of the \co{transcendence} with respect to the level of \co{immediacy}. \co{Complexes} give the single \co{objects} thecontext in which the  arbitrariness of the mere \co{that it is} may find the first form of meaning: a purpose, a reason,  a relation to other \co{objects}. Now, the \co{complexes}, the {objectified} relations of the level of \co{actuality}, reveal an analogous \thi{meaninglessness} indicating the \co{vertical dimension} of \co{transcendence}.It seems to be a popular way of expressing dissatisfaction with the\co{representational} form of \co{reflective} thinking and the mere\co{objectivity} of \co{dissociated} \thi{substances} -- referring everything tosome \thi{context}.  There are innumerable variants which it would be impossibleto review here.  On the one hand, it has the charming appeal by introducing,although often only by implicature, the \co{subject}, since context is hardlysomething which can be determined in purely \co{objective} terms.  On the otherhand, since it is actually impossible to determine what context might possiblymean and what might possibly constitute a legitimate context for anything, onetends to extend it as far as \ldots everything.  All pointers to coherence,totality, \thi{the whole}, are ways of \thi{contextualisation}, along with themore mundane attempts to put everything in the \thi{historical context}, the\thi{social context}, the \thi{inferential context}, the \thi{context of usage},etc.  Admirable as many of such attempts may be, they suffer from theinaccessibility of the eventual \co{more}. \thi{Context} tries to function as asurrogate for the negative aspect of every \co{recognition} and\thi{contextualisation}, starting with the \co{reflectively dissociated}\thi{atoms}, meets almost immediately the combinatorial barriers,\refp{pa:pragmaticPositive}.  If we have $n$ atoms and, in principle, anycombination thereof might be a context, we get $2^{n}$ contexts.  Take half ofthem, one-tenth -- as $n$ increases, the number of contexts becomes very quicklyunmanageable.  Although context indeed points toward something endowing the\co{object} or the \co{complex} with a purpose, if not with meaning, it is hardto imagine how taking such (unmanageable number of) contexts into account issupposed to help understanding a given \thi{atom} $x$. The only manageable, ifnot also the only important, question concerns which context to choose (which isnothing else but the question about the limits of $x$.)\pa\label{pa:smartStupid} The \co{more objective} contexts to investigate, theless understanding of the investigated issue; the \co{more} informationavailable, the more difficult to find any relevant, not to mention valuable,information; the \co{more} ambitious professor of the more \co{imprecise} subject (psychology, sociology,literature), the \co{more} attempts at mathematical \co{precision} in his research; the more persons with higher education,the more stupid and less knowledgeable each one of them.

But, the \co{more} comprehensive -- the less comprehensible.  Theinversion reveals a lack. The \co{more} intensely one focuses on the \co{actual  complexities}, the less sense and meaning one finds in them.  The more one'sunderstanding approaches the self-secure enlightenment of scientism, theintellectual self-confidence or the safety of a bourgeois sterility, the greaterthe chance that one may wake up as Gregor Samsa in Kafka's \btit{Metamorphosis}-- in the known, safe surroundings, in the same orderly house, in one's own bed,but transformed into a cockroach scared, or rather merely pacified, by theinexplicable event of a meaningless loss of one's so far obvious and unproblematicidentity. At the limit of \co{more} one encounters~\ldots oneself, even if oftenonly as one's own caricature. The subject is encountered at the limit of the world and, perhaps, onlythere. \citet{The subject does not belong to the world: rather it is a limit of  the world.}{Tract}{5.632 [The statement seems to apply most adequately to  \co{myself}, although Wittgenstein's \thi{subject} or \thi{philosophical self}  \citefib{is not the human being, not the human body, or the human soul, with    which psychology deals, but rather the metaphysical subject, the limit of    the world -- not a part of it.}{Tract}{5.641} \co{I}, unlike \co{ego}, is  its world by being its limit, the horizon within which life unfolds, as we  will describe shortly.]}%\noo{  -- but \co{I}, being its world and human  being, is not the ultimate \thi{metaphysical subject}, for \citef{man    infinitely transcends man}{Pensees}{VII:434}, as we will discuss in the  following Section, and then in Book III.}%But although never \co{actually} encountered, it is \co{present} in the worldfrom the very beginning.  The \co{objectivity} of a \co{complex} consists in its being given as an \co{object}in \co{actual experience} and, moreover, in the fact that its \co{more} is justmore of the \co{actual}, \co{objective} aspects. However, to the extent that a\co{complex} is not given \co{immediately} in its full complexity, it bearsalways a mark of \thi{subjectivity}. This is no longer the \co{subjectivity} ofan ideal, purely \co{actual subject}, but a much more genuine \thi{subjectivity}understood as that which brings non-\co{actuality}, and eventually also\co{non-actuality}, into \co{experience}.  The status of \co{complexes} as\co{external} and independent from us is much less evident than in the case ofsimple \co{objects} encountered by \co{reflection that it is}. This aspect of \thi{subjectivity}, the presence of the \co{ego complex}, becomesmanifest, for instance, in the questions like: Can I be sure that it is one andthe same object? If I leave and come back, how can I know that it is the same?It is a bit hard to know what \wo{to know} means in such questions, but we sensethat the lack of \co{immediate} certainty is taken as the possibility of error,that is, \thi{subjectivity}. I -- my sight, my memory, my understanding, any ofmy faculties, in short, my \co{ego} -- can be mistaken. Certainly, in somecases, one can be mistaken. However, in most cases, one experiences thisidentity with such an infallible certainty that, if one were to doubt it, onecould not be certain of anything. As Wittgenstein says: the burden lies here onthose asking such questions -- the burden of explaining what they would consideras knowing.\noo{Of course, from our perspective such questions do not posit big  problem. We are not constructing the world from a dispersed multiplicity of  independent \co{actualities}. On the contrary, it is \co{actualities} which  emerge from a unity of the background of \co{experience} which, in terms of  objective time, is a lasting unity. A \co{complex} is \co{cut from experience}  which stretches beyond the \hoa, and enters it only through particular  \co{signs}. By this very token, it is precisely something which has been  delineated as extending beyond this horizon. It is the \co{actual experience},  the \co{immediacy} of an \co{object}, which is secondary, which is  \co{founded} upon a prior \co{distinction} of a \co{complex}.}  We will notdeny the possibility of doubt but only observe that it arises exclusively fromthe assumption that the only certainty can be obtained in the \co{immediacy} andthat everything which \co{transcends} its \co{objective} \thi{givens} threatenswith error, that is, \thi{subjectivity}. For if all that is real are\co{immediate objects}, then even the relations between them, especiallythe relations across time, turn out to be \thi{subjective}.\pa \co{Ego} is the \co{aspect} of subjectivity within the \hoa. But as one asksfor \co{more and more}, as the \co{totality} of \co{complexes} extendsbeyond the limits of one's possibilities and, gradually, begins to dissolve inthe flux of \co{experience}, \co{ego}'s status becomes more and more dubious.  Theideal limit of \co{more}, the ideal \co{totality} of \co{complexes}, \co{this  world} as a \co{totality} of things, is also the place where \co{ego} beginsto dissolve in the \co{experienced chaos}.  The obsessive rigidity of asystematic organisation, when carried to the extremes, creates eventually madpandemonium, whether on personal or social scale.  The ever renewed and neveraccomplished project of control encounters \co{more} in the most dramaticfashion.  When absolutised and driven beyond its proper limits, it makes oneacutely aware of the uncontrollable \co{more} which lurks in the depth ofeverything which one believes to control.  The disappointments of the projectsof total appropriation, the failed attempts to control the inexhaustible\co{more}, throw us back onto ourselves -- for the limit of the \co{horizontal  transcendence} is always but a shadow of its \co{vertical aspect}.The subject, implicitly \co{present} all the time, is encountered by\co{reflection} at the limit of {objectivity}.  But the subject encountered thusat the limit of the world is encountered only as its own absence, as the lack ofsomething which should be there but which is not.  For it is neither the\co{immediate subject} of a \co{reflective act} nor the \co{egotic complex} of\co{dissociated} properties.  It is something personal, something which neverbecomes \co{precisely visible} within the \co{totality} of \thi{objective}determinations and \thi{subjective} \la{qualia}. Insatiability -- whether ofHegelian conceptualisations, of positivistic optimism, of sociologicaleschatologism, of progressive scientism or of those who, bored by the abundanceof all past novelties, await impatiently for the next novelty which will finallycure their boredom -- all forms of insatiability breed, eventually,dissatisfaction, the feeling of unfulfillment and incompleteness, of brokenpromise, perhaps nihilism. From these ashes, when the impassable limit of\co{more and more} has been left \co{below}, there emerges the more genuinelysubjective, the personal, the Nietzschean or Kierkegaardian.\noo{    \pa Reaching and feeling the limits, it is no surprise that one may be tempted  to announce the end of philosophy, the end of reason, to renounce  \co{conceptual} thinking for the sake of literature, poetry or mysticism or,  as one likes to say, for \thi{thinking otherwise}. After all, they are  concerned with life and what else was the original motivation? Such acts may  witness to a deep personal choice and should not be disrespected. Yet, they  may also reflect the despair over reason's inability to embrace everything  which arises when everything is misunderstood for a mere \co{more}, a mere  \co{complexity} of \co{objects} and problems which all have to be analyzed  down to the minutest detail. Such an everything, an inexhaustible \co{more}  unveils the finitude and end of our skills. But is it {\em the} end?    It just so happens that thinking requires \co{representations}, it is the art  of manipulating and arranging \co{signs} which \co{represent}.  And \co{signs}  are just \co{signs} -- not things themselves.  What makes thinking \thi{good    thinking} is not a narcissistic self-complacency with its own coherence,  consistency, inter-textual contextuality and what not, but that it manages to  stay in touch with things its \co{signs} signify.  It is, in fact, often as  difficult as it sounds trivial.  One may try renouncing \co{signs} and  \co{representations}, but then one does not start \thi{thinking otherwise} but  simply stops thinking and starts doing something else.  Even if one  \thi{thinks otherwise} that the original temporality, life, experience is an  ecstatic unity, one still buys oneself a watch and goes around one's own  business. If thinking about such daily trivialities is not satisfactory then,  perhaps, one should start thinking about something deeper rather than trying  to \thi{think otherwise}.    \pa The personal, the \co{subjective} in the sense of the presence of  \co{non-actual}, is also the sphere of meaning.  The questions about the  meaning (which never can be reduced to the purpose) of particular things and,  eventually, of their totality, about the sense of things and of doing things  bring invariably the questions about \co{myself}, about the place of  \co{myself} in the world, about other peoples' influence on and relation to  me. These are the questions which reveal the vertical dimension of the  transcendence of \co{actuality}.  They are not merely naive attempts to ask  about the \thi{meaning of the world and life}. They are most natural questions  which become the more pressing and relevant (even if not explicit), the more  one directs one's attention to the \co{complexes} and their \co{objective}  relations, the more one's \co{reflection} focuses on things within the world.}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MINE\subsection{Mineness}\label{sec:levelC}\pa\label{refl:C}The confrontation with the chaos of \co{experience}, with the limitations of my\co{ego}, of my skills and powers, suspends the importance of objective factsand relations and engenders the \co{reflection that  I am}.  It marks a breach in the continuity of being presenting \co{myself}in as astonishing a light of \co{dissociated} independence as the realisation\co{that it is} did earlier with a simple \co{object}.  \co{Reflection that it is}, themere observation \thi{that\ldots} of \co{object}'s \co{immediacy},\co{dissociates} it and presents it as being \thi{on its own}.  \co{Reflection  that I am}, the mere observation \thi{that\ldots} of my \co{presence}, does thesame with me.  In so far as I am considered in the \co{actuality} of this\co{act}, that is, in so far as I am considered as its \co{object}, I appear asisolated from the world, from any origin, I am alone, \thi{on my own}. By thesame token, it seems, I am free, absolutely, unreservedly; I emerge {\em ex  nihilo} with the same ungrounded arbitrariness as an \co{object} appears for apurely \co{actual subject} -- it is, but might not be, and there is no apparentreason for its being rather than not being, or for its being so rather thanotherwise. On my own  -- as freeas arbitrary, as unconstrained as meaningless. This \co{dissociation} from the world, similar to any \co{object}'s, isnot accompanied by the similar \co{externality}.  Such \co{externality} belongsstill to the \co{ego} which is a collection of \co{externalised} contents. Here,on the contrary, I know, in the immediate self-consciousness, that it is me\co{myself} I encounter, an enigmatic site of continuous self-sameness.  Theenigma concerns precisely the sameness of \co{myself} who am reflecting in thisvery moment and \co{myself} who was yesterday, years ago, and whom I am going tobe in all my future. And, surely, as long as one stays with the categories of\co{actuality} alone, as long as one yields to the unreserved claims of\co{objectivistic illusion}, this sameness poses an ever perplexing problem. Inparticular, because one, being unable to deny the experience of sameness,reverses the order of \co{founding} and tries, as Hume and others did, to refer itback to, if not derive it from, the \co{visible} contents or, what amounts tothe same, to reduce \co{oneself} to the \co{visibility} of the \co{ego}.\pa \co{Reflection} over \co{myself}, or \co{self-reflection}, is an \co{act}which attempts to \co{actualise} its intended \co{object}, but for which thisobject immediately slips away and remains a mere noumenal site.  And\co{self-reflection}, in the immediate \co{self-consciousness}, is \co{aware} ofthis insufficiency. In it one admits that one is something much more than whatcan be made \co{actual} in any single \co{here-and-now}.  One \co{re-cognises}\co{oneself} as oneself, that is, although one can never grasp oneself fully inthe \hoa, one knows that all the \co{signs} given in \co{self-reflection} pointto {\em oneself}, shallower or deeper appearances of mineness. One may discoverdark and unexpected sides, but they are all intimately {\em one's own} sides,they are not, in any way, alien, \co{external}.  All the \co{signs} signify somecharacteristics of \co{oneself}, they appear as {\em one's} characteristics, asrecurring themes of {\em one's} character, personality, being.In \co{self-reflection} one \co{experiences} \co{oneself} as transcending the\hoa, but merely as some noumenal site of identity.  One knows one's identitywhich extends over time -- not because one managed to \co{re-construct} andcomprehend it but simply because one knows it. \co{Experience} of thisidentity precedes any particular \co{act} of \co{reflection} and extends beyondit. It is \co{experienced} in the course of one's whole life and does not dependon one's reflecting over it or not. One knows it long before one\co{reflectively} thinks about it.  If \co{experiences} can transcend the \hoa\ and be essentially \co{non-actual}, then so can the experiencing being. In thisform of \co{reflection}, one \co{represents} oneself as a being whose identityis not, like \co{ego's}, constructed from the \co{actual} contents, but extendsover time and can only be made present for \co{reflection} by means of more orless inadequate indications, allusions, \co{signs}.%\ad{Temporality}\noo{The \wo{other-worldliness} of \co{the experience} (not only of the  \co{reflection}) \co{that I am} is based on the experience of another mode of  temporality. The \co{I} does somewhat participate in the objective temporality  of things of this world but, at the same time, it is outside it, it has its  {\em own} time, its {\em own} past and future. In so far as this time is also  considered an objective time, this is but a result of \co{reflection}  isolating \co{myself} as its \co{object}. But \thi{my time} is also an  expression of \co{myself} as a temporal being, of my \co{experienced} time,  eventually, of the unity of my being which precedes its temporal  determinations.  }\pa Just like the temporal scope of \co{subject} (and \co{object}) is pure\co{here-and-now}, while of \co{ego} (and \co{complexes}) some finite andlimited time, the \co{I} of the reflection \co{that I am} is finite butunlimited -- it has no \co{experienced} beginning nor end. My birth is something\co{I} may be told about but not something \co{I} experience; my death is aperpetual not-yet.\noo{ and even when it approaches \co{I} do not experience  death but dying.} \co{I} am stretched, or better, \co{I} am stretching\co{myself} between these two limits, both real and yet ideal, since foreverinaccessible.They are \co{actual} only when projected onto the objective time, as particularpoints on its line.  The apprehension of the finitude of my being (hereof its temporal span) emerges thus as the result of imposing its idealend-points onto the infinite line of objective time.  The infinity of this lineis, of course, not experienced but only thought, and that only in terms of\co{more}, that is, as potential infinity. % -- nobody thinks the actually infinite but one can easily say: no matter how far% the time has gone, it will go still further.But one can perform the opposite operation of mapping the infinite line onto, forinstance, finite but {\em open} interval, or on a finite circle (as infigure~I:\refp{pa:stages}, p.\pageref{fi:stages}).  The ideal end-points (which donot belong to an open interval, while on the circle become the same pole) becomethen the image of the infinity -- the point in infinity. This point functionsthus as the beginning, and the end, of the supposedly infinite line. We couldsay that this folding of the objective line onto finite circle represents\thi{relativisation} of the objective time to the temporality of my being.The question ``What was before the beginning of the world?'' is as unavoidablefrom the perspective of objective time, that is, at the level of \co{actuality},as it is unanswerable.  Potential infinity of the objective time is the backboneof the proof of the antithesis of the first antinomy. \co{Objectivistic  illusion}, being based on the unwarranted extrapolation, can not admit anylimits -- there is always \co{more} and time must be infinite. On the otherhand, the intuition of \co{origination}, of the ideal \co{unexperienced}beginning and end is the source of the respective thesis.  The antinomy reflectsthus again the mixture of levels, where the \co{objectivistic} infinity isconfronted with the \co{experiential} finitude, the unimaginable beginning-endwith the intuited \co{origin}.  Temporality emerges only from the\co{separation} of an \co{existence}, that is, it has an \co{origin}, though nota beginning nor end. Beginning and end are only {objectified} images of the\co{origin}.  This time which has \co{originated} somewhere but which hasneither beginning nor end, the finite yet unlimited time, is the temporalcontext of the experience \co{that I am}.\subsub{The signs}The experience \co{that I am} is \co{an experience} suspending the unquestionedvalidity of the objective world.  The \co{signs} of \co{mineness} are no longerrelative to specific organs nor even to the whole body; they are no longersensations nor vital feelings; they are no longer localised, are not narrowed tothe context of \co{actuality}. Laughter of a happy man is different from thelaughter of a desperate man, even if they both laugh at the same things.  The\oss\ of \co{mineness} are kind of feelings; not, however, mere \co{moods}related to the \co{actual} situation, but feelings modifying its perception,\thi{soulful} feelings, relative to the \co{quality} of one's life or, if youprefer, of one's \co{soul}.%\newpa\ad{Original signs}%\co{Emotions}% fix a bit: are qualities of life the \oss, or only what the % \oss signify ?The \oss\ at this level are what we will call \wo{\co{qualities of life}}, orshortly \wo{\co{qualities}}.  Most vaguely, these are just feelings -- however,not ones concerning a particular thing, situation or person, but the feelingsconcerning some \co{vague unity}: of {\em my} life, of the world, of life.Phenomenologically, one might perhaps say that \thi{my life} is their noematiccorrelate. But it is rather so that they are given as qualities penetrating thehorizon of my life, not as its more or less accidental properties, but as thequalities constituting the very character of this horizon.  They are not\co{signs} of anything particular, of any things or situations as\co{impressions} were; they are not relative to my \co{ego} but to \co{myself};they are not specific, situated \co{moods} but \co{qualities} of the whole:life, my experience, the world. We notice easily such a \co{quality} with achild, often even before it starts talking. (The absence of verbal communicationseems to increase receptivity for other kinds of messages.) The whole future canbe seen -- not, of course, any details concerning the development, career andthe like, not any specific events of the future but \thi{the whole future}, the\co{quality} of the person, \noo{ perhaps, some \vo{virtual} character traits}the \co{quality} of his life.\ftnt{For instance, \citef{Plotinus foretold also    the future of each of the children in the household: for instance, when    questioned as to Polemon's character and destiny he said: \wo{He will be      amorous and short-lived}: and so it proved.}{lifePlot}{11.}}  This strongimpression we often get from children becomes, with the adults, weakened by thenoise of all more specific features, habits and norms but, our claim goes, itremains the same \co{quality}.\pa A feeling of peace may arise in a particular situation and be experienced asrelating to this -- peaceful -- situation only.  But \co{qualities} like\thi{peaceful}, even if uncovered by \co{moods} and \co{impressions}, are notreserved for particular situations within the world.  The same \co{qualities}may appear in a more intimate, deeper and hence more intense fashion as the\co{qualities of life}. There is a fundamental difference between a feeling ofelation situated in a concrete situation and the joy of life which is only\co{actualised} in a particular situation.  What distinguishes them is that thelatter lack any \co{objective} correlates, any \co{complexes} which might beidentified as their site, their proper origin.  \co{Complexes} are here onlysites where such feelings are \co{actualised}, not by which they are caused.  Afeeling of peace, in the sense of a \co{quality of life}, as a \co{sign} of\co{mineness}, even if experienced in a particular context, is not limited byit, is not experienced as exclusively a quality of this moment but, on thecontrary, as something which is merely \co{actualised} in it and which is a muchmore solid quality of something deeper.  A feeling of joy, as a \co{quality of  life}, is not the vital feeling of elation and vigour which may pass or changeinto its opposite in the matter of hours or minutes. It is a calm feeling of mylife which, through all the variations of vital feelings and \co{moods}, throughall the variations of situated joys and sorrows, victories and defeats, unveilsa theme which underlies and as if surrounds all of them.  The \co{qualities of  life} constitute as if a deeper layer of \co{moods} and \co{impressions}. Theyare \co{experienced} underneath variations of different situations which, inthemselves, give rise to very different \co{impressions} and \co{moods}. Goingfar away, to an exotic and unfamiliar corner of the world, is naturallyaccompanied by an excitement and openness to the encounter with something -- asthe expectations go -- completely new. But after some time (perhaps a week,perhaps a year), when the storm of novelties and initial \co{impressions} hascalmed down, there arises a specific \co{mood} of something familiar in themidst of all this unfamiliarity.  One notices that, as a matter of fact, inspite of all the differences and novelties, one has not traveled that far. Evenif the mood of the life \thi{out there} is very different from that at home, themood of my life seems to be only slightly affected by it and, at the bottom,remained the same. Variation of lower \co{moods} and \co{impressions} uncoversoften deeper \co{qualities}. In general, they need not be so \co{visible}.  Theyare constant themes which remain unthematic but are \co{experienced} as if inthe background of \co{actual} situations, as mere modifiers of the particular\co{moods} and \co{impressions}. Laughter of a happy man is different from thelaughter of a desperate man. Being the \co{qualities} of {\em life}, they have noparticular object but embrace all objects.%\paHaving no particular objects, they may be \co{clear} and \co{recognisable}, butare certainly \co{vague} and hardly definable.  This undefinable \co{vagueness},this lack of any \co{objective} correlates gives them a calm character.Even if the \co{actual} feelings expressing the \co{quality of life} arerestless and confused, the \co{quality} itself is not so. Because it is \co{experienced} as given -- not in the sense of \co{actual}givenness of an \co{object}, but in the sense of givenness of something which isgreater than any particular \co{object} and situation, which is greater thanwhat can be controlled and influenced at the moment. Even if encountered in aparticular situation, it is not limited to this situation, it does not aimat any \co{action} or expression -- it merely dawns on me. To the extent the\co{quality} has a negative character, it is experienced with resignation orwish that it be different. If it has a positive character, the same kind ofcalmness becomes a thankful acceptance.  Any possible reactions, whether suddenoutbursts, protests or satisfaction, are at most \co{actual} expressions motivated bysuch underlying feelings but not their proper \co{signs}. Calm reaction can expresscertainty or resignation, laughter can express acceptance or contempt, almostany \co{actual mood} and reaction can be associated with various deeper feelingsand, eventually, \co{qualities}. And it is only this deeper association, thisundefinable \co{rest}, which, on the one hand, modifies the \co{actual signs} sothat one's laughter is unmistakably distinct from another's and, on the otherhand, gives the \co{actual signs} their more profound meaning reaching beyondthe mere \co{horizon of actualities}.\pa Most abstractly, the \co{qualities} might be divided into feelings ofspiritual\ftnt{The word \wo{soulful} would seem more appropriate here if it did  not carry all too emotional connotations.} gratification, peace, on the onehand, and sadness, mourning, on the other.  To most people the \co{quality of  life} makes it worth living, but to some it does not. The immediate, \os\ ofthe former is the simple fact that one does continue living, of the latter --suicide.  But these are abstractions. Every person, every life has its unique\co{quality} and it is only up to \co{reflection} to decide how far it wants toabstract or distinguish, what it wants to consider as analogies and what asdifferences.  Every man carries with him the \co{quality of his life} which canbe sensed and experienced (even if not contained in a precise concept) byhimself and by others. There are people whose life {\em is} light or shallow,and whose life {\em is} sad or tragic. The \co{quality of life} of IvanKaramazov, sharply independent, confusedly intellectual is something verydifferent from the peacefully submissive, warmly open \co{quality of life} ofAlosha. Their thirst and search have quite different \co{qualities}, even if,perhaps, both \co{thirst} eventually for the same.\noo{ Two persons can be  equally stupid, comparably eloquent, may have similar laughter, etc., etc.,  but all these similarities do not change the fact that one laughs in his own  way which, in fact, is not the way of the other, that every single thing done  by the one obtains different character than it would if done by the other.  }Every person has, besides recognisable and repeatable features, besides somecharacter traits which can be shared with others, \co{above} all that which canever be captured by the \co{actual} look, something -- \fre{je ne sais quoi} --which gives all these features a uniquely personal touch.  \noo{A good  psychologist should not perhaps notice that, but every human being should.}\noo{Empiricists would say that it is only a unique combination of the common  traits and, certainly, the \co{quality} may be to some extent influenced by  the course of life and choices one makes in it. But }Unlike vital feelings, \co{qualities of life} are not \co{actual} expressions ofanimated, alive energy, and not even of life in general, but of \co{my} life.Life in general may have all kinds of alternative qualities; it may be tragic{\em or} comic, meaningful {\em or} wasted, hard {\em or} easy, intense {\em or}peaceful.  One's life, too, can have different qualities for which we needdifferent words, but to the extent these signify the \co{quality} of one life,they are joined not by \thi{or} but by \thi{and}. One's life can be bothtragic {\em and} comic, but then this conjunction, as well as the particularways of its manifestations express, or rather only try to express, this particular and unique \co{quality}. The whole \co{concreteness} of the\co{quality} lies here in this \thi{and}, in the peculiar way itconnects the descriptions which, when applied to the \co{actual objects}, wouldappear contrary. \ad{Reflective signs} Verbal statements of such qualities involve already a\co{reflective} attitude.  Very roughly and approximately, they are preceded by\wo{I am\ldots} rather than \wo{I feel\ldots} \wo{I feel nice} suggests asituated context in which this feeling arises. We do not say \wo{I am nice} inthe same sense.  \wo{I feel dissatisfaction}, too, refers implicitly to adissatisfying situation. \wo{I am dissatisfied} may be said in the same sense,but it may also be said in the broader sense of \wo{My life is dissatisfying}.The statements like \wo{Life is difficult/restless/meaningless/etc.}, or else\wo{Life is peaceful, even though each day is a struggle.} are usually made inresponse to particular circumstances, in a specific context of paternalisticadvice to a child or an intimate complain to a close friend. They thuspresuppose a particular frame of mind, a particular mood and, often, a\co{reflective} attitude.  But these are only possible conditions for actually{\em making} such statements. The statements themselves are incomplete andimperfect expressions of the \co{qualities} -- the \co{reflective signs} of the\co{experienced} \co{quality} of \co{my} life.We are not concerned with the {\em truth} of such statements. They are nevertrue in the strict, objectivistic sense. And yet, they do witness to\co{experiences} of a different order than the \co{experiences} of\co{complexes}, they witness to feelings of different kind than \co{moods} and\co{impressions}.  One can claim that such statements are merely generalisationsfrom a series of \co{experiences} and express nothing more than their commonfeatures. Yet, if one wants to maintain this empiristic view, one should alsoexplain what the supposed subject of all these predicates is and whatconstitutes the need for such useless judgments. In fact, the statements areneither meaningless nor useless. Their meaning is grounded in \co{the  experience} of one's life and even if they do not express \co{precise}content, they can communicate the intended \co{qualities}, they can beunderstood by a sympathy which need not \co{conceptual precision} but onlysufficient indications.Mere words  are  never sufficient to communicate the\co{quality of life}.  Typically, one has to tell a story, perhaps a long story,and certainly a whole-hearted story, in order to communicate verbally the\co{quality of one's life}.  But the \co{quality} itself, the {emotion} {\em is}\co{experienced} by everybody, even if one usually lacks words for expressing itunequivocally and borrows the words designating primarily \co{moods} and\co{impressions}.  And it is precisely the very fact that such verbalexpressions are always given with the {\em accompanying awareness} of theirinsufficiency and inadequacy, which suggests the \co{unity} of the underlyingexperience. The experience of the words being insufficient for the expression ofthe \co{quality of life} is also the experience of the \co{unity} of life whichsimply \co{transcends} any \co{actual} expressions.\noo{Such a \co{reflection} can be provoked, for instance, by what one calls \wo{the  transiency of the world}, the fact which displays its temporality.  It takestime before one encounters such experiences. As long as the world of a child isstable, there is nothing provoking its reflection to focus on this fact ofstability. The stability is \co{experienced}, i.e., a child living in apeaceful, stable world does have the experience of this stability. But this doesnot mean that the child experiences the world {\em as} stable, i.e., it does notnecessarily have a \co{reflective experience} of it.  A major change in thisworld, a loss, moving to another place may be the first \co{signs} reflectingthe transiency of the world.  And such an experience reveals -- to my\co{experience} and possibly reflection -- \co{that I am}.Often, such \co{an experience} occurs in adolescence, when one for the first time, with unexpected clarity realises one's presence. Jung describes himself, at about the age of twelve, having such \co{an experience} realising that \citt{now I am {\em myself}! [\ldots] Previously [\ldots] everything had merely happened to me [\ldots] now {\em I} willed.}{Jung, {\em Memories, Dreams, Reflections}, pp.32}}\pa The \rss\ of the experience \co{that I am} are \co{general thoughts} settingup a distinction, often an opposition, between \co{myself} and \co{the world}.These are no longer mere \co{concepts} summarising the properties of this orthat and the relations of this to that, but unverifiable, \co{general thoughts}about the character of the world, on the one hand, and the \co{quality} of life,on the other.  The distinction \co{posited} by \co{reflection} between the worldand one's life is, in fact, only an artificial extension of the\co{subject}-\co{object} dualism to the \co{posited totality}. The propertiesascribed to the world happen to reflect only the \co{quality} of {my life} andvice versa.  Saying something like \citet{All the world's a stage,\lin And all  the men and women merely players}{AsYouLikeIt}{II:7 (Jaques)} or \citet{This  world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange\lin That even our loves should with  our fortunes change;}{Hamlet}{III:2 (Player King)} one seems to characterisethe world, but this is only a matter of grammar. One actually states somethingabout the life in the world, about the \co{quality} of life.  Certainly, onedoes not state any true fact, even less a fact which could be verified. But onedoes not make any false statement, either -- one expresses \co{general thoughts}about the \co{quality of life}.Discussing \co{actual} matters -- the current political situation in~\ldots, therecent fashion in literary criticism, the choice of furniture, the events atwork~\ldots -- one can pretend to remain half-anonymous, to keep an\thi{objective} distance to the matter at hand which, in fact, is depersonalisedand external. But the more general statements one makes, characterising thetotality of the world and the workings of human life and affairs, the lesspossibility to retain the distance and the more one unveils \co{oneself}.\label{pa:worldislife2}Making a statement about the world or life in general, I am bound to unveil\co{myself}. Saying \wo{The world is cruel and hostile.}  I make so much an\thi{objective} statement about the course of the world as about my\thi{subjective} experience of the world. The obvious, immediate conclusionfollowing such a statement could be something like \wo{One has to watch onesteps not to be trapped by the world's (other people's) hostile schemes\ldots} Theformer involves and unveils (if not logically implies) the latter. And in thesame way, a suspicious \wo{I am always careful in all my dealings to avoid\ldots}implies something about the understanding of the world.  The first, apparentlyparadoxical, moment of the medieval \la{memento mori} is to direct the attentionto {\em one's} life. But this turn is to be done against the understanding ofthe limited and passing value of the things of \co{this world}. The universaldoubt recommended by Descartes is so much an expression of a shrewd, suspiciousintellect, as of the understanding of the world which -- who knows? -- might beunder a spell of the \thi{Evil Spirit}. We do not know, but its mere possibilitymakes the world untrustworthy.\label{pa:worldislife3} \co{Qualities of life}, the \co{original signs} of\co{mineness} do not necessarily involve the clear split into \co{the world} onthe one hand and \co{myself} on the other.  Although \co{reflection} will easilydistinguish \co{myself} from my world, the \co{general thoughts}, too, tell oneas much about the world as about the speaker.  The more \wo{general} issues oneaddresses, the more of oneself one has to unveil.  \citet{He who says \thi{life    is real, life is earnest}, however much he may speak of the fundamental  mysteriousness of things, gives a distinct definition of this mysteriousness  by ascribing to it the right to claim from us the particular mood called  seriousness -- which means willingness to live with energy, though energy  bring pain.  The same is true of him who says that all is vanity.  For  indefinable as the predicate \thi{vanity} may be \la{in se}, it is clearly  something that permits anaesthesia, mere escape from suffering, to be our rule  of life.}{Pragm}{I;p.19}Statements \wo{Life is\ldots}, \wo{The world is\ldots}  and \wo{My life is\ldots} donot only appear \co{conceptually} equally empty (in spite of all the existentialcontent they carry), they are equipotent, they say the same about the same.They can be supported by various arguments and examples, can be related to otherthoughts, elaborated \la{ad nauseam} over a glass of beer or whiskey (and anotherglass, and another\ldots)  Eventually, they tell you nothing about the world orlife in general, but only about a {\em possible} \co{experience} of world andlife -- i.e., about the person making this statement and {\em his}\co{experience} of {life}.\citet{The world of the happy man is a different one from that of the unhappy  man.}{Tract}{6.43}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\noo{\paIf needed, we will use the word \wo{\co{ideas}} to refer jointly to the \rss\ and \oss\ of the level of \co{mineness}. This word may indicate something `one gets', like when onesays \wo{He has got this idea about life}, without having deliberately chosen it. \co{Ideas} are notentirely under our conceptual control, they rather reflect the quality ofour experience; eventually, they cast the shadow on our \co{actual} \co{thoughts} and \co{moods}. Obviously, there is close to nothing these \co{ideas} have in common with thoseof Plato.  There is, however, an analogy with Kantian use of the term, in that\co{ideas} are \co{signs} of inexhaustible potential of life.  An \co{idea} isnever adequate, a \co{general thought} can always be mocked as a failedgeneralisation. It merely suggests but never captures the whole it signifies.That is, it never captures it in a precise, conceptual form.  But it can alwayshappen to communicate the intended \co{quality} to a person who is open for sucha communication, who has similar enough \co{experience} or, at least, is willingto ignore imprecision of the \co{signs} in order to \co{recognise} the\co{experience} they try to convey.}\subsub{{This world}}\label{sec:thisWorld}\pa We must admit that the \co{totality} of all things of \co{this world} isnever given in \co{an actual experience}. But the conclusion that there is nosuch unity as \co{this world} follows then only if one has reduced reality to\co{actual experiences}.  If nothing more then, at least, our inability to giveup the mode of speaking involving such general judgments about the world or lifesuggests that there may be some \co{experienced unity} which transcends thedistinctions made within it. We do not look for proofs and merely claim the\co{presence} of such a \co{unity}. There are \co{totalities} which arereducible to their constituents, which are only sums of their parts. \co{This  world}, however, is not such a \co{totality}.\ftnt{In fact, we would not even  know what the supposed parts are. The interested ones may follow the interminable  discussions trying to decide whether these are things, facts, matters at hand,  states of affairs\ldots We, of course, won't.}  If it can be \co{posited} as one\co{totality}, it is only because there is already \co{experienced unity}, whichonly calls for some \co{actual} expression or, in more obsessive case, anexplanation.  Like any unity which \co{transcends} some \co{complex} ofdistinctions, this \co{unity} which is not reducible to the \co{totality} ofthings is more primordial than their \co{posited totality}.\ftnt{In general,  \co{unity founds totality} and such a \co{founding unity transcends} the  respective \co{totality}. In particular, \co{the world} \co{transcends} the  multiplicity of \thi{things within the world}.%Heidegger's Being transcends multiplicity of beings. But \co{the world} %is not Heidegger's Being.  \citef{That which in any multiplicity is unitary did not flow out of any of    its elements, that which is unitary in [common to] all cannot come from one    among all but remains characteristic property of that unitary    one.}{Proclus}{\para21} It is like Cusanus' universe of \thi{all things}  which, however \citef{are not \thi{many things}, since plurality does not    precede each thing.

In both of these ways of    access to \thi{Objective Being}, the \thi{world} has already been    \thi{presupposed}, and indeed in various ways.}{SuZ}{I:3.14 [H64]}} In somestrange way, phenomenologists managed to coin the phrase \wo{phenomenon of the  world}. But \co{the world} is not a phenomenon; it does not appear in the unityof a single \co{act} of consciousness. What appears in such acts is an emptyword, a \co{vague} idea of something close to void of any content, a mere\co{sign} pointing towards some all-embracing container. True, the \co{sign} isnot entirely void and this is why one feels justified in analysing the assumed\thi{phenomenon}. But such an analysis concerns only series of distinct,\co{actual} phenomena.  Their \co{unity} has no phenomenal content.  Thedivergent analyses of the supposed phenomenon among various phenomenologistsillustrate not only the failure of making \co{the world} into a correlate ofadequate intuition, but also the general fact of irreducibility of its\co{transcendent unity} to the \co{actuality} of features, facts, things andobservations.\pa Since we do not need adequate intuition nor exhaustive characterisations, weshould be allowed to say that \co{this world} is the givenness of the\co{visible}, givenness not merely as an \co{immediate actuality} but as thefield of one's activities, passions, goals, in short, the field of one's life.It does contain {things}, tools, situations, concepts but this is just ananalytical statement -- all these are just the \co{cuts from experience}circumscribed within the \hoa.  \co{This world} is the horizon of\co{visibility} within which everything \co{actual} appears.  TheHusserlian notion of a \thi{horizon} has much intuitive appeal and it should notbe taken as merely something surrounding \co{visible} things. It is somethingfrom which all \co{visible} things emerge. We could say, it is the\co{visibility} itself. If we were to use the language we have given up: it isnot an accidental \co{totality} (\co{totality} is, in fact, always somewhataccidental) of \co{dissociated} \thi{substances} but, on the contrary, it is the\thi{substance} of which all particular things are accidents.Rephrasing this last paragraph: \co{this world} emerges as the third hypostasis(I:\ref{se:begWord}), as \co{chaos} turned into \co{re-cognisable}\co{experience}. \co{This world} precedes all the things which we later findwithin it. And it does so not only ontologically but also epistemologically.(For, as a matter of fact, the generative order of \co{founding} coincides withthe ontological order and, with respect to the most fundamental notions andentities, also with the epistemological order: what emerges first, is also whatis most intimately \co{experienced}.)\co{The world} considered from the present level bears a resemblance to\thi{Lebenswelt} in that it manifests itself phenomenally only as the idealhorizon of the contents appearing within it and, consequently, as the field ofour activity and life.  One has a strong tendency to see it only as a\co{totality} of things rather than as a \co{unity} of its own because\co{reflective experience} is unable to grasp this \co{unity} in the\co{actuality} of a single \co{act}: \co{the world} is not an \co{object} of\co{an experience}.  But \co{the world} manifests itself in \co{any experience},not as its thematic \co{object}, but as the constant \co{aspect} which actuallyconnects all \co{actual experiences}, which is the same, constant field of theirunfolding.  In every experience, it is \ger{mitgegeben} but only as a kind ofnoumenal unity, as an indication of the \co{presence} of the totality of thingsof \co{experience}; not as a concrete \thi{horizon} of related things, butrather as a mere background, the ground on which the \co{actual experience}finds place.  In this sense, \co{the world} is indeed in each thing, is\co{reflected} in every experience. But its \co{unity} precedes all these\co{experiences}, it is not \co{founded} by them but by the respectivehypostasis which is beyond phenomenological grasp.\ftnt{\citef{But since the    universe is in each [thing] in such a way that each is in it, in each thing    the universe is in a contracted way that which this thing is contractedly,    and in the universe each thing is in the universe, although the universe is    in each thing in one way, and each thing is in universe in a different way.    [...]  Indeed, in a stone all things are stone; in a vegetative soul all are    vegetative soul; in life all are life; in the senses all are senses; in    sight all are sight; in hearing all are hearing; in imagination all are    imagination; in reason all are reason [...]}{DDI}{II:5/118}}\subsub{{I}}\label{sec:I}\pa\label{lev:I} %!!! used later\co{Self-reflection}, \co{reflection} \co{that I am}, is an \co{act} which,attempting to \co{actualise} its intention, is always aware of itsinsufficiency.

But the question never finds an adequate answer. One would like to know: Iam (going to be) a carpenter, a family man, a dedicated father, a scientist, apolitician, a charmer,\ldots Or else: I am intelligent, I am pretty, I am weak, I amtoo vulnerable,\dots One would like to get an answer in terms of \co{actual,  reflective} categories but such an answer would amount to reducing \co{oneself} toone's \co{ego}. The only answer is that \co{I am myself}, but to understand andaccept it one has first to live, transcend one's \co{egotism} -- for the mere\co{reflective} thirst for plain \co{visibility} it is empty and disappointing.  The question never finds an adequate answer because one has a multiplicity of\co{egos}, none of which nor the \co{totality} of which exhaust \co{oneself}. The relation between \co{oneself} and one's \co{egos} can be compared to that between the residual correlate obtained in the process ofvariation (like eidetic reduction, only varying the whole life) in which thevaried elements are \co{egos}. There are, for instance, persons with strongskills for social adaptation, perhaps actor-like characters, who behavingdifferently on different occasions, do not suffer from any identity crises; orelse, \thi{rich personalities} with a wide range of forms of expressionwhich may easily seem incongruent but which are underlied some higher form ofpersonal coherence and control. In fact, every person has a similar multiplicity of \co{egos}, or\thi{persona}: one for work, one for home, another for friends at one's placeand another for friends at their place, one for children, another for aparty,\ldots Strength of a personality is much closer related to the wide span ofapparently incongruent \co{egos} the person possesses and controls, than to theuniformity of one's \co{egos} across different contexts and situations.%sick:\pa\label{pa:egoDID} On the other hand, the multiplicity of \co{egos} is alsowhat makes personal disintegration possible.  The question which an ideal theoryof a simple, \thi{substantial}, \thi{atomic} \co{subjectivity} must answer innegative is: \wo{Is the disintegration of personal identity, the loss of one'sconsistency and continuity possible?}  In the \co{immediacy} of pure\co{subjectivity} such a loss is impossible -- there is no {\em time} for it!But identification of the subject, of the \co{unity} of human being with the\co{immediate consciousness} is of little help because, as we well know, such adisintegration is possible. It is possible because \co{I}, being stretched intime, can lose the continuity in time -- \co{I} can be \co{dissociated} into amultiplicity of \co{egos}.Dissociative identity disorder, \abr{did}, shows that one can possess amultiplicity of \co{egos}, each of which is sufficiently integrated to have arelatively stable life of its own and recurrently to take full control of theperson's behavior.\ftnt{Milder forms of dissociative or organic amnesia, fugue  states (flight from one's identity, frequent in war victims) can be mentioned  here as well, even though some psychologists challenge the reasons for  identifying -- if not the very reality of -- such disorders. \abr{did} used  also to be called \wo{multiple personality disorder}. We do not see much of  personality in the \co{complexes} affected by such disorders -- they seem to  coincide with our \co{ego}.}  Differences between various \co{egos} of oneperson may be astonishing -- amnesia of other \co{egos}, changed wishes,attitudes, interests, hand writing, even different physiological indices likeheart rate, blood pressure, \abr{eeg}.\ftn{\citeauthor*{Lester}} A personsuffering from \abr{did} has, as a normal person, a multiplicity of possessions,namely \co{egos}. The difference is that, while a healthy person possesses\co{egos} keeping them under some degree of control, with a sick person it is\co{egos} which gain uncanny autonomy and possess the person. The relationbetween \co{I} and \co{egos} gets inverted, \co{I} is conflated to the level of\co{egos} and, unable to organise them, suffers their multiplicity -- the higherbecomes a mere \co{totality} of the lower.\pa\label{pa:iDID} It is easy to misuse such examples to suggest that \thi{in  reality} there is no \co{I} and only a multiplicity of somethings, e.g.,\co{egos}. But the fact that we can demolish a building into a heap of bricksproves neither the unreality of the building nor that it is, \thi{in reality},only a heap of bricks. Phenomena like \abr{did} represent disintegration andnot, for instance, simple multiplication. As a disintegration, it is possiblebecause subject (person, man) is not any ideal and extensionless point, butbecause in its temporal duration it possesses \co{complex} aspects whoseconfigurations may change.  But there is more than the mere disintegration.  Itchanges certainly the feeling of life and the sense of oneself, but it does notchange the fact that even such a person is \co{oneself} all the time.  Each ofthe \co{egos} has only a \wo{{\em relatively} stable life of its own}.  Whilepsychologists focus on what constitutes the problem -- the dissociation of the{\em sense of} identity -- one should not forget all the rest -- the \co{unity}prevailing \co{above} the \co{actual} multiplicity.  For instance, usually thereis one dominant personality (who `knows' about others), and one can often changeat will from one to another, through a process similar to self-hypnosis(\abr{did} patients are highly hypnotisable and susceptible to self-hypnosis).It is the person \co{himself} who starts spawning new \co{egos} to handle someunbearable emotional problems (child abuse is the recurring theme in theetiology of \abr{did}, the first alter \co{ego} appears usually between the 4thand 6th year of life); it is the person himself who still keeps some degree ofcontinuity;\ftnt{In the well-known Julie-Jenny-Jerrie case, Jerrie says: \wo{I    wish Julie would stop smoking. I hate the taste of tobacco.} The split is  there, but it is obviously maintained by somebody.  Jerrie knows about Julie  while Jenny, the original \co{ego}, knows about both other.} it is the person\co{himself} who addresses the therapist; and most importantly, it is the person\co{himself} who is being treated and, as the case may be, cured. A successfultreatment of \abr{did} results in an integration of multiple \co{egos}: ineither merging or associating them in the \co{unity} of one person. It is notthe multiplicity of \co{egos} which got cured -- it is {\em the} person.\wtsep{3. world = I; only abstractly dissociated}\pa \co{Reflection dissociates} and \co{posits I} against -- as opposed to,thrown into, confronted with -- a foreign world.  The \co{I} revealed to\co{self-reflection} is not explicable in the way \co{ego} might be. It is not\co{transcendent} in the way \co{ego} is, merged with the world and its\co{visible}, even if \co{unclear} affairs. \co{I} is something other, somethingbeyond and above the world, something~\ldots noumenal.  It does not belong thereamong things and \co{complexes}, it does not belong among others who, for themoment, are just foreigners. The pure \co{I} of the \co{reflection that I am}is, as Camus would repeat after so many others, a stranger.  The strangeness is,however, only in the \co{externalised objects} and, likewise, in their\co{posited totality}. {\em This} is indeed the kind of world in which \co{soul}is a stranger, the world viewed by the abstract \co{reflection} as a mere\co{totality} of things, of \co{dissociated} situations, eventually, ofirrational and meaningless, even if logically comprehensible, events.\co{Concretely}, however, (and that means, without attempts at reduction tothe \co{visibility} of \co{actual} givens) \co{self-reflection} marks the\co{experience} of one's life.  We have purposefully not distinguished betweenthe \co{qualities of life} and the feelings thereof. We would be tempted toidentify them.\ftnt{But identify -- not reduce the \co{qualities} to merefeelings!  \co{Qualities} are not only \thi{subjective feelings}. Rather, bothare alternative, hardly distinguishable \co{aspects} of the same personal\nexus.}\noo{\co{I} am not given {my life} as a substance, an \co{object}which then can be attributed different \co{qualities}.} The feeling of {my life}is the same as the feeling of its \co{quality}, and only \co{reflection} tendsto \co{dissociate} the two. I do not experience some feelings which then can beidentified as revealing some \co{qualities}. They are the same thing, and we\co{dissociate} them only by \co{externalising} the \co{qualities} as some\co{objects} distinct from the \co{signs}, the feelings through which theyappear.{One's life} not only exceeds the \hoa, but also remains forever, {\emessentially}, outside it, always richer, always inexhaustible.  Seen this way,the richness of {one's life} is a counterpart of the noumenal emptiness of thebare, self-identical \co{I}.  \noo{All \co{signs} of this level point to\co{myself} and manifest shallower or deeper appearances of mineness.  I maydiscover dark and unexpected sides of myself, but they are all intimately {\emmy} sides, they are not, in any way, alien.}  Experience of \co{myself} isequiprimordial with the \co{experience} of {my life}.  One tends to think thelatter as an accident of the former but this is because the former has stilldeeper roots to which we will return shortly.  {My life} is not something which\co{I} of \co{self-reflection} has, it is something it is.\co{I} do not live my life -- \co{I} am \co{my} life. %\pa\noo{No matter what typography one attempts of human personalities, types, etc.,one is always left with the concepts which shine with their emptiness, all theirpossible honesty and adequacy notwithstanding. \co{Concreteness} of life slipsbetween the fat fingers of \co{conceptual} constructions.  Neither can any lifebe contained in a book, be it a most detailed biography, even if much of it canbe captured by an adequate description and some essential traces expressedsuccessfully by a talented artist.  But to contain a life would be to strip itof its \co{concrete} \co{quality}, to reduce it by repeating it.} \label{pa:worldislife1}To use yet another word, we can say that the richness of {one's life} is one's\co{soul}.  One can build {one's life} on an example of a person one respects,develop one's soul inspired by another, learn something from another's life.But one \co{soul}, the uniqueness of one life and its \co{quality} can not berepeated.  There is nothing like \thi{{\em a} soul}.  Soul is always\co{concrete}, it is always {this particular life}, this concrete {world}.\co{Soul} is not alive, it is life.  And it is life because it is \co{the world}and \co{the world} is life.  One's \co{soul}, \co{oneself} becomes emptied oflife to the extent it is \co{posited} by \co{reflection} as an independententity, an isolated being only potentially capable of an involvement in an alienworld.  \ger{Dasein} which \thi{falls within the world} is a gnostic abstraction-- even if some feelings in the face of dissolving values and depersonalisedworld could be described this way it is, eventually, a harmful \co{sign} of\co{alienation}.  The \co{quality of life} is the \co{quality} of the \co{soul}and is the \co{quality} of its world -- the three can be \co{dissociated} onlyby \co{reflective} abstraction. \co{The world} understood as the continuity of\co{experience}, as the \co{unity} preceding, and hence stretching beyond itstemporal differentiation into the \co{dissociated objects}, is the same as {my  life}, is intimately \co{my} world.  \citet{The world and life are one.

Good {soul} cannot live in anevil world, for no matter to how much evil \co{the world} exposes the soul, thegood soul will still see -- in \co{the world} -- the reason to be good.  To begood {\em in spite of the evil} in \co{the world} is to assume an attitudewhich, at some point, does not reflect one's being. To be good in \co{the world}which is evil is to be a rigid moralist, a pharisee or, in a more lofty variant,a resigned Stoic who is only a tiny step from the apathy of a boredintellectual, gnawed by the \thi{unreality} of his lofty \thi{ideas and ideals}.To be good is not only being good but also finding goodness, finding the needand reason for it not only in the self-goodness of one's inner life but in\co{the world}. \woo{A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth  forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth  evil things.}{Mt.XII:35; Lk. VI:45} But \thi{the treasure of the heart} isnot any private \thi{subjectivity} of one's \thi{inner life}.  \citeti{For where  your treasure is, there will your heart be also.}{Mt.}{XII:35/VI:21; Lk.  VI:45/XII:34} The \thi{treasure} is something found, given to \co{me} from\co{above} and not something \co{I} assume or decide to value.  This\thi{treasure} is that which shapes \co{my} heart, \co{my soul}, while its lackleaves the \co{soul} empty.\pa Wanting to change {one's life}, not only this or that aspect of it but\co{oneself}, one has to change the \co{world}.  One's life acquires a new\co{quality} not because one has realised something important in a momentaneousillumination but as a consequence of a new way of \co{experiencing  the world}, of finding a new \thi{treasure}.  Certainly, there arepathological cases against which a mere analysis, psychoanalysis or otherform of psychotherapy can help.  But their value is limited to the lower levels of\co{egotic} disturbances.  The faith in their unlimited power can arise onlyfrom the assumption of the genuine \co{dissociation} of a person from \co{his  world}, according to which each can be \thi{treated} independently from theother.\ftnt{Many examples of the resulting oppositions can be found in the  society of Victorian \fre{fin de sicle}: positivistic scientism and  utilitarianism are nervously opposed by the search for the freedom of the will  and the calls to cultivate \thi{art for art's sake}; bourgeois norms and  industrial routine is equally nervously opposed by the cult of intense  experience, hashish, absinthe and Bohemian decadence; neurasthenic apathy and  weary reflection call for passionate and heroic action; the progressing  depersonalisation and society turning into masses, if not mob, are met with  almost pietistic calls to personal concentration and authenticity.  Baudelaire, Mallarm\'{e}, Wilde, Freud, Nietzsche, Spencer, Dostoevsky, James  \ldots It is hard to avoid \noo{fend-keep off}the sense of artificiality -- if  not of the view of the world and of the involved oppositions, then of the  individual attitude attempted {\em in spite of} and against the world (or was  it in spite of and against \co{oneself}?)  Much of the XX-th century's so  called \wo{existentialism} sailed under the same banner.}  Healing a truesuffering of a \co{soul} amounts to healing \co{the world} of this \co{soul}for, in deeper respects, one can hardly change understanding of the worldwithout actually \co{experiencing} a changed world.  Sometimes, a travel to aremote place may be needed to regenerate the \co{soul}.  An emotional impairmentresulting from the lack of love and warmth can hardly be changed by a mererealisation that this was its cause.  It may need not only the will to change itbut also the very \co{experience} of love and warmth.  This is what often makesmeeting new people worthwhile: they can make things which seemed impossible,even non-existent, to appear obvious and natural.  They can show us a differentworld which cures the lacks of the world in which we used to live.% \wtsep{activity: changing the world = changing oneself}\pa\label{pa:Zweck} \co{My} life, that is, \co{the world}, is the field of\co{my} expression.  Its unlimited -- though finite -- temporal (and spatial)scope is no longer a stage of single \co{acts} or manipulative \co{actions} butof \co{activity} in the broadest sense of the word, \co{activity} which is notmerely a sum of \co{acts} and \co{actions}, which is not directed towardsachievement of some goals, but which expresses the \co{traces} of values, the\co{motives} which shape the horizon for selecting possible goals.\ftnt{Using  the distinction of Scheler's, a specific goal corresponds to \thi{Zweck}, a  \co{motivation} to \thi{Ziel}, e.g., \citeauthor*{MaxForm}{I:I.3.\kilde{p.52}}  \co{Motivation} is a horizon of values which, on the one hand, functions as  the \co{foundation} for choosing particular goals and, on the other hand,  becomes \co{actualised} through their realisation -- it comes both before and  after the goals, it surrounds them.} {My life} is just that -- the way I spendmy time.  A common answer to the question \wo{Who is he?} would simply tell whatthe person is doing for living.  A profession tells something precisely aboutthat: what one does with one's time, or even better, to what one dedicates one'stime.  A (deliberate) choice of profession may involve detailed arguments aboutspecific demands and forms of activity associated with it.  But it alwaysinvolves more, a hardly expressible feeling of the \co{quality}, of thecharacter of the profession, which should correspond to the feelings of one'svalues and the sense of what is meaningful.  One wants one's \co{activities} toreflect the (passive) feelings of \co{qualities} and values.  (Of course,profession is hardly ever an exhaustive characterisation -- one may actuallyhate one's work and devote much more and more intense time to other,non-professional \co{activities}.)  The \co{activity} to which one devotes muchof one's time, expresses also the \co{quality} of one's life.  And it is nolonger talk about simple grasping-avoiding as in the case of \co{objects}, norarranging-preventing as in the case of \co{complexes}, but about dedication,about accepting some values \co{transcending} the \co{actuality} and aboutdedicating one's life to their expression.\pa Not only changing one's life involves changing \co{the world} but also viceversa.  If one wants to change \co{the world}, that is, not this or that thingbut \co{the world}, one has to bring to it a changed \co{quality} of one's life.Achievements, deeds, goals, reforms do change the {objective world}. But it isnever certain if they also will change \co{the world}. In most cases, they donot, and the more extreme changes of the world make only the remoteness ofsalvation more clear. \citet{How can an event which, like war, eliminates  discussion and opens every possibility by denying every norm, bring salvation  to humanity?}{Opium}{I:Concerning the political optimism\kilde{p.97}} How canit bring salvation even only to its perpetrators?  Revolution as a means ofabolishing alienation is one of the most tragic human inventions but it is onlyan extreme case of frustration turned into destruction of which there are manyexamples. With respect to the personal dimension of \co{existence}, socialactivism suffers from the insufficiency, if not irrelevancy, which broods even over the satisfaction from the \co{actual} successes.  No doubt, improving social institutions may be a venerable\co{activity}. But looking in it for the medicine against personal problems andchanged \co{quality} of one's life is, at best, a misunderstanding and, atworst, an instinctive resentment, the more dangerous because unchecked in itsconvictions about its beneficent intentions.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{MaxRess}{.}  The just quoted book of R.~Aron contains the classical analyses of a  particular form of this sickness.} It is true that living in a particularworld may promote some and not other ways of \co{experiencing} and only some,but not other \co{qualities of life}.  But these are, at best, statisticaltendencies. They never have a predictable effect on a particular individualwhose \co{world} is much more than the {objective world} of tools and political,economical and social organisation.\noo{Feeling that \co{I} do not know who I am, so nowadays popular confused \thi{looking for oneself}, is the same as the feeling of the \thi{unreality} of \co{the world}, both are just aspects of the same experience of alienation. accepting and giving. Give -- receive; care-expect; love-hate, (responsibility?)}\subsub{Transcendence}% fix a bit: what is really the vertical aspect?% horizontal -- the same level vs. vertical -- Aufhebung of this % level's categories ?\pa At the current level, one finds the distinction between the personal andimpersonal, but the distinction between the \thi{objective} and the\thi{subjective} loses almost completely its meaning.  It is \co{myself},\co{my} life which is involved, in a sense, the most \thi{subjective}\co{aspect} of experience. On the \thi{objective} side there is, perhaps, theworld, in the sense of \thi{everything but me}. But this phrase can signify hereonly the correlate of \co{my} life, the field of its unfolding.  \co{The world},{my life}, \co{experience} and \co{myself} are close to synonymous. To be sure, we do live in the {objective world}, we do make plans, manageworldly situations, use tools.  But all these \co{complexes} are correlates ofmy \co{ego}, they are only \thi{parts} of the world and are \co{below} me.Viewing \co{the world} as their \co{totality} is a simple-minded, and alwaysunsuccessful, reduction.  Things, \co{complexes}, particular situations andsingular \co{experiences} not only never exhaust the experience of \co{theworld} -- they do not even provide the ground for such \co{experience} which is\co{founded} upon the \co{unity transcending} their \co{totality},\co{transcending} the {objective world}.\pa The tension of \co{horizontal transcendence} at this level does not arisefrom the \co{more} of \co{complexes} but from the basic opposition between\co{mine} and \co{not-mine}.  It is immediately present in the \co{reflection  that I am} which performs a highly artificial operation of \co{dissociating  myself} from something -- from \co{the world}, perhaps, from {my life},apparently from that which is \co{not-mine} buteventually, as a matter of fact, from \co{myself}.  This \co{dissociation} findsan expression in the opposition between the \thi{inner} and the \thi{outer}, the \thi{inside} and the\thi{outside}.  \thi{Inner} would usually refer to the \thi{inner life} but itmay be related to anything which is in some way \co{experienced} as \co{mine}:\co{my} feelings, \co{my} things, \co{my} friends, \co{my} family.  The\thi{outer} is then everything else, everything excluded from this \thi{inner}circle, everything for which \co{I} do not feel a slightest degree ofresponsibility, everything which perhaps influences \co{me} but is not influenced by\co{me}.  The \co{transcendence} of that which is not \co{mine} may {confront me},for instance, as \co{my} indifference opposed to care and responsibility I feelfor what is \co{mine}. But it can also emerge through \co{my} inability todraw borders between the two, by \co{me} getting distracted, if not lost, amongthe challenges and temptations confronting me in my meeting with \co{the world},the inability \thi{to gather myself}.  When manifested in \co{actual signs}, itinvolves the fundamental feeling of being only \co{myself} confronted with therest which, being \co{not-mine}, is foreign, disturbing, unwelcome, eventhreatening and dangerous.%, whether it is as Plato's soul, Camus' stranger, or quite %personal feeling of hopelessness or alienation.\pa The \co{vertical aspect} of \co{transcendence} amounts here to aconfrontation with \co{chaos}. It is not, however, a mere chaos ofuncontrollable \co{complexity}, but a \co{chaos} in the face of which the categoriesof \co{visibility} simply lose their meaning. It is \thi{something completely  other}, something which can no longer be treated in the familiar waysaccording to which I organise \co{my world}.  This \co{chaos} may, but neednot, mean disorder -- it is only lack of \co{objective} order, lack of anysufficient reasons and explanations in the \co{objective} terms.The \co{horizontal transcendence} of \co{mineness} involves a feeling ofalienation, of being confronted with empty and meaningless, perhaps dangerousotherness of \co{not-mine}.  It is something foreign, but something from which Ican relatively easily retreat behind the walls of \co{my} home-castle.  The\co{vertical aspect} involves likewise a confrontation of \co{mine} and\co{not-mine}.  But unlike the former, it does not present \co{me} with adefinite, absolute \co{dissociation} of the two.  \co{Vertical transcendence}makes the \co{not-mine} \co{present} in a way which is, strangely yet\co{clearly}, intimately mine.  The \co{chaos} is \co{present} as a most genuineelement, as a most \co{immanent aspect} of \co{myself} and, by this very token,can be either a source from which \co{my activity} draws strength and energy, orelse an abyss capable of devouring \co{me}.Questions about the sense and meaning of one's life can be reduced to one's mainachievements, their importance for society or others, but typically they involveone in a confrontation with the fact that this meaning, if any, arises somewhere\co{above} and is not reducible to any plainly \co{visible} contents.Kierkegaard's \la{Angst} is a well known example of such \co{an experience}.  Itconfronts \co{me} with something totally other, something inexplicable andirreducible to the familiar categories of \co{visibility}; something whichthreatens \co{me} with its unfamiliarity and uncanniness. Such an encounteramounts, in fact, to the question about \co{myself}; manifesting irreducibleotherness, it oppugns the familiar categories and assumed foundations of \co{my}life, it poses the question about \co{myself}. But \la{Angst} is only an extremeexample.  Love which begins to penetrate my whole being without referring me toany specific object, which makes the whole world dissolve in a continuity ofthankfulness and inspiration can be a good example, too.  Love, also personallove, is not anything I arrange, even less anything I choose.  It is something Imeet, something coming to me from \co{above}, something \co{not-mine}. And yet,it does not remain a foreign and merely accidental event which only happened to\co{me} as is the case with \co{actual experiences}. Embracing my whole being,it is thoroughly \co{mine}, it involves \co{myself} to the very depth of my\co{soul}, to the point where \co{I} cease to be \co{myself}.The \co{vertical aspect} of \co{transcendence} confronts one with otherness\co{above}, with something over which one is not the master. It has these twobasic forms: of dissolution or enrichment, of destruction or creation.\citet{And of madness there [are] two kinds; one produced by human infirmity,  the other [is] a divine release of the soul from the yoke of custom and  convention.}{Phaedrus}{265b.\kilde{p.82;???} It is easy to observe  differences.  For instance, Plato's divine madness is \wo{subdivided into four    kinds, prophetic, initiatory, poetic, erotic}, all related to some  \co{actual} consequences (and reappearing later, with  Ficino\kilde{Commentarium in Convivium Platonis, VII:14;letter to Pellergino    Agli, in Opera} and Pico, as the four divine \la{furors}). But we need not  agree on all particulars to retain the main idea.} Only at the limits of{oneself} can one become \co{oneself}, but it is also where one can lose\co{oneself}. There is an element of madness in every creative genius, forcreation -- the secondary creation, that of which humans are capable -- amountsto organising the disorganised, to bringing \co{experience} out of \co{chaos}.Any creative \co{activity} involves a deep personal engagement which arises onlyfrom a confrontation with \co{chaos}, where \co{I} meets \co{non-I} and theborder between oneself and otherness, between \co{mine} and \co{not-mine} isimpossible to draw.  Such a confrontation may result in a dedicated love, in aresolute patience, in new, beautiful works of art or science or in \ldotsmadness.  A creative genius organises \co{chaos} emerging, like Jonas, afterthree days from the whale's belly.

It isthe level at which I can still choose and control and where all my decisions,actions and activities are referred back to \co{myself} as their protagonist.Even when I feel that, as a matter of fact, I am not in control, I still persistin the attempts to realise \co{my will}.  And as long as I persist in thisfocusing on \co{mineness}, \co{my} goals, \co{my} wishes, \co{my will}, I alsokeep experiencing \co{separation} as alienation.

As much as \co{I} knowthat \co{I} am \co{myself}, I also know that the reflecting \co{I} is not fully\co{myself}; the \co{I} grasped by the \co{reflective act} does not coincidewith \co{myself} living \co{my life}; \co{I} am \co{myself} and yet \co{I} amlosing myself, \co{I} am close to \co{myself}, but also remote -- the same anddifferent. \co{Alienation} is more than the estrangement from \co{the world}; itis first of all the estrangement from myself, the loss of contact with \co{my  self}.\pa There are situations where my self-identity, \co{posited} noumenally in\co{self-reflection} as an incomprehensibly substantial property, becomesdubious and as if suspended, if not totally absent.On the pathological end, many cases of schizophrenia provide examples of a splitat the level of \co{myself}.\ftnt{We use the term in the usually imprecise sense  which may cover a large variety of symptoms and their complexes, which should,  perhaps, be classified as distinct disorders.} The etymology of the termcoined by Eugene Bleuler -- \la{schizo} = split, \la{phreno} = mind -- does notintend multiple personalities but one split personality: the emotive andcognitive functions are not only disturbed but also {\em dissociated} from eachother; hallucinations or delusions of grandeur or persecution {\em invade}consciousness of a paranoid schizophrenic; {\em attacks} of silly and incoherentlaughter, grimace, unmotivated giggle are symptoms of disorganisedschizophrenia.

My decision toachieve a goal may be opposed by external factors or my own inability orlaziness.  This is trivial at the level of \co{objects} (which are \co{external}and given rather than chosen) and of \co{complexes} (where there is always\co{more} which \co{I} cannot conquer).  But \co{I am not the master} also inthe more profound sense of not being the master even of \co{my} being, of notpossessing even \co{myself}.  My will to be good may never get realised,sometimes due to my obvious weakness or impatience, sometimes due to unclear andhardly \co{visible} obstacles; where failure can be blamed on my own incapacityas well as on bad luck.  \co{I} do not decide to fall in love with a givenperson or not.  \co{I} may do even if, as far as \co{I} can see or as the courseof life shows, the person is not the one \co{I} would like to love.  My hope forhappiness may never find fulfillment -- not only because \co{I} constantly findfeatures of \co{myself} precluding it, but simply because \co{I} am unhappy.There are sufferings of which \co{I} can be acutely aware and which \co{I} canfirmly defy but which, nevertheless, last for years leaving hardly any hope thatthey may ever terminate.  There are states in which one wants to say: \citet{Let  me perish, let me die!

But this is rather an extreme witness.  \co{Acts} and \co{actions}are involved in the texture of \co{the world} and, possibly, in the broadercontext of \co{activities}. In this respect, they may be studied as\co{objective}, purposeful ways of achieving various goals or as expressions ofvarious needs.  But this does not exhaust their significance.  \co{Acts} and, inparticular, the ways in which they are carried out, are not determinedexclusively by \co{my will} nor their \co{objective} context. Every \co{act}, inaddition to its \co{objective} context, in addition to its \co{visible} content,involves an undefinable \co{rest}, a side which does not pertain to its\co{objective} determinations. For instance, \citet{the value \thi{good} [...]  is present as if \thi{behind} the acts of will, and this in the essential way;  it cannot therefore be intended {\em in} these acts.}{MaxForm}{I:1.2;p.48.\orig{Der Wert \thi{gut} [...]  befindet sich gleichsam    \thi{auf dem R\"{u}cken} [Willens]aktes, und zwar wesensnotwendig; er kann    daher nie {\em in} diesem Akte intendiert sein.} \thi{Der Wert gut} can be  an example of \co{invisible}.  Let's only remind that for Scheler it is first  of all the value pertaining to a person manifested, as the quotation  indicates, only in the \co{rest} of the acts.}  An \co{act} directed by \co{my  will}, aimed at a specific objective, has an involuntary aura around itselfwhich indicates something else, often different, than its intention has put intoit. Trivialising to the extreme (or, perhaps, complicating more than necessary),one distinguishes the \thi{what} from the \thi{how}, as the case may be, the\thi{matter} from the \thi{form}, the \thi{conscious} from the\thi{unconscious}. With Heidegger the \thi{how} of the acts is not only moreimportant than the \co{objective} \thi{what}, but is the genuine,non-{objectifiable} site of their ontological significance.\ftnt{Our \thi{how}  tends more in the direction of explicit understanding, towards the  \co{objectivity} of Heideggerian \thi{what}. Thus it seems we may be using  this pair in exactly opposite way. In either case, both our \thi{how} and  \thi{what} belong to the sphere of \co{visibility}, although the latter  touches the ultimate \co{that}.}  It seems that nothing is ever the same,nothing is ever fully itself, that the search for the ultimate \thi{in itself}always encounters some overlooked \co{rest}, which germinates underneath theestablished foundations so that \citeti{the stone which the builders refused is  become the head stone of the corner.}{Ps.}{XIX:118.22} No amount ofintentional deliberation is able to remove this \thi{unintended} \co{rest} froman \co{act}, to reduce an \co{act} to its \co{visible}, \co{actual} \thi{whats},\thi{whys}, \thi{hows}.  \citet{The fool practices concentration\lin And control  of the mind.\lin But the master is like a man asleep.

In so far as \co{I} \co{act} from love, these \co{acts} are\co{signs} of its \co{presence}. Sometimes, for some people, it may be necessaryto know that \co{I} am in love in order to apprehend the character of the\co{rest} of my \co{acts}. But, typically, it is the other way around and the\co{acts} eventually unveil this \co{rest}, their \thi{what} and \thi{how}indicate, if not prove: {this guy is in love}.  On the other hand, \co{I}\co{myself} may not know that \co{I} am, and the \co{signs} may be much more\co{visible} to others than to me. As far as \co{I} am concerned, they are\co{original} and not \co{reflected}. \co{I act} this love, \co{I} am lead andforced to act in accordance with some \co{vague} intuition, according to some\co{invisible command} which \co{I} do not grasp, perhaps, even do not know, inany case, do not control. Love is not something \co{I} decide to experience butsomething which \co{I} experience (or not); love, perhaps, toward a person\co{I} would never expect \co{myself} to fall in love with, love which, perhaps,\co{I} did not even want.  It dawns on me and then haunts me.Just like a single moment of the \thi{murder in affect} reveals the underlyingconflicts of the person going, perhaps, to the very bottom of his being, so amoment of loving intimacy may reveal and express the true love.  The expressedconflicts or love \co{transcend} by far the \hoa, they are capable of infinitemanifestations and last far beyond their \co{totality}. And yet, the moment canexpress them completely and adequately. Love finds its expression in everymoment and each such moment {incarnates} the whole \thi{essence} of this love.Love is always more than its {incarnations}, \thi{overflows} any \co{actual}expressions and, at the same time, is fully \co{present} in every true\co{sign}.\pa\label{pa:inspInt} We should make one reservation. We have used the word\wo{intuition} which, in the usual sense (not in the sense of grasping the unityof a \co{complex} in one \co{act}, as in \refp{pa:lab}), can seem appropriatefor the \oss\ of \co{invisibles}.  Strong intuitions have inspiring effect,precisely by virtue of being on the one hand \co{vague} and, on the other hand,definite, unconditional, \co{clear}.  It is this duality of \co{vagueness} andsome kind of definiteness of intuition which makes it so hard to ignore it andlet it go. It nags one and, having no \co{precise, objective} content, can notbe ignored until one follows it and finds out what it is intimating.  Intuitionsare usually only first announcements of something which, in due course, may beunveiled and seen.  As Jung says, intuition is {\em perception} via theunconscious. One has intuition {\em about} or {\em of something}.  With time andeffort, it will give place to specific explanations and \co{actual} reasonswhich reveal their place in the \co{complex} from which they arouse -- it turnsout to be a \co{sign} of something \co{visible} which has only been hiding belowthe threshold of consciousness.  Thus intuition is, in general, relative to aparticular region of Being.The \co{signs} of \co{invisibles}, on the other hand, do not lead to any such\co{actualisation}. The first \co{signs} of love may be \co{vague} and\co{actually} imperceptible, but even when they become clarified, love is notreducible to any \co{actual} insight nor, for that matter to any \co{acts},\co{actions} or a \co{totality} thereof.  It does not reside in \co{acts} or\co{activities} but, primarily, in their \co{rest}.  Intuition may be aninspiration to follow its thread and \thi{figure out}.  Love, too, inspires onebefore it finds an expression in \co{acts}. But its \co{inspiration} does notend when \co{I} realise that \co{I} am in love. On the contrary, the\co{inspiration} continues, increases and affects my whole being with anatmosphere of strength and unlimited potential, with the sense of possibility toperform not this particular \co{act} or that, but any \co{act} whatsoever.Moreover, love is not limited to any particular domain of Being, it is notrestricted to any particular object or person.  For, although focused perhaps ona particular person, it is love only to the extent it affects, transforms andimpresses the whole being with a \co{quality} and \co{command}: \citet{love, and  do what you wilt}{AugustJohn}{VII:8} -- not a command to do this or that, buta \co{vaguest} (not limited to {\em any} particular domain of Being), and yet\co{clear} (intense and definite) \co{command} to do whatever you want {\em in}love.\ftnt{Recall that \co{clear} is not opposed to \co{vague} but to  \co{precise}, footnote~\ref{ftnt:clear}.}  To what \co{precisely} it\co{inspires} remains undetermined and open, it will be determined by all kindsof details -- the \co{command} is not a moral imperative to do this rather thanthat, nor to do things in a prescribed manner. It is only a \co{command} tolisten to it, to remember its \co{inspiring} voice in all \co{actual}situations. The \co{inspiration} is \co{clear}: \citt{Love is infallible; it has  no errors, for all errors are the want of love.}{William Law} But also, sinceit does not \co{command} any specific \co{acts}, it is \co{vague}: it\citeti{does not perform any works; it is too subtle for that and is as far from  performing any works as heaven is from earth.}{Eckhart, \btit{German    Sermons}}{Luke I:26,28. The subject of the quotation is grace.  [\citeauthor*{W}{ 29}; \citeauthor*{LW}{ 38}; \citeauthor*{EckSelected}{    2\kilde{p.118}}]}\wtsep{inspiration/command}\pa The \oss\ of \co{invisibles} are not any feelings or concepts, are not anyinsights or states of ecstasy, but \co{absolute} \co{commands}.  The characterof a \co{command} consists in the complete lack of reactive character.  These\co{signs} neither are reactions to anything nor cause any specific reaction.Paradoxically as it may look, this is exactly the \co{command} -- it challengesbut does not cause, it calls but does not force.\ftnt{We can say about these  \co{signs} exactly what Bergson says about the mystics.  \citef{They have no    need to exhort us.  They only have to exist, for their existence is a    call.}{BergTwo}{}}  \co{Immediate signs}, like sensations, exemplify theextreme opposite of a \co{command} in that there the \co{sign}, the signifiedand the reaction coincide.  There is no \co{distance} between the \co{sign} andreaction to it, no distance which could leave doubt and possibility of reactingotherwise, no \co{distance} between the \co{actuality} and \co{non-actuality}allowing the \co{actual sign} to challenge, to \co{inspire} a movement towardsthe \co{non-actual}.  The \co{commanding} or \co{inspiring} character of a\co{sign} is precisely this \co{distance} separating the \co{virtuality} of the\co{invisible} from its possible \co{actualisations}.\ftnt{We might probably go  as far as saying that any distance separating a \co{sign} from the signified  is a command.  In any case, any experience of such a distance is also an  experience of a command. In the most trivial case, it is merely the command to  interpret the sign, to understand what it signifies, what it means. Here it  has almost reactive character. We do not contemplate the commanding character  of a road sign or a signpost -- we immediately understand it.  But the longer  the \co{distance} separating the two (and it is something entirely different  from the arbitrariness of an artificial sign), the more insistent the nagging  to relate them.}The \co{command} consists also in that it does not create any particular statelike, for instance, feelings do. There is no emotional or mental statecorresponding to love or holiness. A \co{command} acts also when it is not heardand it can make itself heard at any time, in any situation, in any \co{mood}.Likewise, it can be followed at any time, in any situation, irrespectively of thevariations of particular \co{moods} and \co{thoughts}.  \citt{Take ye heed,  watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. For the Son of Man is as a  man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his  servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.  Watch  ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at evening,  or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning: Lest coming suddenly  he find you sleeping.  And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.}{Mk.  XIII, 33-37}                  \wtsep{absolute} \pa The \co{absoluteness} of \co{commands} consists in that they arenot relative to any particular domain of Being.  Love which is limitedto a particular domain of \co{the world} may still be love but is notthe \co{absolute} love, because such a limitation to a particularregion of \co{the world} is the same as a limitation to a particularregion of \co{my life}. Both and any of these limitations make itrelative to this region. Saying that the \co{absolute commands} are not relative to any particular regionof Being is the same as saying that they concern the whole Being.  Theypenetrate to and flow from the very depth of one's person, the point in infinity,which is but the reflection of the infinity of Being. They do not concern anybeing in particular and, by this very token, concern every particular being. Butthey do so not by enumeration of all beings but by being seated in the verycenter of personal being and thus are spread over all particular beings the personmay encounter.  Such \co{signs} either are given \co{absolutely}, with unconditionalvalidity, permeating one's whole being, or are not given at all.  A person cannot be \thi{partially holy}, just like one can be \thi{partially satisfied}. Onecan not \thi{love a little but not entirely}, for such a thing is not love butsomething else.\wtsep{freedom}\pa Instead of presenting some recognisable content, instead of providing onewith the imperative to do this rather than that, a \co{command} merely says\wo{you shall love}. \citet{For commandments from the Lord should not be  expected in matters that have an obvious usefulness.}{AbelardPJC}{I:\para 123}Lacking any precise, \co{actual} content, the \co{commands} do not give anyreasons either, they do not provide any explanations or justifications.  They donot try to convince but merely {manifest} and~\ldots leave one free.  Alsotherein consists their \co{absoluteness}.\noo{One finds many expressions like  \citf{God forces no one, for love cannot compel, and God's service, therefore,    is a thing of perfect freedom.}{Hans Denk} The intuitions, I think, are the  same.}The freedom in confrontation with a \co{command} lies in the indeterminacy of\co{actual} content.  But it may be, and often is, announced with anirresistible force.  \Oss\ of \co{invisibles} may enter one's life in the mostrare moments of revelation, moments when \co{invisible} enters the \hoa\ withimperative intensity.  They say that a dying person may experience his wholelife compressed into a single moment.  But one need not be dying.  There arerare moments which reveal to us something fundamental, \co{inspirations} whichmay turn out to determine our whole future life, or else, which show us themeaning of our past life; moments, whether in dreams or in wake life, when thecontent and meaning of the whole life seems to be compressed into a single\co{sign}.  Such moments have a character of foundation, they insert into ourtime \co{an experience} of meaning and value which exceed all \co{reflective}understanding. These are the moments establishing \la{axis mundi}, founding thecosmos out of chaos.  Although, in our \co{experience}, we might have livedquite an orderly life before, confrontation with such moments has, then too, thecharacter of founding something which either gives a completely new direction,or else lends extra strength of explicit \co{presence} to something which hasbeen only vaguely and implicitly intuited before.%%%%\pa%%The highest \co{signs} reveal holiness -- of a person, of the \co{world}, of the%%whole being.

And yet, \co{as signs}, they are not empty.\noo{\co{Inspiration} does not  appear as a \co{precise concept} or thought -- it appears as a \co{vague},  often hardly discernible, and yet clear and definite \co{intuition}.\ftnt{Let    us only remind that \co{vagueness} is related only to indeterminacy of    \co{actual} contents, which is something very different from \co{unclarity}.    The opposite of \co{vague} is not \co{clear} but \co{precise}.}  But unlike  an \co{idea} which never can be fully present, which is only an ideal limit of  \co{complex} thought, what is \co{inspiring} admits full \co{incarnation} --  it can be found \thi{in flesh}, in \co{this world}. A meeting with a holy  person, an experience of love may give a full taste of the \co{invisibles}, of  holiness, of love.

A \co{symbol} doesnot signify in the proper sense -- it merely \co{manifests}; although it doesbring forth something \co{vaguely distinguished}, its \co{inspiration} derivesfrom the \co{virtual signification}, from its pointing beyond the\co{distinctions} towards their \co{origin}. The \co{symbolic} contents cannever be sharply \co{dissociated} from each other, for one immediately andimperceptibly flows into another.  What in the Jungian analyses of unconsciousis called \wo{contamination} is such a \citet{moonlit landscape. All the  contents are blurred and merge into one another, and one never knows exactly  what or where anything is, or where one begins and ends.}{MHSFranz}{p.183} Theinseparability of \co{distinctions} is the main feature distinguishing the\co{non-actuality} from \co{actuality}, and it only gradually increases as weapproach the ultimate \co{origin}.  We can certainly speak about \thi{symbols of  God}, \thi{symbols of self}, \thi{symbols of transformation}, etc., but to theextent these are \co{experienced symbols}, they do not emerge as so definitelyseparated as they may appear when turned into \co{reflective} thoughts.  Genuine\co{symbols} \citet{cannot be exhaustively interpreted, either as signs or as  allegories. They are genuine symbols precisely because they are ambiguous,  full of half-glimpsed meanings, and in the last resort inexhaustible. [\ldots]  The discriminating intellect naturally keeps on trying to establish their  singleness of meaning and thus misses the essential point: for what we can  above all establish as the one thing consistent with their nature is their  {\em manifold meaning}, their almost limitless wealth of reference, which  makes any unilateral formulation impossible.}{JungArche}{I:80} Being\co{signs}, that is, to the extent they appear, \co{symbols} are embraced withinthe \hoa, but what they \co{manifest} is neither any specific content nor anydefinite referent; it is immediately \co{recognised} as {\em essentially}\co{transcending} this horizon.\wtsep{2: collective, above one}\pa \co{Symbols reflect} the \oss, the most individual \co{experience} of sacrednuminosity, the \co{experience} which confronts \co{me} not only with\co{myself} but with \co{my self}.  \citet{When we attempt to understand  symbols, we are not only confronted with the symbol itself, but we are brought  up against the wholeness of the symbol-producing individual.}{MHSJung}{p.81}This individual is not, of course, \co{oneself} nor one's \co{ego}, butsomething greater than the individual himself. \co{Symbols} emerge through usbut they are not created by us, they are better thought of as \citetib{natural  and spontaneous products. No genius has ever sat down with a pen or a brush in  his hand and said: <<Now I am going to invent a symbol.>>}{MHSJung}{p.41}\co{Transcending} thus {one's} personal sphere, \co{symbols} have a powerfulcollective aspect.  As Jung's extensive investigations suggest, humans tend toexpress the \co{experience} of \co{invisibles} (which, for the moment, we canidentify with his archetypes) by analogous, \co{symbolic} forms and ideas.Whether \co{manifested} in dreams, in myths, in religious conceptions, or evenin philosophical \co{concepts}, the \co{invisible} sphere revealed by\co{symbols} seems to be the deepest layer of human being, the collective (touse Jung's term) aspect of the psyche, relatively independent from the personally\thi{subjective} context and cultural tradition.  The deepest, the most personalis exactly that which, being universally \co{participated} does not become acommonality -- the \co{absolute}, unrepeatable \co{concreteness} of\co{incarnation} of \co{invisibles}.  To the extent this becomes expressed andembraced by a collective culture, it can happen only through \co{symbols}.A \thi{holy stone}, a \thi{holy tree}, a \thi{holy brook} are \co{signs}announcing the \co{presence} of sacrum. As Eliade aptly illustrates, they arenot worshiped \thi{in-themselves}, they are not \thi{the holiness itself}. Theyare worshiped only because sacrum has marked its \co{presence} {\em at} theseplaces, because it has \co{manifested} itself {\em through} them. They arehierophanies, the \co{signs} of sacrum which infinitely \co{transcends} them andyet is \co{concretely present} in them.  They may serve as simplest examples of\co{symbols}, the \co{visible, external objects} which \co{inspire} -- awe,fear, wonder, reverence -- and \co{command}, not any specific \co{acts}, butveneration and rituals which take their particular form from elsewhere, fromthe myths, from the tradition, from the religious culture. %\newpa\wtsep{3: personal - if not, become empty}\pa \co{Transcending} {one's} personal sphere, \co{symbols} are nevertheless themost personal things. To be a \co{symbol}, the \co{actual sign} must beaccompanied by the \co{original command}. \co{Symbols} are only\co{externalised} and {objectified} \co{reflections} of the \oss.  Here lie ofcourse unlimited possibilities of discrepancies and conflicts between theindividual \thi{feelings} of the high, deep and reverent and the publiclyrecognised \co{symbols} and accepted forms of their reverence.  The\co{distance} separating the \co{actuality} of the \co{sign} from its meaningis, in the case of \co{symbols}, virtually infinite.  The relation of\co{signification}, once the \co{symbol} gets \co{dissociated} from the \oss,seems completely arbitrary. Almost anything can become a \co{symbol} and thereis nothing easier than to ask: Why this tree? Why a tree?  Why the cross? Whythis and not that? Why anything at all? -- and then conclude that there is noreasonable answer. \co{Symbols} become \thi{mere symbols} for all too intense\co{reflection} which notices that mere signs are \co{actually dissociated} fromany real \co{presence} which they should announce with some forcing necessity. But even then \co{symbols} can act asreminders of this \co{presence}, whose \oss\ have been forgotten underneath the\co{visible} expressions.\paEstablishing \co{symbols} is one of the fundamental needs and {activities},as they are the only \rss\ connecting the \co{actual} consciousness with thesphere of \co{invisible presence}.\ftnt{It can be seen in the seriousness with  which children, in their games, {\em are} mothers, fathers, policemen or  arrange doll houses and build models -- without slightest disturbance by the  fact, of which they are perfectly aware, that these are only games, toys.  Likewise, the pictures from Lascaux are hardly mere traces of boredom or  depictions of nothing but daily trivialities. Extensive studies of Eliade and  others suggest that the maintenance of the symbolic, and yet concrete,  proximity of sacrum to the sphere of profanum is one of the founding aspects  of the earliest cultures.}  But \co{signs} become \co{symbols} only when they\co{actually manifest} the \co{invisible}, that is, only when they are met andexperienced along with the respective \oss.  What constitutes a \co{symbol} isthe double aspect of the \co{invisible} flowing in through the \co{visible}, ofthe \co{inspiration} arising through the \co{actual sign}. The \co{inspirations}are not any emotions but, without picking on such details of expression, wecould say that the archetypal \co{inspirations} \citet{are, at the same time,  both images and emotions. One can speak of an archetype only when these two  aspects are simultaneous. When there is merely the image, then there is simply  a word-picture of little consequence.  But by being charged with emotion,%[feeling = value judgment for Jung], the image gains numinosity (or psychic energy); it becomes dynamic, andconsequences of some kind must follow from it.}{MHSJung}{p.87}\co{Reflection} devoted exclusively to the petty and all-important matters ofits \co{actuality} is simply unable to meet a \co{symbolic} expression, even ifit meets its \co{visible sign}. The meaning of a \co{symbol} has close tonothing in common with the meanings discernible at the level of \co{actuality},the meanings of \co{precise} words, \co{concepts} or particular\co{impressions}. And in the moment the \co{invisible presence} is declaredunreal, a \co{symbol} degenerates to an empty \co{sign}.  In the moment a\co{symbol} starts signifying something \co{visible}, it becomes an allegory,eventually, a mere \co{sign}. Put differently, a \co{command} is meaningful only in so far as it is not\co{dissociated} from its \co{origin}.  It has unconditional validity only forthe one who hears it.  The living relation to the \co{actual} person is its truenature.  Stripping \co{symbolic origin} of its intrinsically \co{invisible}character (that is, \co{externalising} it in an {objectified} form,\co{dissociated} from the reality of its \co{manifestation} through the livingperson) leaves only arbitrariness of an artificial \co{sign} and theincomprehensible \thi{so it is}. Such \co{symbols} may preserve some element ofthe mystical character, but they lose their \co{commanding} force.  They maythen function as mere messages, \co{signs} pointing to \co{another world} in anindifferent, anonymous way.  This is what happens to \co{symbols}, whether inliterature, painting or mythology, when they have been \co{dissociated} fromtheir \co{invisible} meaning.  They appear as arbitrary.  Empty \co{symbols} arethe \co{original commands} turned by tradition, culture, repetition or personalestrangement into {\em mere indications}, pointers towards nothing specificallydiscernible and therefore devoid of any concrete meaning.  Their originally\co{vague} meaning and their lack of any identifiable referent turn into lack ofmeaning and emptiness of denotation.  At best, they only try -- deficiently andunsuccessfully - to indicate something vague, unknown, which \citetib{is never  precisely defined or fully explained.  [And one can not] hope to define or  explain it.}{MHSJung}{p.4} But \co{symbol} never explains {\em what} it issaying -- it only says it.  It is a pure expression, totally open tomisinterpretation, which in particular means, to being ignored. At the sametime, it is entirely \co{clear} to the one who happens to grasp it, because tograsp it means to already know what it expresses -- the \co{symbol} is only ameans of \co{actualising} this \thi{knowledge}, making it conscious.  Hence\citetib{[t]o the scientific mind, such phenomena as symbolic ideas are a  nuisance because they cannot be formulated in a way that is satisfactory to  intellect and logic.}{MHSJung}{p.80}\subsub{The invisibles} There are things which do not belong to \co{this world}in the way tools, commodities, situations, daily objects, relations, feelingsand thoughts do, but which are from \co{another world}; world which does notobey our dictates but which is the source of gifts and calamities surpassing ourpowers.  They are from \co{another world} but this \thi{otherness} is notabsolutely foreign, alien -- \co{another world} is still the \co{world}.Although \co{transcending} the sphere of phenomena, of all \co{actual  experiences}, they \co{manifest} their \co{presence} in such \co{experiences},they too enter the horizon of one's \co{experience}.  But even when encounteredin a single moment, in a single \co{act} of \co{actual} consciousness, onealways knows that what is so encountered is only a \co{sign} of something thatis \thi{greater}, something that only \co{manifests} itself without exposingitself.\pa %\ad{Symbols -- only incarnated}\co{Symbols} and \co{commands} do not reveal anything definite.  One might betempted to say that there is therefore no distinction between the \co{signs} andwhat they signify, that the only things made present are the very \co{signs}.But such a description, which might be given at the level of \co{immediacy}, isnot adequate here.  For \co{signs} announce here not so much anything particularbut only the \co{distance} to whatever they may be announcing. They\co{manifest} something \co{invisible}, something more than not only themselvesbut than any \co{actuality} of \co{an experience}.  A mere \co{sign} \citetib{is  always less than the concept it represents, while a symbol always stands for  something more than its obvious and immediate meaning.}{MHSJung}{p.41} The\co{commanding} character of a \co{symbol} does not determine any immediatereaction, on the contrary, it only \co{inspires} to look for possible ways of\co{actualising} the \co{manifested} \co{invisibles}.However, this \co{invisible} something becomes \co{present} only through its\co{manifestations}, it cannot be meaningfully abstracted from them. When\co{posited} as a \co{dissociated} entity, it loses its fundamental feature,\co{concreteness}, and becomes a \thi{mere word}, an empty concept. Its\co{concreteness} is this impossibility to \co{dissociate} it from its\co{manifestations}, to abstract from them any common \thi{essence}, withoutlosing the thing itself. It is \co{concrete} because, to the extent it is, it is\co{manifested}, and to the extent it is not \co{manifested}, it is an emptyconcept.To be \co{invisible} is to be \co{essentially non-actual}, is to be a\co{distinction} which can never be fully embraced -- as a \co{concept} or\co{an experience} -- within the \hoa.  \citeti{The gentle flame of eye did  chance to get\lin Only a little of the earthen part.}{Empedocles}{ DK 31B85}\co{Invisibles} are not any \co{objective} entities and yet they are\co{experienced} because they are \co{present} in our \co{experience}.  They are\co{distinctions} without anything distinguished, appearances without objects,phenomena without the noematic correlates, powers without any identifiablecenter.  Being essentially \co{non-actual}, the \co{invisibles} can\co{manifest} themselves for \co{reflection} only through \co{symbols} --\citet{our only approach to divine things is through symbols.}{DDI}{I:11.32}They \citet{spring from a deep source that is not made by consciousness and is  not under its control. In the mythology of earlier times, these forces were  called \la{mana}, or spirits, demons, and gods. They are as active today as  they ever were.}{MHSJung}{p.71}\pa %\ad{Objective}\co{Invisibles} are \co{absolute}, that is, they are not relative to anyparticular region of Being. Their \co{presence} precedes any \co{recognisable}\co{distinctions}, and hence embraces the whole person, before one can \co{act}and protest. They cast their shadow (or rather their light), as irrevocable as it isingraspable, as intense as it is \co{indistinct}, on all particular beings and\co{actual objects}.An aspect of this \co{absoluteness} is independence from any lower feelings andthoughts. They have no well-defined expression and can be \co{present} in anykind of particulars.  Thus, they allow variations at the lower levels which donot affect their \co{presence}. Love remains love independently from thefeelings, \co{moods} and \co{sensations} one might experience in all particularsituations. In fact, their experiences will be affected by the love which lies \co{above} them.%\ad{Indeterminate}Irreducibility to and inexhaustibility by \co{actual} determinations meansfurthermore the complete indeterminacy of the form, shape, character and context ofpossible \co{manifestations}.  There is no unique, well defined rangeof phenomena which exhaust the possible \co{manifestations} ofsainthood, love, ontological \co{thirst}, damnation. There are no \co{objective}criteria telling one from another.  This is just another side of the\co{concreteness} of \co{invisibles}, of their inseparability from\co{manifestations}.  For though we lack any \co{actual} determinations,though we lack concepts of love, sainthood, hatred, we do not lackexperience; we can \co{recognise} themwhen meeting them in experience.\pa\label{pa:anamnesisB}Each person is an unrepeatable, that is, original source of variations, alwaysnew variations over the same theme of \co{existential confrontation}, whichbegins (just after {\em the} beginning) with the \co{invisibles}.  Nobody canteach anybody what love means and how to love except, possibly to some extent, by the very example, that is, byoffering the \co{experience} of love.  Nobody can teach anybody whatit means to be a mother or father, for even the best (or worst) examples, mayeventually result in one being quite the opposite when playing the role oneself.  Even the destitute children raised without oneor both of the parents, know what motherhood or fatherhood means, if not inother ways then simply by living their lack and thirsting for them.This is much more adequate sphere for the application of Plato's\gre{anamnesis} simile\noo{The word \wo{theory} would be vastlyinappropriate here.} then the field of \co{concepts}, \thi{essences} and generalities. \co{Invisibles} pertain to everybody's \co{experience} andtheir structural similarity is far stronger than apparent differencesin contents, in \co{objective} particulars.  Encounteringlove, hatred, mystical experience, spiritual strength, we suddenly\ldots \thi{remember}.  We never know for sure, at least not at once: is {\emthis} love or not, is {\em this} sainthood or not. But the very doubt whether thisis {\em it},\noo{(the reference to the respective \co{signs}, words, images),}witnesses to the fact of \co{recognition}.  Even if we neverexperienced it before, we know (\co{vaguely} and \co{imprecisely})what we are meeting now for the first time.  The doubt is almostunavoidable because it only reflects the complete lack of anyuniversal and \co{objective} characteristics, the thoroughly personaldimension of such \co{experiences} and their irreducibility to any \co{actual signs}.\noo{which call for a new, individual \co{manifestation}.}\pa %\ad{flowing into each other}\co{Invisibles}, as the first and deepest \co{distinctions}, form the spheresurrounding the ultimately \co{invisible origin}. They are like \citet{the  intellection that remains within its place of origin; it has that source as  substratum but becomes a sort of addition to it in that it is an activity of  that source perfecting the potentiality there, not by producing anything but  as being a completing power to the principle in which it  inheres.}{Plotinus}{VI:7.40}In terms of the figure from~\refp{fig:levels}, p.\pageref{fig:levels}, the\co{invisibles} are the most dense nuclei on the circle closest to the origin$\bullet$, reflecting the part of the line to the left of L and right of R whichnever enters the \co{actual experience}. They have no \co{objective}, nor even{objectifiable} correlates, nothing \co{actual} can ever fully \co{represent}them, no \co{actual sign} can ever coincide with them.  The \co{invisible}contents may vary (say, depending on where, on the line, the circle is), but theuniversal fact of primary importance to us is the very \co{presence} of thissphere in our being and \co{experience}. The structural relation of this sphereto the others will remain constant for a given circle and identical for allbeings \thi{of this kind}.Still in terms of this figure, the \thi{closeness} to the \co{origin} means alsothe inseparable connections, dense beyond the possibility of \co{dissociatere-cognitions}.\ftnt{Cf. comments in Book I on figure in \refp{pa:stages},  especially, \refp{pa:density} and the footnote~\ref{ftnt:density},  p.\pageref{pa:density}.} In terms of \co{actual reflection} we like toconsider the problem of freedom, then of truth, then of meaning, then of love,each for itself. But we very quickly realise that to the degree we succeed insuch a \co{dissociation}, the treatment and the results become so much moresterile. Each of \co{invisibles} \citet{contains all within itself, and at the  same time sees all in every other, so that everywhere there is all, and all is  all and each all [...] In our real all is part rising from part and nothing  can be more than partial; but There each being is an eternal product of a  whole and is at once a whole and an individual manifesting as part but, to the  keen vision There, known for the whole it is.}{Plotinus}{V:8.4}Finally, interpreting the interval between L and R as the range of\co{experiences} in the circle's life span, the changes -- as the circle movesaround -- in the sphere of \co{invisible} contents will be extremely slowcompared to the changes in the \co{actual experiences}.  \citet{Whereas we think  in periods of years, the unconscious thinks and lives in terms of  millennia.}{JungArche}{VI:499} The \co{invisibles} are the most constant\co{aspects} of \co{experience}: the movements of the circle involve majorchanges in the \co{actual} contents (closest to the point where the circletouches the line), while the higher, \co{invisible} constellations remainvirtually unaffected by the changes of the circle's position.  Unlike changing\co{actual} news, \co{invisibles} are always \co{present}, even if not\co{manifest} in \co{actual signs}. This is the meaning of \co{presence} whichis very different from \co{actualisation}.  The latter involves explicitpresence, \co{actuality} of the \co{sign} or \co{object}; it is a matter of thespecificity of the moment which is dominated by a particular \co{sign} of a\co{visible} or \co{invisible} content.  \co{Presence}, on the other hand, doesnot require any explicit givenness; it denotes constant proximity of\co{invisibles}, felt or not, as if in the background of, and hence independentfrom, the \co{actuality} of our attentive observation. \co{Manifestations} are\co{aspects} of these \co{actual experiences} in which \co{presence} comes forthand becomes strongly \co{experienced}, even if it does not become the \co{actual  object} of these \co{experiences}.\pa If we only keep in mind the difference between \co{experiences} and\co{experience} (which, perhaps, comes closer to experiencing), we would say that\co{invisibles} offer the ground of all \co{experience} and, as such, arethemselves \co{experienced}:\begin{itemize}\MyLPar\item   as the contentless indeterminacy, respecting one's freedom, the \co{invisibles}offer \co{experience} of \co{nothingness};\item   as the overflowing surplus and inexhaustible potential for ever new\co{manifestations} -- \co{experience} of the \co{origin}, the source of meaningfulness; \item   as the \co{transcendence} unaffected by \co{my}choices and actions -- \co{experience} of eternity; \item   as the \co{inspiration} and \co{command} -- \co{experience} of \co{absolute} power\ldots%\item   \ldots \end{itemize}\noo{ check again Rudolf Otto}\subsubi{Invisible or simply  unconscious?}\label{sub:notunconscious}\label{se:JungPlotinus}%Most characteristics of archetypes (with few exceptions to be discussed below)given by Jung can be applied to the \co{invisibles} as well.  They are not any\co{visible} contents capable of being grasped within the \hoa, they are not anyspecific \co{representations}, nor any mythological images or motifs. At best,they stand for \citet{a tendency to form such representations of a motif --  representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their  pattern.}{MHSJung}{p.58} \citetib{They grow up from the dark depths of the mind  like a lotus and form a most important part of the subliminal  psyche.}{MHSJung}{p.25} We should, however, clarify one main difference whichconcerns the status of the unconscious contents vs. \co{invisibles}.\pa There are many known examples of scientists \thi{receiving}solutions to their problems from unconscious.  Often these come fromdreams, like Kekule's dream of a snake biting its tail or vonNeumann's dreams of the actual proofs of his theorems.  Gauss tells abouta theorem which he found \citeti{not by painstaking research, but by theGrace of God, so to speak.  The riddle solved itself as lightningstrikes, and I myself could not tell or show the connection betweenwhat I knew before, what I last used to experiment with, and whatproduced the final result.}{C.~F.~Gauss \citaft{MHSFranzB}{ p.383/385}}{} Intenseengagement in some well-defined problem will often stimulate the mindto carrying further work, apparently at the same level of \co{precision}, although not involving \co{active reflection}.Fascinating as such events may be, they are not exactly what we are aiming athere. What emerges in such cases are \co{actual} contents expressed\co{precisely} in the categories of conscious thinking.  True, they emerge fromthe unconscious, but it is only the process which is unconscious -- the initialinput as well as the results are thoroughly \co{precise} contents of\co{reflective} thinking.  A slightly different aspect may be adumbrated in theapparently quite analogous experiences of artists.  Klee: \citeti{My hand is  entirely the instrument of a more distant sphere. Nor is it my head that  functions in my work; it is something else \ldots}{P.~Klee \citaft{MHSJaffe}{    p.308}}{} Pollock: \citeti{When I am in my painting I am not aware of what I  am doing. It is only after a sort of `get acquainted' period that I see what I  have been about.}{J.~Polloc \citaft{MHSJaffe}{ p.308}}{(By the way, these two  quotations illustrate also, in addition to the common aspect which concerns us  here, the enormous difference between the intellectual poetry of Klee's and  the uncontrolled expressionism of Pollock's paintings.) See also footnote  I:\ref{ftnt:artist}, p.\pageref{ftnt:artist}.}  Although the process isequally unconscious, the initial input is probably of a different order than inthe case of the scientists.  Often, there may be no discernible inputwhatsoever, not even a hunch, but a mere impulse \thi{now I should/can paint}.Although much conscious work may precede and be involved in the process ofartistic creation, the consciousness is here concerned with contents of adifferent order than those of scientific consciousness.  What is received by anartist is not a ready-made solution to an \co{actual} problem, but a\thi{guidance}, as if by a \thi{directing force}, during the process ending withthe \co{actual} expression which so, perhaps after a \thi{get acquainted}period, is seen as a \thi{match}, as a satisfying \co{actualisation} not of anypreconceived idea, but of the initial, \co{vague} %and hardly identifiableintuition.\noo{The corresponding \thi{intuitive guidance} can be, sometimes,  observed in great scientists -- not, however, so obviously at the level of  single results as in terms of the whole life\ldots (Einstein catching  light-beam)}\paThis should indicate the fundamental difference:the difference not so much between conscious as opposed to unconscious, as between \co{actual} as opposed to \co{non-actual}.  The two distinctions are orthogonal, they cut the horizon of experience along pretty independent lines. One can be \begin{itemize}\MyLPar\item[1.a] \co{reflectively} conscious of the tree one is looking at or \item[1.b] merely \co{aware} of it (which, probably, would be counted as being unconscious of it, since the fact that one does not stumble into trees, although one does not pay any \co{reflective} attention to them, is credited to unconsciousness or subconsciousness). \end{itemize}But one can also be\begin{itemize}\MyLPar\item[2.a] \co{reflectively} aware of the indefinable thirst of one's soul, of a vague dissatisfaction with \ldots \fre{je ne sais quoi}, or\item[2.b] entirely unconscious (only \co{aware}?) of it. \end{itemize}Our distinction \co{actual} vs. \co{non-actual} is that between 1.  and 2.,while the distinction conscious-unconscious is, in each case, that between a.and b.\ftnt{We gloss over more detailed differences like, for instance, that  with Jung consciousness involves necessarily opposites, while with us only  sufficiently \co{precise distinctions}, of which opposites are extreme cases.  Also, since our consciousness spans everything from \co{awareness} to  \co{reflection}, we have obviously the degrees of consciousness.  The extreme  of \co{awareness} will often be the same as psychoanalysis' subconsciousness.  Perhaps the most significant is that Jung's consciousness is the {\em    totality} of contents related to his \thi{ego}, which seems to be simply  constituted as the subjective pole of this totality.  With us, \co{reflection}  is always only an \co{actual act}, and the \thi{conscious ego} is nothing but  the \co{actual subject} of such an \co{act}. The \co{totality} of such  \co{acts} \co{transcends reflection} and pertains to \co{oneself} but in no  way constitutes it.}\noo{Jung says: \citet{By consciousness I understand the relation of psychic    contents to the {\em ego}, in so far as this relation is perceived as such    by the ego. Relations to the ego that are not perceived as such are    unconscious. Consciousness is the function or activity which maintains the    relation of psychic contents to the ego. Consciousness is not identical with    the {\em psyche} because the psyche represents the totality of all psychic    contents, and these are not necessarily all directly connected with the ego,    i.e., related to it in such a way that they take on the quality of    consciousness.}{JungTypes}{\para 700 \citaft{CC}{ II;p.36}}    Consequently, unconsciousness is a container of all kinds of contents:  sensations, perceptions and all kinds of physiological process not coming to  the threshold of consciousness, but also feelings and yearnings, concepts and  understandings, the transcendent God-image and the Self in so far as these are  not addressed explicitly by the \thi{ego}.  }\pa\label{pa:Freud}Certainly, there is a big difference between being conscious and unconscious of something. But what matters much more is that {\em of which} we are conscious (or unconscious), and what we make of the contents ofour consciousness. Freud made unconsciousness pretty much the same as \co{reflection}, only \ldotsunconscious.  Its contents where repressed {\em conscious} contents. Only forthis reason one might postulate (as done constantly by Freud)\noo{, for  instance, in \citeauthor*{FreudN})} that \thi{id} should be replaced by\thi{I}, that \thi{I} should keep bringing under its control more and moreaspects of the unconscious \thi{id}, as if the ultimate (even though impossible)goal were to eradicate the latter making all its contents \co{visible}.\noo{In  the standard American terminology \thi{it} is called \wo{id} and \thi{I}  \wo{ego}, but we follow closely the critique of such Freud translations  presented in \citeauthor*{BettelFreud}, which accuses them not only for  literal inadequacy and linguistic sterility but also for actual falsification  of the spirit of Freudian humanism.} The main complication in this extensionof consciousness was a complex of mechanisms working to \thi{hide} theunconscious (though always principally \co{visible}) contents. Thus, forinstance, for the dream interpretation, one had to invent a \thi{censor}, afunction of the psyche which twisted and confused all the \co{precise} contentsof unconscious in order to hide them from consciousness.  But the \citet{form  that dream takes is natural to the unconscious because the material from which  they are produced is retained in the subliminal state in precisely this  fashion.}{MHSJung}{p.53} It is natural in so far as the \co{non-actual}contents are not expressible directly in the \co{precise, reflective} form.Even if to some degree unconsciousness indeed hides only repressed \co{visible}contents, there is much more which remains essentially \co{invisible}. Jung'sdeparture from the Freudian psychoanalysis of merely \co{visible} but repressedcontents, and his study of the \thi{collective unconscious}, that is, of thetranspersonal and not merely private and subjective dimension of the\co{experience}, is an admirable spiritual achievement of the XX-th century.The \co{invisible} contents which he finds through dream analysis carry thischaracter of \gre{anamnesis}, of something which, although appearing for thefirst time for consciousness, does not originate in it and yet can be\co{recognised}.  \citetib{[\ldots] I have found again and again in my  professional work that the images and ideas that dreams contain cannot  possibly be explained solely in terms of memory. They express new thoughts  that have never yet reached the threshold of consciousness.}{MHSJung}{p.26}The assumption of psychoanalysis (at least, in its folklore) is thatthere is nothing which, at least in principle, could not becomeconscious. The unconscious is most intimately \co{present} and we are\co{aware} of it, although there may be a long way from this \co{awareness}to the full \co{visibility} in \co{reflection}. The important thing, in so far assuch a \thi{making conscious} is concerned, is that contents entering\co{reflection} still retain fundamental mutual differences. Becoming(\co{attentively}) conscious of the tree \thi{I did not see} is very differentfrom becoming conscious of the vague dissatisfaction I have felt but did notrealise. \co{Reflection}, whether of a tree or of dissatisfaction, is fully\co{aware} of such differences, even if they do not become its \co{objects}.They are \co{recognised}, so to speak,in the background of the \co{reflective acts}, in \co{self-awareness}.The \co{invisibles} are essentially \co{non-actual} and not essentiallyunconscious. Yet, the consciousness of \co{invisibles} is of a very differentkind from the usual consciousness of \thi{this or that}.  The difference isestablished by the \co{distance} separating the \co{actual sign} from thecontent it signifies.  In case of an \co{external object} like a tree, the\co{distance} is negligible.  In case of Prague, it becomes more apparent, evenif one sticks to thinking of Prague merely as a \co{complex} of \co{actual  objects}.  In case of the \co{invisible unity} of the world, of the \co{vague}intuition and \co{imprecise} feeling of dawning love or despair, and then of the\co{clear} -- and still equally \co{vague} -- consciousness of love or despair,the \co{distance} is obvious and given in the immediate \co{awareness} that whatone is \co{actually} conscious of does not capture that which one is\co{experiencing}, \thi{the thing itself}.  Paradoxically as it may seem, thelonger this \co{distance}, the more \co{concrete} the content, that is, thedeeper it reaches into the texture of the personal being. With \co{invisibles},the virtual infinity of this \co{distance} is an \co{aspect} of the \co{absolute  concreteness} of the \co{experience} overflowing the \co{actuality} ofconscious \co{signs}.\subsubi{Invisibles, archetypes and intellect}\label{sub:invArch}\pa With the reservations just made, the archetypes carry the characteristics of\co{invisibles}. They form, as Jung calls it, the \thi{collective unconscious},the unconscious structures which, being \co{shared} by all humans, are notrelative to the individual, personal experience, even if they become\co{manifest} only in such \co{experience}.  They emerge from \co{above}(\wo{inborn} or \wo{inherited}, as the word may go), from the sphere which isnot underlied one's will and control -- they are personal but not\co{subjective}.  They are expressed in symbols and rituals of all religions andmythologies. At the same time, they are the most \co{concretely experienced}events of psychic life, in which they find thoroughly individual expression.Being the most universal in their \co{vague} and indefinite form, they also\co{found} the most \co{concrete}, the most individual. When adequately\co{recognised}, they bind the individual to the collective history andtradition, which provide objectified, symbolic expressions of the deepest\co{aspects} of personal \co{experience}.\noo{  \wtsep{1.

They can, at best, be recognisedbeyond the symbolic expressions, always endowed with a perpetual overflow ofmeanings which never reach any final form. The impossibility of \co{precise}division and description is due to the surplus of meaning flowing into anarchetype once we attempt to isolate it from the surrounding archetypes.  Theysimply can not be meaningfully \co{dissociated} from each other, even if somepatterns seem to be discernible.  \citet{It is a well-nigh hopeless undertaking  to tear a single archetype out of the living tissue of the psyche; but despite  their interwovenness they do form units of meaning that can be apprehended  intuitively.}{JungArche}{IV:302} The archetypes represent the \co{invisible},{\em essentially} \co{non-actual} contents, which emerge before, and henceremain forever \co{above}, the \co{actual} consciousness. They are inaccessibleto the \co{dissociated} categories of \co{reflective} thinking for the\citet{diversity within the Authentic depends not upon spatial separation but  sheerly upon differentiation; all Being, despite this plurality, is a unity  still; "Being neighbours Being"; all holds together.}{Plotinus}{VI:4.4. The  interpreters can certainly inquire into the \co{precise} meaning of the  difference between \thi{spatial separation} and \thi{sheer differentiation}.  But we can take it to represent the difference between \co{dissociation} and  initial, \co{vague distinctions}. The impossibility of drawing \co{reflective    distinctions} does not mean the lack of any \co{distinctions}, and the  sphere of \co{invisibles}, although differentiated, can also be unitary and  indivisible. \co{Invisibles} are \co{distinct} but can not be  \co{dissociated}, \citefib{the Intellectual-Principle is the authentic    existences and contains them all -- not as in a place but as possessing    itself and being one thing with this its content.

The \co{invisibles}, \citet{the objects of  intellection \noo{the ideal content of the Divine Mind} -- identical in virtue  of the self-concentration of the principle which is their common ground --  must still be distinct each from another; this distinction constitutes  Difference}{Plotinus}{V:1.4} or, perhaps, \fre{Diff\'{e}rance}.\wtsep{2. being=thinking}\pa\label{pa:objsubjA} Jung operates with the understandable distinction of thelevel of \co{mineness} between man, his psyche and the objective, externalworld.  The archetypes are the deepest structuring elements in the psyche, yet,they are \citet{sheer objectivity, as wide as the world and open to all the  world.  [In the collective unconscious] I am the object of every subject, in  complete reversal of my ordinary consciousness, where I am always the subject  that has an object.  There I am utterly one with the world, so much part of it  that I forget all too easily who I am.  \thi{Lost in oneself} is a good way of  describing this state.  But this self is the world, if only consciousness  could see it.}{JungArche}{I:46} Consciousness of archetypes, even though itremains in the \co{actuality} of an \co{act}, involves suspension of the\co{reflective dissociation} into \co{subject-object}. More importantly,however, at the level of \co{invisibles} such a \co{dissociation} simply doesnot obtain. Sainthood has no \co{object}, just like genuine \co{love} does nothave any, they are not opposed to any \thi{outside} but contain the whole world\thi{within}. They do not \co{act} on any \co{external objects}, for \co{actual  objects} are not goals of their \co{actions}, but only occasions for\co{manifestation}. This constant \co{presence} of the \co{rest}, of \co{clear}if undefinable \co{inspiration}, and the character of \co{expression} ratherthan of directedness towards any external goals, gives a sound, if not complete,account of the unitary and \co{self}-oriented character of the intellect, thisfirst hypostasis which \citet{apprehends itself and is object of its own  activity.}{Proclus}{\para20.

But here we encounter the true Parmenidean identity, where\citeti{being and knowing are identical because if a thing does not exist no one  knows it, but whatever has most being is most  known.}{Eckhart}{\citaft{CC}{II;p.35} The argument certainly leaves something  to be wished for but, not focusing on the arguments, we will not let this  prevent us from accepting the conclusion.} Of course, \thi{knowing},\thi{thoughts}, \thi{thinking} and \thi{being} must not be taken here in the\co{reflective} sense involving the \co{actuality} of an \co{act} and\co{dissociation} of its \co{subject} and \co{object}. In the \co{spiritual}sphere there is as yet no such distinction. The differentiation of\co{invisibles} is the condition \co{founding} the very possibility of\co{experience}, and of \co{dissociated experiences}. Without these primordial\co{distinctions}, no \co{actual objects} could ever appear. Consequently, inthe \co{spiritual} sphere, at the edge of \co{nothingness}, \wo{being} and\wo{knowing} are synonymous -- not because they happened mysteriously tocoincide, but because they have not as yet been \co{distinguished}, becauseaddressing \co{nothingness} there is not, as yet, enough material to\co{distinguish} the two.  The \co{spirit} remains, since the beginning,\wo{\co{above} the waters} and its \co{unity} is not affected by all the\co{actual distinctions} and affairs of \co{this world}.\wtsep{3. known directly = not reducible to representation/actuality}\pa The crucial feature of archetypes is that they are inexpressible in\co{precise} \co{concepts}, in the categories of \co{reflection} and\co{actuality}, in short, in images. They can be \co{symbolised}, but thecharacteristic of the \co{symbolic} relation is the complete lack of the elementof reduction, which threatens both every imaging and every imagining.\citet{This universe, characteristically participant in images, shows how the  image differs from the authentic beings: against the variability of the one  order, there stands the unchanging quality of the other, self-situate, not  needing space because having no magnitude, holding an existent intellective  and self-sufficing. The body-kind seeks its endurance in another kind; the  Intellectual-Principle, sustaining by its marvelous Being, the things which  of themselves must fall, does not itself need to look for a staying  ground.}{Plotinus}{V:9.5} We certainly do not subscribe to the language of\wo{authentic beings} and faint images among which we must live down here.  Yet,in some respects, the \co{symbolic} relation of the \co{actual} to the\co{invisible} can be compared to that of an imperfect image to its original.The \co{invisibles} are irreducible to their \co{actual signs}, just as theoriginal is not reducible to any of its images.  But this irreducibility of the\co{invisibles} does not mean their total inaccessibility. They are accessiblesimply by being lived.  \citetib{Thus we may not look for the Intellectual  objects\noo{[the Ideas]} outside of the Intellectual-Principle, treating them  as impressions of reality upon it: we cannot strip it of truth and so make its  objects unknowable and non-existent and in the end annul the  Intellectual-Principle itself. [...]  Only thus\noo{[by this inherence of the    Ideas]} is it dispensed from demonstration and from acts of faith in the  truth of its knowledge: it is its entire self, self-perspicuous: it knows a  prior by recognising its own source; it knows a sequent to that prior by its  self-identity; of the reality of this sequent, of the fact that it is present  and has authentic existence, no outer entity can bring it surer  conviction.}{Plotinus}{V:5.2} Dispensation from demonstration and from acts offaith amounts to their inadequacy which is but the other side of the directcontact with them. \co{Invisibles} are the most directly accessible because theyare the most \co{concrete}, the deepest and most intimately \co{present aspects}of \co{experience}.  It is the directness of this contact which is \co{actually}inaccessible, which can not be repeated in the purely \co{actual} categories.The \co{invisibles} may be apprehended by means of \co{symbols}, but such a\co{reflective} apprehension is not the same as grasping an \co{object}.In it, the \co{invisibles} are as if \thi{projected from within} (which\thi{projection} has nothing to do with the psychoanalytic sense of unconsciousexternalisation.)  \co{Symbolic recognition} may happen with full \co{actuality}of consciousness, with full knowledge about the \co{origin} of the \co{symbols}.But this is then a \co{recognition} of both the insurmountable \co{distance}between the symbolised content and its \co{actual} expressions, and of theimpossibility of accessing or \thi{objectifying} it by any other \co{actual}means than \co{symbolic expressions}.  The \co{symbolism} of \co{self} need notbe an unconscious \thi{projection} -- it may be a conscious \co{expression}. Butthat {\em of which} we are thus conscious is primarily the \co{distance}. What\co{precisely} is thus being \co{expressed} remains \co{vague}; it isessentially \co{invisible} and the scope of \co{reflective} consciousness cannever embrace the entire \co{concreteness} of this relation.  The relation neednot be, and hardly ever is, consummated under the attentive look of \co{actual}consciousness.  In fact, the more insistence on bringing it to consciousness,the stronger indication of some, in the extreme cases pathological, obsessionwith the opposition, of the attempts to annul the \co{distance} and make the\co{invisible visible}.\noo{But just like a happy man needs not constant \co{reflective} consciousness  of his happiness, so \co{reflective} consciousness is hardly a necessary  aspect of worthy and gratifying \co{experience}.   \pa In the sphere of\co{invisibles} there is no \co{subject} and no \co{object}.  At most, there isthe distinction between \co{self} and \co{my self}, but even this is onlyrelative to a particular stage of development.  As long as \co{I} retain any\co{distinctions}, the \co{distinctions} like these will be unavoidable and seeminsurmountable.  Yet, Jung insists that \wo{psyche is {\em real}}, not merely\thi{subjective}.  \citt{All modern people feel alone in the world of the psyche  [the qualification \wo{of the psyche} may be safely removed] because they  assume that there is nothing there that they have not made up.  [\ldots] Then  one is all alone in one's psyche, exactly like the Creator before the  creation.  But through a certain training [\ldots] something suddenly happens  which one has not created, something objective, and then one is no longer  alone.  [\ldots] This experience of the objective fact is all-important,  because it denotes the presence of something which is not I, yet is still  psychical.  Such an experience can reach a climax where it becomes an  experience of God.}{CC;p.80-81 [Jung, The Vision Seminars]}}What, if anything, is being {projected} along the \co{symbolic} relation is thevery distinction \co{subjective}-\co{objective}, \thi{psychical}-\thi{physical};it is projected into the sphere where no such distinctions are possible ormeaningful.  There is a level, albeit hardly a level of \co{experience}, where\co{my self} is \co{self}, \la{Atman} is \la{Brahman}, and where this {\em really is so}.Sure, any experience is \co{my} experience, and thus it involves \co{my actual  subjectivity}.  As long as we are looking for \co{actual experiences} as theonly measure of convincing us about anything, we can at best encounter onlyvague analogues, momentaneous \co{experiences} of \thi{oneness}, mystical union,\la{coincidentia oppositorum}, which can only, and only at best, leave a mark, a\co{vague trace}, as they disappear from the \hoa.

This, in particular means, that the contents must be unconscious,  because only unconscious contents can be \thi{projected}, according to the  psychoanalytical theory.  The question is thus:  \begin{quote}\begin{enumerate}\item The aim of the individuation process is integration of the unconscious, in  particular, archetypal contents into the wholeness of personality.\item The essential part of this process is conscious recognition of the  efficacy of the archetypes in one's life.\item The conscious experience of the archetypes is possible only through their  symbolic \thi{projections}.  \end{enumerate}    Thus, what happens to them, how are they related, if at all, to the  consciousness after the integration has taken place -- for an archetype, like  anything else made conscious is no longer liable to being \thi{projected}?  \end{quote}  I am not suggesting that this is some unresolved contradiction in the  excellent Jungian and post-Jungian practice and descriptive elaboration of the  gathered empirical material. The question concerns only conceptual  clarification.    Jungian answer would probably be that consciousness ceases to \thi{project}  archetypes into the \thi{objective} world (an activity typical for the  primitive, but also more advanced, though still not entirely self-conscious  mind of more modern mind) but, instead, becomes able to live them concretely.  The genuine myth Jung proposes for the modern man is precisely to live  archetypes in a concrete colloquy, a constant dialogue with one's unconscious  which in its deepest sphere happens to be the same as the world, the past and  the future, the ancestors and the future generations.    \pa I do not know the primitive mind well enough and I do not think we should  ascribe all too much unconsciousness to many thinkers of late Hellenism, to  medieval mystics and others who seem to display signs of quite a close contact  with the \co{invisible} sphere of Being.  Certainly, some did \thi{project}  trying to re-establish a disturbed continuity by externalising the internal,  unconscious processes, contents and assumptions.  \co{Objectivistic illusion},  too, is an example of such a \thi{projection}, which believes \co{objects}  inhabit all spheres of Being in the same way they inhabit the \co{actual    experience}, thus completely forgetting oneself.  But this is seldom an  unconscious process -- one will easily and quite reasonably argue that the  world indeed consists of things, that everywhere we go we will find new  \co{objects}.  I call it a \thi{projection} because I consider it an  \co{illusion}, but the person may be perfectly clear that it is only a  plausible assumption -- worth \thi{projecting} -- even though others may not  share it.} % end of Jungian projections...\pa The juxtaposition of Plotinian remarks on the intellect and the Jungianreflections on the archetypes is, hopefully, self-explaining.\ftnt{A few remarks on  the similarities can be found in \citeauthor*{JungPlotinus}.}  One shouldcertainly remember that Jung and Plotinus diverge drastically when it comes tothe description of the contents of the respective spheres.  While the collectiveunconscious contains only the archetypes of the most primordial elements ofhuman experience, Plotinian intellect suffers overpopulation similar to that ofPlato's ideal world. It contains \citet{qualities, accordant with Nature, and  quantities; number and mass; origins and conditions; all actions and  experiences not against nature; movement and repose, both the universals and  the particulars: but There time is replaced by eternity and space by its  intellectual equivalent, mutual inclusiveness.}{Plotinus}{V:9.10} And this isonly the beginning, because all items listed so far are only forms of sensiblethings.These differences of contents notwithstanding, the similarity of the generalcharacteristics is hardly disputable,\noo{ The emphasized impossibility of  detailed and precise description of any particular contents makes us stop  satisfied with the mere identification of this sphere of Being; we will return  to its more specific treatment in Book III.}% and it is hardly accidental.  Modern sensibility is certainly closer to thelanguage of Jung than to that of neo-Platonic emanations. But, in general, thedifferences concern only the language and concepts. It is easier to recognisesomething fundamental in the dimensions of personal \co{existence} than in theconceptual constructions of \thi{eternal essences}. But what is so recognisedbelongs to \thi{collective unconsciousness}, that is, transpersonalintellect. Every human being lives this eternal sphere anew and individually,everybody is himself only through \co{participation} in the \co{invisible  communion} of \co{shared origin}.   \citetib{Every soul, authentically a soul, has some form of rightness and moral    wisdom; in the souls within ourselves there is true knowing: and these    attributes are no images or copies from the Supreme, as in the sense-world,    but actually are those very originals in a mode peculiar to this    sphere.}{Plotinus}{V:9.13}\noo{For those Beings are not set apart in some    defined place; wherever there is a soul that has risen from body, there too    these are: the world of sense is one -- where, the Intellectual Kosmos is    everywhere.

Even if  particular contents seem to vary (though, being \co{invisible}, one can not  expect them to ever yield to a unique and univocal description), the very  presence and general character of the sphere of \co{invisibles} provides such  an explicatum.\subsubi{Form vs. matter}\label{sub:formMatter}\pa We seem to encounter the distinction between \thi{form} and \thi{matter},perhaps, between the universal \thi{essence} or human nature and its particularinstances in given individuals. The \co{invisibles} could remind of the constantand common characteristics which enter the life only through the \co{actual  experiences}. To the limited extent the association may be legitimate but wecertainly won't accept it in the traditional form.  On the one hand, we havedispensed with any \thi{matter} which could provide the individualising materialfor ideal \thi{forms}. The main difference concerns then the fact that\co{invisibles}, unlike the Platonic \thi{forms}, are not any other-worldlyentities, existing independently beyond the world of \co{concrete experience}.They are fully \co{experienced}, and their \co{transcendence} means only thatthey neither are \co{objects} of \co{actual experiences} nor are reducible tosuch \co{experiences}.  But neither are \co{invisibles} simply abstracted fromthe \co{actual experiences} as their common features, natures or concepts.\co{Actual} instances are usually too few. One cannot be damned twice in one'slife time, just like one cannot commit suicide twice. There is no such thing asmultiple \thi{instances} of love from which one could abstract any meaningful\co{concept}. There is not even \co{any experience} {\em of} love (even ifgrammar and habit allow us to speak this way) -- there is only \co{experiencing}love.\pa Human \co{existence} is indeed a repetition but it is a repetition of theunrepeatable, it is a repetition of the necessity to live one's life, acceptingthis most unique and personal \co{gift}, and to live it from its unique source.\co{Concrete} life does not amount to \thi{filling in} the abstract \thi{form}with actual \thi{matter}, not to mention, with actual sensations. If we were touse these distinctions, we would say that it amounts to actually finding thisvery form, to forming it by drawing the borders -- new or old -- completelyanew. This drawing of the borders is not any \thi{matching} of particularcontents to pre-existing \thi{forms}; it affects equally the \co{visible} andthe \co{invisible} sphere, involving the most intimate reciprocity between them.We can learn (from others, from the books) to understand many things, some\co{distinctions} and borders between hate, love, friendship,indifference\ldots, between hospitality, generosity, magnanimity, benevolence,largesse, lavishness, wastefulness, squander\ldots But to live, it doesnot suffice to \co{actually} know, we must also draw these \co{distinctions}ourselves. To draw such \co{distinctions} amounts to \co{recognition} andclassification of particular \co{actualities} in their terms, as friendly orunfriendly, as an expression of love or not, as an \co{act} of hostility or amere misunderstanding. To live is to \co{recognise actual} situations as\co{signs}. Was his smile, his remark, an expression of understanding, ofsympathy, of irony, of superiority? Answers to such questions (only seldomstated explicitly) are not arbitrary because they arise as theresults of \co{recognising} the \co{actual} events as \co{signs} terminating therespective \co{traces}, which originate in and lead back to the differentiatedbut hardly distinguishable sphere of \co{invisibles}.So far, one might probably still see here only \thi{filling in} the abstract\thi{forms} with particular contents. However, the interesting part only beginshere because there is no \thi{given} and pre-defined way of connecting the twospheres. The way of classifying the \co{actualities} affects also the\co{invisible distinctions} -- not by making them \co{concrete}, because theyalways are so, but by drawing them at some \co{actual} limits, that is, bydrawing them at all. \co{Invisibles} live only through their \co{manifestations}and can be \co{dissociated} from them only by abstracting \co{reflection}. I mayhave a \co{vague} understanding of what friendship means and then, confrontedwith an act of minor opposition or egoism, I conclude: no, if he could do {\em  that}, he can not possibly be my friend, he can not possibly be a friend.There is, fortunately, no recipe-book for drawing such conclusions, and this isan aspect of repeating the unrepeatable. We do not live among shadowy images butin the middle of the highest realities. Saying \wo{friendship} everybody willunderstand (or misunderstand) something, even if we disagree whether thisparticular conclusion, in this particular case was justified. We do not knowwhere the borders go but we must draw them.  Drawing the borders in \co{actual}situations we as if define, again and again, what friendship -- as distinct fromall that it is not -- is.We do not know, that is, we do not know exactly and \co{precisely} whatfriendship is. Yet, without knowing it at all, could we have friends?  After sometime, the friend who did {\em that} and whom I declared not-my-friend, turns outto be the most worthy person whose act followed from the most genuine friendshipor, perhaps, from some particularly restraining circumstances or passingproblems. Even more, I may not only learn about some earlier unknowncircumstances influencing his act but may admit that the act does not actuallycontradict friendship after all, that its significance is (and always hasbeen) much less than what I mistakenly imagined. In either case, heturns out to be, perhaps even to have been all the time, my true friend, andfriendship acquires a new \thi{essence}, the border separating friendship fromall the rest becomes re-adjusted.In this tension between the non-arbitrariness of \co{invisibles} and theconstant need to find their \co{actual signs} lies the whole sphere of\co{concrete} freedom. It is not freedom to decide and declare, but to find and\co{recognise}; for instance, to \co{recognise} friendship and generosity where onecould see and earlier found only enmity and danger. Such \co{recognitions}amount to a genuine, if secondary, creation, but this will be considered in BookIII. \subsub{Transcendence}\wtsep{1. essentially}The \co{transcendence} of \co{invisibles} consists intheir being {\em essentially} \co{non-actual}, {\em essentially} outside the\hoa\ and, by the same token, \co{above me}.  They are what \co{separates}\co{me} from the \co{origin}, the sphere through which \co{I} am \co{confronted}with the ultimate pole of \co{invisibility}, the \co{one}.\wtsep{2. irreducible}\pa\co{Transcendence} does not contradict \co{presence}; essential\co{non-actuality} does not mean any \co{dissociation}, any insurmountableforeignness. It only means inexhaustibility by any \co{objective} determinations,the impossibility of a reduction to \co{visibility}, of being narrowed to the\hoa\ and embraced fully by \co{actual} consciousness.\co{Invisibles} are something which I not only cannot grasp but not even imagineas entities.  Unlike \co{complexes}, they are not constructed from some simpler,\co{actual} elements by the power of my understanding.  Unlike \co{general  thoughts} and \co{qualities of life}, which are always relative to one's life,they are not relative to anybody. Although they are \co{manifested} in one's\co{experience}, they enter it as essentially \co{transcending} its horizon,they enter it but do not appear enclosed {\em within} it.  Sure, they can\co{manifest} to \co{me} something about \co{my life}, but they do it in the\co{absolute} fashion, as something essential and indisputable, they do it from\co{above}.\wtsep{3. empty signs}Irreducibility means also that \co{invisibles} cannot bedelineated by means of any \co{actual} \co{thoughts} and \co{impressions}. \co{General thoughts}, in spite of their \co{vagueness} and empty generality, do havecontent which they partially reflect and ascribe to\co{the world} or one's life.  \co{Invisibles} have no such contentwhich could be meaningfully, even if only partially, \co{reflected}. They are not \thi{properties} of \co{the world}, objective qualities encountered \thi{out there} by \co{reflective} thinking. They are \co{commands} to the individual being, \co{commands} which either are heard -- and that means, heard personally and \co{absolutely} -- or are notencountered at all. Their \co{signs}, seen from the perspective of \co{actuality}, are the mostempty pointers, apparently arbitrary and unrelated to what they pointto.\ftnt{This, by the way, is the character of all kinds of rituals, hymns, Song  of the Songs, love poetry, and the whole vast mystical literature with its  invocations, prayers and poems -- they might be understood as inadequate {\em    expressions} of experiences and attitudes, but not as {\em descriptions} of  whatever they try to praise.}  They are appearances without objects or, asHeidegger might have put it, they appear only (as) disappearing, they become\co{present} without becoming \co{actual} -- \co{distinctions} which immediatelymelt into one another and dissolve in the ever \co{present} \co{rest} of\co{invisibility} surrounding all \co{actuality}.  Their whole and only possibleobjective, \co{actual} determination is to~\ldots \co{manifest} -- to {signify}by pointing towards an inexhaustible source, ever indeterminate and foreverdistinct from all \co{distinctions}.\wtsep{4. non-relative}\pa This complete lack of \co{objective} correlate is an expression of\co{absoluteness}, of \co{transcending} all regions of Being.\noo{ and, eventually,all possible \co{distinctions}.} Belonging to the personal center, to the very\co{self}, \co{invisibles} lie beyond beings but only in the sense of notpertaining to any particular among them -- they pertain to all of them, to thewhole sphere of \co{actual}, non-\co{actual} and \co{non-actual}\co{distinctions}.  A person is not holy \thi{over something} or \thi{in  relation to something} -- he {\em is} holy, nowhere in particular, that is, inhis whole being and beyond it. A person is not damned for a particular \co{act};a particular \co{act} can only reveal the depth of damnation which haspenetrated the person, that is, the whole world, to the outermost limits. One isnot damned temporally, but forever.  \co{Invisibles} penetrate the whole Beingand lend their force and character to every encounter with beings, to every\co{distinction}. Thus they \co{transcend} the limitations of any particularsituation, hiding the \co{virtual} potential of ever new \co{manifestations}, like the promise of eternal repetition.\wtsep{5. atemporal - over-temporal}\pa Lying thus \co{above this world}, \co{invisibles} do not fall under its temporaldimension -- only their \co{manifestations} do.  A bitter, tragic or trivial endof a love story does not mean the end of love.  It is only the end of this\co{manifestation} of love, of this \co{experience}.  Psychological difficultiesnotwithstanding, one may be equally able to cherish love, to longfor its \co{manifestations}, to \co{recognise} and appreciate it when one meetsit again. Psychological difficulties mean only that one tends to lose thisability, not that one cannot retain it. Independence from time can be seen in all kinds of founding events in which asingle \co{manifestation}, a single \thi{moment of truth}, expressed andremembered in some \co{symbolic} form, \co{inspires} all future life (of agroup, a community, a person).  From the archaic ways of establishing the centerof the new settlement -- whether the placement of the totem, of the altar, ofthe temple tent -- as the \la{axis mundi} along which gods intervene into theaffairs of people; through the legendary foundation events, like that of Rome atthe site where divine help had saved Romulus and Remus; to the laicized customof commencing a construction by placing the foundation stone\noo{; and likewise,  an intense moment of silence and quietude, full not of expectations but of the  \co{presence} of love which reveals its eternity to the two people, both  knowing that, although the moment will pass and even dissolve in all kinds of  disappointments which life can bring, so it has announced something  unforgettable, something greater than the intensity of feelings and even their  life} -- \co{symbolic} expressions of the \co{presence} of the higher elementaccompany the events of foundation. This \co{symbolic} reference, byestablishing continuity with the origin, anchors the \co{actual}, temporal eventin the eternal element.  For \co{manifestations} reveal truth which is notaffected by the actual course of \co{this world}.  Even if, at some later time,it loses its \co{actuality} and passes into oblivion, it still has left its markwhich cannot be denied, it revealed something which remains \co{above} time,even if its \co{manifestations} and \co{actual} consequences may diminish ordisappear.\noo{The re-discovery, by people like Eliade and Jung, of the  relevance and \thi{intelligibility} for the modern mind of the religious  symbolism of epochs which are not only past but also seemed for centuries  dead, is a good example.}However, although \co{transcending} thus time, the \co{invisibles} are nottimeless in the way of \co{objects}' which appear as if in a \thi{frozen time},on an abstract scene devoid of change and development.  They are \co{eternal}and time does not contradict \co{eternity} but only, as Plato said, is itsmoving image.\ftnt{\btit{Timaeus}, VII. Strictly speaking, \co{eternity}  pertains only to the \co{absolute}, the ultimate sphere of \co{invisibility},  the \co{confrontation} of the \co{nothingness} of the \co{one} and the  \co{nothingness} of \co{self}; the \co{absolute} contentless {\em fact} of  \co{confrontation}. But higher \co{invisibles} always reveal the \co{aspect}  of \co{eternity} which has nothing to do with the \thi{infinite temporal    duration}, but only with the \co{absolute} validity which \co{transcends}  time as well as space or any other aspects of \co{this world}.}\co{Invisibles} -- \co{manifested} through all \co{actuality}, at the horizonbeyond which it dissolves into \co{nothingness} -- penetrate also time. Theyunveil in the sphere of \co{visibles} the order which remains \co{above} it, butwhich also embraces and enriches everything \co{below}. Every such\co{manifestation} reveals something \co{absolute}, something which is notrelative to any particular person nor any particular region of Being but which,flowing from its \co{origin}, penetrates the whole of it. Every\co{manifestation} of \co{invisibles} reveals their deepest \co{immanence},their involvement in time, their life.\wtsep{6. above me - not subject-object}\pa \co{Transcending this world}, the \co{invisibles} \co{transcend} the sphere of\co{mineness}. They are not only neither \co{subjective} nor \co{objective}, butalso neither \co{mine} nor \co{not-mine}.  In their true \co{manifestations},not involving any \co{object}, they do not involve any \co{subject} either, orrather, they erase the \co{subject}, \ger{<<aufheben>>} it.Of course, they \co{manifest} themselves through \co{me}, through \co{you}. But\co{you} and \co{I} are not indispensable in such \co{manifestations}, we are merely their possible sites. What has been \co{manifested} is notchanged if it happens to be \co{actually} experienced by somebodyelse.One can wish to attain holiness, peace, love and that is about everything onecan do about it.  \co{Invisibles} are not possible goals of any activity, theyare not meaningful intentions of one's \co{will} or \co{acts}. Intendinggoodness one turns into a moralist, intending saintliness one turns into ahypocrite. For intending is relative to \co{myself} and eventually, alltranscendental theories of intentionality notwithstanding, to \co{my will}.\co{Invisibles} can not be acted but can only act, in the background, asimplicit \co{inspirations}.  \co{Participation} in them requires that \co{I} donot consider \co{myself} as the \la{axis mundi}, or else, that \co{I} address\co{myself} only forgetting \co{myself}.For an experience of beauty or love, it is not essential that \co{I} am their\co{subject}.  In a sense, it is enough that they are, that they find place.The \co{subjectivity} of \co{actual} consciousness is merely the one who happensto realise their \co{manifestation}. Creation of a beautiful work of art is avery different experience from its appreciation. But the beholder is given thesame \co{gift} of beauty which was given to the artist, the latter was only theone who \co{actually} happened to bring it to the \co{expression}.\co{Manifestations} concern everything and everybody, they give joy to anybodywho is able to \co{recognise} them as a generous \co{gift}.  \citeti{If you love  a thousand marks which are in your rather than someone else's possession, than  this is not right. [...] If you love your father and mother and yourself more  than you do someone else, then this too is not right.  And if you prefer  blessedness in yourself to blessedness in another, that is not right  either.}{Eckhart, \btit{German Sermons}}{2 Tim. IV:2,5 [\citeauthor*{W}{ 18};  \citeauthor*{LW}{ 30}; \citeauthor*{EckSelected}{ 4\kilde{p.125}}]} Every\co{manifestation} of holiness, of love is accessible to everybody -- it doesnot have to \co{manifest} itself through \co{me} if \co{I} am to find the deeppeace and satisfaction in it, to experience its quality.  It suffices that theyare -- in fact, even if they do not \co{manifest} themselves.\wtsep{7. unlimited = shared, not diminished}\pa\label{pa:shareable}Either there is \co{an experience}, a \co{manifestation} of the \co{invisible}which also makes me see \co{my} subordination to what is \co{above me}, or thereis no such experience.  This is the character of \co{absoluteness} which eitherreveals itself completely or not at all. When revealed, it knows no limits, inparticular, no limits between persons who can \co{participate} in it, or theforms of such a \co{participation}.  It is an inexhaustible potential for evernew \co{manifestations}, a surplus, an untiring force which, fully realised inone situation, never ceases to look for new forms of \co{actualisation}, whichaccessible to one person in one form, does not cease to be accessible to allothers in an unlimited number of other forms.Love without any \co{manifestation} is hardly love, butin any \co{manifestation} and, not least, in any failure, love remains thepotential for new \co{manifestations}.  Therefore it never coincides with its\co{sign} because, fully \co{manifested} as it is, it also immediately overflowsthe \co{actuality} of this \co{manifestation} towards the new ones.  In short, an\co{invisible} is a \co{virtuality}, potentiality of ever new\co{actualisations}. This marriage of \co{immanence} and \co{transcendence}underlies the crucial feature of \co{invisibles} -- they can be genuinely\co{shared}. Just like \co{indistinct} remains unaffected by all the \co{distinctions}, justlike multiplicity of \co{selves} is the primordial \co{communion} of the\co{one}, univocal event of \co{birth}, so \co{invisibles} can be \co{shared}without diminishing.  \co{Actual} goods, \co{objects}, \co{complexes} cannot beso \co{shared}, because sharing them requires some kind of division between allparts which involves diminishing them. (Money is a paradigmatic example but thisapplies to the whole sphere of \co{visibility}.)  The fact that more people\co{participate} in \co{invisible} does not, in any way, diminish its quality,intensity and truth. Love can be shared without any restrictions, even if itsparticular expressions and concrete \co{acts} need to be limited to the\co{actual} context. But an \co{act} of love, in addition to being directed andcircumscribed within the \hoa, has the \co{rest} which is not addressed to anyparticular region of Being. If more people witness to it, it does not lose anyof the love it \co{manifests}; on the contrary, it radiates and allows everybodyto \co{participate} in it.  \citet{All that is begetting in gods, emanates  according to the infinity of divine power multiplying itself and traversing all  beings, and its inexhaustibility manifests itself in particular in emanations  of secondary beings.}{Proclus}{\para 152} An\co{invisible} seed has no quantity -- like the five loaves and two fish whichare enough to feed five thousand people, so an \co{invisible} grain, of the sizeof a mustard seed, is sufficient for any number of people.\noo{ \co{Invisibles} are \co{true} -- not because object and subject coincide,  not because they form some coherent system, but because these categories are  entirely inapplicable, because \co{invisibles} do not ``know'' about \co{me},  do not care about \co{me}.  \citt{Eckhart: I wouldn't ask God to console    me...}{???}    \co{Invisible} can be called \wo{\co{truth}} at least in the sense that \co{I}  find it \co{above me}, as something independent not only from whether it is  \co{me} or somebody else who experiences it, but also from whether it  \co{manifests} itself at all, and whether \co{I} accept it or not.  An  \co{empty symbol} is still a \co{symbol}, \co{I} encounter it with a  \co{vague} feeling that it does, or did, mean something, something which  \co{I} perhaps only want to reject, but still something which in its  \co{vagueness} inspires if not awe then a slight insecurity, in that it  totally escapes \co{my} understanding.    But it is not true in the sense of a necessary truth which must be accepted,  which, threatened by the possibility of not being recognised, invents all  kinds of shrewd or stupid arguments which serve to convince the unbelievers.  Unlike the \co{actual} truths, scientific or merely reasonable, truths about  objects and relations, it does not force its \co{actuality} on \co{me}.  It is  a \co{truth} which allows me to misinterpret it, even to deny it, that is,  which respects \co{me}, \co{my} freedom.  \co{I} can go on living as if it did  not exist, burdened alone -- all alone -- with the consequences of my  rejection.  }\subsub{Self}\label{sec:Self}\noo{ \pa Myths are not, in any case not only and not necessarily, mere  \thi{projections} of the psyche which has not yet reached sufficient level of  consciousness.  Such a view keeps us still locked in the \thi{subjectivity} of  the psyche as opposed to the \thi{objectivity} of the outer world.  They are  genuine \co{expressions} of the unity involved into \co{distinctions} -- of  \thi{body} and \thi{mind}, \thi{matter} and \thi{spirit}, \thi{good} and  \thi{evil}, or whatever other distinctions \co{reflecting} life finds useful  in its dealings with the \co{actual} problems and \co{invisibles}.    Even if, to some extent, light can be taken, as Jung does, as the \co{symbol}  of the emergence of consciousness, its opposition to the darkness of  unconsciousness rests on the purely psychological, that is, personally  accidental, opposition conscious-unconscious -- what is conscious and what  unconscious is, after all, a pretty private matter of each individual.  What  is \co{visible} and what \co{invisible}, on the other hand, is a much more  fundamental matter of Being, and Jung's greatest achievement is the  identification of the sphere of the \thi{collective} archetypes which quite  unnecessarily has been coupled with \thi{unconscious}.  There is more to the  symbolism of light and darkness than mere psychology of a confused mind  trapped in the ethos of \co{visibility}.  The \co{invisible} which \co{founds}  the emergence of \co{actual reflection} is darkness only as long as one denies  its \co{presence}.  \citeti{The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness    has not understood it.}{John I:5 [\citf{Light is thrown on all the lie of      your being, We can move only in its shadow.}{Salomon ben Jahuda Gabirol,      {\em The Royal Crown}:Niflaim \citaft{Heilige}{ V;p.41}}]} In  fact, it is the \thi{light} of consciousness which may function as darkness or  the darkening element.  \citeti{The eye is the lamp of the body.  If your eyes    are good, your whole body will be full of light.  But if your eyes are bad,    your whole body will be full of darkness.

XI:34} To a  mature and \co{open reflection} the \co{invisible} is the very source of light  and ultimate \co{clarity}.  \co{Reflection} can live meaningfully only in this  light, for the mere light of conscious oppositions, the mere strife for  \co{more} consciousness, can make things \co{visible} only by  \co{dissociating} them, perhaps, by putting them together again in  \thi{understanding}, but eventually just making them meaningless.Just like the important thing is not to realise that one is an immoralbastard but to cease being one, not to realise that one is mistakenand confused but to find the right way (for which purposes becomingconscious may be at best a means), the clue is not to expandconsciousness but to make right use of it.}\pa Extensive empirical studies leading to the identification of somearchetypical patterns, did not provide sufficient grounds for Jung to concludethe presence \citet{in the unconscious [of] an order equivalent to that of the  ego.  It certainly does not look as if we were likely to discover an  unconscious ego-personality. [...]  Personality need not imply consciousness.  It can just as easily be dormant or dreaming.}{JungArche}{VI:503/508} Indeed,\citetib{consciousness succumbs all too easily to unconscious influences and  these are often truer and wiser than our conscious  thinking.}{JungArche}{VI:504} This unconscious center, or rather, since nocenter can be discerned there, the hidden source of personality is what Jungcalls \wo{self}.  Its phenomenology in the symbols of \thi{wholeness}, inparticular mandalas, occupy a significant part of Jung's investigations which itis certainly not the place to review here.  We would denote all this concretematerial as \co{my self}.  As opposed to it, \co{self} is entirely contentlessand, as long as \co{my self manifests} itself, the \co{self} remains hiddenbeyond and \co{above} these manifestations.  \co{Self} is the ultimate, {\em  essentially} \co{invisible} source which, \co{manifesting} itself only as \co{my  self}, remains always \co{above} it without slightest traces of similarity tothe \thi{ego-personality} -- the archetype of archetypes, the contentless limitof all relative \co{distinctions} facing only the \co{absolute} \co{indistinct}.As Ricour says, \co{self} can be apprehended only through \thi{text}. If weforget the hermeneutic bias towards the \thi{text} and interpret it liberally as\co{symbolic} expressions, also experienced \co{commands}, then the intuitionseems to be the same: the \co{signs} of \co{self}, by their very nature,indicate \co{distance} to their \co{origin}, they \co{manifest} withoutrevealing.\noo{any substantial \thi{essence}.}  \co{Self} \co{manifests} itselfbut is itself never reducible to such \co{actual manifestations}.  Its\co{signs} reveal only, so to speak, its \thi{consequences}, \co{commands},\co{inspirations} -- not any definable \thi{properties} of the \co{self} itself.Its \co{manifestation} \citet{is a kind of understanding and perception of our  self, in which we must be very careful lest, wishing to perceive more, we do  not stray away from our Self.}{Plotinus}{V:8, 11, 23-24.} Plotinus refershere to the understanding in the moments of ecstatic union but it applies moregenerally.  Of course, the experiences of mystical union are, too, examples ofthe \co{signs} of \co{invisible self}.

Just like thecoherence and relative consistency of my \co{ego} and my \co{acts} are groundedin the unity of \co{my life}, so the unity of \co{myself}, of \co{my world} and\co{my life}, is grounded in the \co{invisible} and \co{indistinct origin}, inthe \co{self confronting one}. \co{Self} is the point in infinity, the\co{nothingness} of a point reflecting the \co{nothingness} of the \co{one}, it\citeti{has neither a past nor a future, and it is not something to which  anything can be added, for it cannot become larger or smaller.}  {Eckhart,  \btit{German Sermons}}{ Mt.

We have opposed all talk about metaphysicalsubstances with respect to the \co{visible} or material things. But Aristotleand his followers always included living beings among the primary substances,and here our characteristics of \co{self} may comply with those of a substance.\co{Self} is independent in the sense of being completely non-relative; simpleand indivisible in the sense of being \co{above} all \co{visible distinctions};timeless and unchangeable in the sense of facing only the \co{absolute}.\citet{The \co{self} is always the same,\lin Already fulfilled,\lin Without flaw  or choice or striving.\lin Close at hand,\lin But boundless.}{Ash}{XVIII:5}Such descriptions can also be applied to the \co{one} which would then appear asthe ultimate substance, but we will return to some differences below in\ref{sub:SelfOne}.\subsubi{Self vs. My Self}\pa\label{pa:dissociateUp} We have noticed the difference between \co{self} and\co{my self}.  \co{Self} is initially experienced as merely \thi{inborn  possibility}; \co{I} can recognise the sphere of \co{invisibles} centeredaround the \co{self} and \co{manifested} through \co{symbols} and \co{commands}-- addressed to \co{me} but coming from \co{above} any sphere of \co{my}personality.  At the same time, \co{I} also meet empty \co{symbols}, in texts,art, other people's relations, which \co{I} recognise as only possible\co{manifestations} of \co{invisibles}, as ones which do not appeal to \co{me};\co{symbols} which relate some \co{invisible} story but a story which is not\co{mine}, which does not exercise the same \co{commanding} power as the\co{symbols} encountered in \co{my} personal experience.One might want to extrapolate the obvious difference between such\co{experiences} to a genuine opposition between their origin(s).  One may, andnaturally one easily does, maintain the distinction \co{mine} vs.\co{not-mine}, constitutive for the level of \co{mineness}, also with respect tothe \co{invisible} things of the \co{other world}.  Approaching the \co{self},\co{I} can experience it as \co{mine}, as {\em exclusively} \co{mine}.  But suchform of \co{an experience} results from propagating \thi{upwards} the\co{reflective dissociations}. It is grounded in the \co{attachment} to therelativity of \co{actual} consciousness which insists on the categories of\co{mineness} and \co{myself} \co{dissociated} from \co{not-mine}.  Talkingabout \co{my self}, one tends to assume such a distinction at the level of the\co{invisibles} as if \co{my invisible self} was opposed to a multiplicity ofothers.  This, however, is to confuse \co{myself} and \co{my self}.  It is toapply the categories of \co{actual dissociations} and oppositions pertaining to\co{this visible world}, to the \co{invisible} world which does not offergrounds for such distinctions.  \co{Self} is \co{separated} only from the\co{one} -- this is its true and only counterpart.\noo{The symbols of protective spirit or one's soul, like \la{Ba-soul} (Egypt),  \gre{daimon} (Greeks), \thi{genius} (Romans), bush-soul (more primitive),  Great Man (Naskapi) }Everything else, every other \co{distinction} is \co{below} it and thus can be,at least in principle, incorporated into it. The \thi{\co{my}} in \co{my self}is only \co{my} experience of the \co{self}.  \co{My self} is \co{self}experienced as \co{mine}, that is, in so far as the \co{commands} and\co{symbols} are received with all their obliging force by \co{myself}, or else,in so far as they actually, even if not consciously, exercise their directingforce on \co{my} being, also while this being is involved in the opposition to\co{not-mine}.\thesisnonr{\co{My self} is \co{my} experience of the \co{self}.\label{th:mySelfmyexpirience}}\co{My self} is \co{self} seen through the veil of \co{mineness}, even of\co{ego} and pure \co{subjectivity}, in short, it is \co{self} in so far as itis seen.  The \co{commands} address \co{myself}, and thus they turn \co{self}into \co{my self}, but they do not originate in \co{myself}, they emerge fromthe ultimate \co{origin} and mark the ever \co{present} \co{trace} of \co{birth}-- \co{self}.  This \co{trace}, \la{haecceitas}, has no principle ofindividuation beyond the fact of \co{birth}.  In terms of our figure inI:\refp{pa:stages}, p.\pageref{fi:stages}, \co{self} is the point of \co{birth},the pole \co{above} all \co{distinctions} which, as the point in infinity, isonly reflection of the \co{one} -- the spark of the soul, as Eckhart would sayor, perhaps, the \thi{seminal reason}, \la{logos spermatikos} which (borrowedfrom the Stoics) is, according to Justin Martyr, \citet{implanted in every race  of men [as if] part only of the Word [...]\noo{who is in every    man.}}{Martyr}{8\noo{/10}\kilde{Powrot,p.171}} \co{Self} is \co{present}beyond and irrespectively of any \co{experiences}, in particular, any\co{experiences} of \co{my self}, not to mention, of \co{myself}.%wanted to say: there are no experienceS of Self, only experience of Self -- %underneath all experiences\pa\label{pa:multipleSelf} As the \co{trace} of \co{birth}, the contentlesspoint in infinity, one \co{self} is indistinguishable from others.  One point ininfinity is essentially the same as another -- they are only numericallydistinct.  This contentless difference of \co{selves} reflects the fundamentalcharacter of \co{birth} as the purely ontological event -- it does not involve,as yet, any particular \co{distinctions} but only this \co{pure} one.  Different\co{selves} are only \co{traces} of different \co{births}, of \co{separations}which established distinct poles of the same \co{confrontation} with the\co{one}.  Thus one \co{self} is not opposed to other \co{selves}. All are\co{traces} of -- all \co{share} in -- exactly the same primordial event of\co{birth} and \co{confrontation} with \co{one}. The numerical distinctions andmultiplicity of \co{selves} is thus a thorough \co{community} of \co{sharing}the same primordial event.\co{Self} is the simple fact of \co{existence}, and hence it can not bedissociated from \co{concrete existence}, not to mention positing it as anyself-subsistent entity. As such, one \co{self} is essentially the same as anyother -- they are only numerically distinct. Yet the difference, if one insists,between one \co{self} and another is just the difference between one\co{existence} and another, is the difference between one way (of \co{existing})and another, which is eventually the difference between one person and another,between \co{me}, \co{you}, \co{him}. These differences do not in any waycontradict the genuine \co{community}, but this will be discussed more closelyin Book III:\refpf{pa:communion}.\subsubi{The \thi{sense of self}}\pa\label{asymSelf} \co{I} am \co{my self}, \co{my self} is \co{self},\la{atman} is \la{Atman}, but as we said in I:\ref{asymm}, \thi{being} isasymmetric and none of these can be reversed. \co{Self} is not \co{my self} and\co{my self} is not \co{myself}. In particular, {\em being} \co{self} is notdependent on any feeling or \thi{sense of self}.  The \co{experience} of the\co{self} is not \co{an experience} of any given identity {\em with} the\co{self}.  \co{Self} is \co{above} \co{me}, \thi{greater than} \co{me}, it isnever \thi{given} in any \co{actual experience} and hence is not reducible toany personal sense of being \co{oneself}. But at the same time, it is also thesource and the ultimate site of \co{my} \co{unity}.We may want to ascribe to schizophrenics double personality. And this may be thecase, although it means that we have formed the notion of personality allowingfor such a multiplicity in {\em one} person. It may, however, seem that a schizophrenicsuffers exactly because he retains the \thi{sense of self}, because he noticesterrifying elements invading {\em his} being, because he becomes afraid about\co{himself} and finds a temporal calm in alluding -- perhaps in an escapist way-- to \co{his self}.  People suffering from the Korsakoff syndrome seem to havelost the hold over personal memories and the continuity of their being seemsreduced to only the most immediate, last minute's past. However, they alsopreserve some childhood and adolescent memories which indicate that thereduction is not that total. But even if it were, even if the \thi{sense of  self} and continuity disappeared completely, we still would be dealing with{\em the same} person. If such a person is our friend or loved one, we will tryto help {\em him} -- he is no longer \co{himself} as he used to be, perhaps, heno longer has the \thi{sense of self}, that is, of \co{himself}, but he is stillthe same person, the same \co{self}.\ftnt{Certainly, forensic considerations may  call for a more specific notion of a person, or rather of a legal subject, but  we are not dealing with such issues.}  And when we find out that nothing canbe done, we grieve over {\em this} person, over our loss of {\em him} and over{\em his} loss of \co{himself}.Saying about somebody \wo{He is another person}, we always know that he is thesame; he only behaves, acts, speaks in a way which is not his usual way.Perhaps, he has even changed completely, he acquired a new personality, due tosome mystical experiences, intense work on himself, some personal tragedy.  Buthe {\em is the same} person, even if completely different.  The same applies toa person who has completely lost his memory, who does not any longer \thi{know  who he is}, to one with a severe dissociative disorder,\noo{ (like dissociativeamnesia, or identity disorder, called also \wo{multiple personality}),} to anunconscious person kept alive under a drip.  If this person is my loved one, Iwill care and treat him with all consideration and patience which I owe him --because he {\em is the same person}.  When we respect the decisions written inthe last will of a deceased person, we do it from respect for {\em this} veryperson -- this person remains himself, is still identical to himself, even whendead.  Hmmm\ldotsThus, not only no two persons are identical, the same person can be vastlydifferent from oneself.  Just like it is not any \co{externally} perceived,observable distinguishability which constitutes identity of a person, so it isnot either any \thi{inner sense of self}.  If we feel insecure, we may need somecriteria to {\em convince ourselves} that the person is the one he says he is,that he is not a spy, that my friend who just went out is the same who is nowcoming back, that my wife today is the same person as yesterday, even, that I amtoday the same person as I was yesterday.  If we feelinsecure\ldots or, perhaps, if we suffer from the Capgras syndrome.\ftnt{Capgras  syndrome makes the affected person believe that some close friend or relative has been replaced by a deceiver or an \la{alter  ego}. This conviction persists even though one can still recognise all theusual signs -- the face, the body, the behavior, etc. -- of the other.} But what wethus convince ourselves {\em about} is something different than the mereconformance to any universal criteria.  What is it?  Where does the idea of {\em  it} come from, if criteria are only to confirm {\em it}?  The \co{unity} of aperson lies beyond any tests and the variations in the possible criteria are asnumerous as the number of different people.\pa\label{noselfsense} The asymmetry of \thi{being} in general, and of being \co{self} in particular, %\refp{asymSelf},expresses irreducibility of higher levels to the lower ones. But also, thehigher level, the more \co{virtuality}.  \co{Self}, the \co{trace} of \co{birth}, isthe ultimate ontological site.  But as we have described in Book I, it is a\co{virtual} site which exists only through the levels of \co{my self},\co{myself}, \co{ego} and \co{acts} of the \co{actual subject}.  That is, thereis no such thing as \co{self} \thi{in itself}, a metaphysical subject without\co{concrete} realisation in the world; all levels are co-existent andco-extensional. We are not four separate souls, but one, for it is not \citet{a  diversity of parts -- if we have to assert that it has parts -- which is  distinguished in the soul, but a variety of functions and  movements.}{Periphyseon}{IV:787B\kilde{[p.111]}  The levels of human being according to Eriugena (or many  later Scholastics following Aristotle), namely, Intellect, Reason, Interior  Sense and Body, can be  easily recognised in our levels. \citef{Of course,    everything which arrives at reason from the secret recesses of nature approaches through the action of intellect. Then that same art, as thoughin a second descent, goes from reason to memory and gradually reveals itselfmore clearly in \la{phantasiae} as though in certain forms. By a third descentit is next diffused to the corporeal senses where, by sensible symbols, itdivulges its power through genera, species, and all its divisions, subdivisions,and distributions.}{Periphy}{III;p.172} The divisions of nature from thetitle of Eriugena's work, referred typically only to the four rather abstract species(\citefib{that which creates and is not created, that which is created and also  creates, that which is created and does not create, and the fourth which  neither creates nor is created}{Periphyseon}{I:1}), find here most concreteexpression.} A loss at a lower level need not mean a similar loss at the higher level. One'sincoherent or inconsistent \co{acts} can witness to some disturbances in one's\co{ego} but they, unless all too frequent and grave, need not contradict thelatter's integrity. Similarly, suffering an inflation of \co{ego} can as easilylead to problems in one's social interactions as to a realisation of deeperaspects of \co{oneself}. One can lose \co{oneself}, which we would typicallyequate with the loss of the \thi{sense of \co{oneself}}, an existential crisesor a personality disorder. But this does not mean that one has lost \co{self},that one ceased to be \co{self}, because this is impossible.Identification of \co{self} with the \thi{sense of self} is a sad reductionism,a psychologism of extreme \co{subjectivity}.  The \thi{sense of self} (which, toavoid all too detailed distinctions and lengthy exposition, we do notdistinguish from the \thi{sense} of continuity or of unity) is not somethingwhich establishes \co{self}.  On the contrary, it is possible to have such a\thi{sense} only because there is something {\em of which} this is a sense.Eventually, it is the sense of the \co{absolute} validity and uniqueness of thefundamental event -- \co{confrontation} with the ultimate \co{transcendence} ofthe \co{one} -- which establishes \la{haecceitas} and whose \co{traces found}all the lower modifications of selfhood like personality, \co{ego},\co{subjectivity}.\subsubi{A note on scattered consciousness and self}\pa Personal \co{unity} is constituted at \co{birth} as the fundamentalontological fact.  No complete \co{visible} account of it can ever be given.What we have seen in this Book is the stratification of personal being intolevels which, relatively, may be taken as various levels of personal unity.Accordingly, \co{I} can experience being more or less {myself}.  Accepting\co{self} \co{above} any particular \co{experiences} of \co{my self}, {I} reachthe most ultimate and definite \co{unity}.  If {I} stay \co{attached} to\co{myself}, this \co{invisible unity} slips all the time from \co{my} attemptsto {\em see} it and appears as a merely noumenal identity -- identityirreducible to and unaccountable for in the \co{visible} terms of \co{mineness}and of the \thi{sense of self} but which, nevertheless, remains all the timeunquestionable.  Engaged exclusively in \co{my ego}, {I} become a confusedcollection of traits, features, functions and inclinations.  And finally, tryingto account for \co{myself} in terms of \co{immediacy}, {I} become a pure\co{subject}, entirely depersonalised \co{act} of \co{immediate} reactions, asspontaneous as indifferent because \co{external}.\pa The more we narrow the temporal scope of attention and the more\co{objective} we try to be in inquiring into the nature of the \thi{subject},the less we find of any subject.  Humean series of impressions providean obvious example, and so does Locke's person who, eventually, seems to becomemerely a \wo{forensic term}.Yet, \citet{we perceive it so plainly and so certainly, that it neither needs  nor is capable of any proof.}{LockUnd}{IV:9.3} The awareness of personal unitymakes it hard to accept the attempts to dissolve \co{self} in a flux of\co{actualities}. \woo{Guess what: everybody was wrong: there never was such a  thing as the self [...]}{Rorty, ???} Certainly, there never was such a {\em  thing}.  But one still says, for instance, that \wo{self is the center of  narrative strategies} or of \woo{narrative gravity.}{Dennett: The Self as}What center? Why does one find it appropriate to use this inappropriate word?Or, perhaps, \wo{self is nothing more than a nominal handle we stick on the  thread of continuity that seems to wind through our lifetime}. No matter howmuch one would like to dissolve self in nominalistic arbitrariness ofpost-modern or neo-pragmatic cacophony, one keeps trying to justify the use ofthe \thi{handles} and to describe on {\em what} they \thi{get stuck} with the\thi{seeming continuity}. Words do create things because they solidify limits of\co{distinctions}. But this does not mean that the \co{distinctions} arearbitrary, merely \thi{subjective} or \thi{unreal}.  Denying the \thi{reality}of the \co{self} because it evades every determination and every \co{actual}description, may be (in certain circles) motivated by sociological observationsand preoccupation with cultural abstractions and generalisations, but it carriesalways the germ of empirical arguments, not to mention the intellectualambiguity of (self-)alienation and (self-)satisfaction.\pa The \thi{sense of continuity}, not to mention any real continuity itself, isas perplexing for today's empiricists as it was for Hume. His famous argumentshows, indeed, that \co{self} can not be accounted for in terms of scattered\co{actual} \thi{perceptions and ideas}; no such events reveal \co{self}, evenif some might \co{manifest} its \co{presence} -- the \co{presence}, however,which for ever \co{transcends} the \hoa.  As \wo{there is no impression constant  and invariable}, and so none which could give rise to the idea of \co{self},there are two possibilities: either stick to the method which tells us that onlyimpressions and perceptions matter, or look for \co{self} somewhere else.According to the former, people \citet{are nothing but a bundle or collection of  different perceptions}{Hume}{I:4.6} -- OK, but why do one need to use thewords like \wo{bundle} or \wo{collection}, when no unity is there? What or whereis the boundary separating one such collection from another? For something makesit a \thi{collection}, this \thi{collection} as opposed to another one. Weprefer to see in the inability to {\em see} any \co{self} not any proof of itsnon-existence but simply the limitation of the \co{actual} ability to see -- itdoes not imply that \co{self} does not exist but only that if it does then it is\co{invisible}.The attempts to bring \co{sign} and signified into an ultimate identity, toconflate action with reaction, lead nowadays naturally to the \co{complex} ofthe brain composed of independent though intricately networked neurons and tothe binary minuteness of their firings.  As the theory of consciousness,this amounts to postulating a \thi{multiplicity of Is}, one \thi{I} responsiblefor every minute reaction and bunch of such \thi{Is}, each working in its owndirection, \thi{competing} with each other for creating an overall, unified,conscious experience and, in the confused cases of self-deception, of qualia.Consciousness thus explained seems to say \wo{We react, therefore we are}.  Thisaccount of Dennett's goes back to James' theory according to which consciousnessis not any entity but a function.  It has never been entirely clear {\em of  what} this is a function, but since consciousness is not any entity in ouraccount either, we should perhaps grant it some attention.\pa Such a view certainly squares well with the cases of dissociative personalitydisorders, some forms of schizophrenia, and the like.  Indeed, mental sicknesscan manifest itself as a dissolution of the \thi{sense of personal unity} and afall to the level of \co{dissociated} impressions and sensations.  But does thefact that self can be dissolved mean that it does not (or did not) exist?  It islike saying that, since this building {\em could} be destroyed, it is not real. But\co{self} is beyond and \co{above} any \thi{sense of self} -- \co{I}may lose \co{myself}, \co{my} \thi{sense of self}, but this does not dissolve\co{self}. For \co{self} is not a thing which can be lost, not a place which canbe left -- it is the very fact of \co{my} existence.Consciousness is a pure \co{actuality} which culminates in \co{reflective}splitting of all contents into \co{dissociated} entities.  Sufficient\co{dissociation} leads almost inevitably to \co{positing} a \co{totality} ofall the bits and pieces which became completely unrelated.  Also \co{subject} (or\co{object}) is not any metaphysical substance of its own -- it is just an\co{aspect} (function?) of \co{actual experience}.  But, and this is the crucial\thi{but}, even for a declared empiricist this can be only the beginning of thestory -- a deep sense of unity, at least in most normal and healthy persons, isso obvious that one need to try to account for this, too.\pa Simplifying only slightly, it should not make much difference which accountof this kind we consider.\noo{Since Hume's, or Dennett's, hobbies with labeling  things \wo{real} and \wo{unreal} do not seem to deserve much attention, I will  take a more serious person.} James says: \citet{Experience, I believe, has no  such inner duplicity [subject-object]; and the separation of it into  consciousness and content comes, not by way of subtraction, but by way of  addition -- the addition, to a concrete piece of it, other sets of experiences  [\ldots].}{Radical}{I:2 (The \wo{subtraction} refers to the conviction that  \thi{pure experience} happens to a dual element of consciousness, so that one  can be obtained only by \thi{subtracting} the other.)} So far, so good; our\co{experience} does not happen within a sharp duality of\co{subject}-\co{object} either.  But then, consciousness is merely oneexperience looking at another, it is a relation between separate experiences:\citetib{a given undivided portion of experience, taken in one context of  associates, play[s] the part of a knower, of a state of mind, of  \thi{consciousness}; while in a different context the same undivided bit of  experience plays the part of a thing known, of an objective  \thi{content}.}{Radical}{I:2} The crucial phrase here is \wo{the undivided  portion of experience}, the beloved \thi{given}, \thi{atom}.  What constitutesa part of experience as such an \thi{undivided portion} is not an appropriatequestion -- this is just the way things are, this is how we experience: one\thi{undivided portion} after another.  \citetib{The instant field of the  present is at all times what I call the \thi{pure} experience.  It is only  virtually or potentially either object or subject as yet.  For the time being,  it is plain, unqualified actuality, or existence, a simple {\em    that}.}{Radical}{I:2} The \co{actuality}, now explicit as \thi{the instant  field of the present}, creeps irresistibly into the language, whether of anempiricist or phenomenologist.  It is ignored, however, because it functions allthe time as the silent assumption.  Consciousness, or what seems to be the samehere, subject, emerges as a relation between such \thi{presents}.But \co{actuality}, and hence all \co{actual experiences}, are something whichhappen at the end, not at the beginning. \co{Actuality} emerges from a series ofhypostases as a final result. This final result is the beginning only for all\co{reflection} and \co{actual} considerations.  Consciousness, or its germ\co{awareness}, is an \co{aspect} of the \nexus\ of \co{actual} \thi{undivided  bit of experience}, not something which is built on top of such\co{actualities}.  There is no \co{actuality}, no \thi{undivided portion of  experience} without being in which, by which, or for which it has beendistinguished as such a portion. This distinguishing, this split between the\co{actual} and non-\co{actual}, is this being's consciousness,I:\refp{pa:objects}.  \noo{ The definite \co{dissociation} of \co{subject} and  \co{object} does not happen at the level of \thi{pure experience}. But this  phrase with us does not refer to \co{an actual experience}, which being  \co{cut} out of the horizon has already introduced \co{actual subject}, but  rather to the field of \co{experience}, differentiated and \co{recognised} but  as yet not \co{reflectively dissociated}.  }\pa A significant consequence of the just quoted view is that consciousnessbecomes necessarily and only a retrospective act directed towards an earlier\thi{pure experience} \citetib{and the doubling of it in retrospection into a  state of mind and a reality intended thereby, is just one of the  acts.}{Radical}{I:2} But now we are obviously speaking about our\co{reflection} which, indeed, always comes \co{after}.The usual confusion of \co{awareness} and \co{reflection}, under the commonheading of consciousness, makes its work here forcing consciousness to be alwaysonly consciousness of some past.  This, as we saw, is characteristic for\co{reflection} -- the \co{after} is but the form of the distance separating\co{subject} from \co{object}.  But we would not, for this reason, call\co{experience} \wo{unconscious}.  Even if it does not involve \co{reflective  dissociation} of \co{subject} and \co{object}, it does involve \co{awareness}which is its very life; it is only because I am constantly \co{aware} of what isgoing on that, at some moment, I can stop and \co{reflect} over it.\co{Awareness}, however, is for the most a subconscious and non-intentionalprocess, which for James might easily mean: unexperienced.\ftnt{This, of course,  is a simplification since James was well aware of the importance of  subconsciousness. But it is not clear how this affects his notion of  experience and, in particular, of the pure present.}\noo{quote Fichte\ldots: You are pricking ME!}Furthermore, we can ask what makes me, i.e., {\em this} \co{actual} experience,look at an experience from yesterday as equally \co{my} experience?  Sure, thereis some sense of continuity which, too, is an aspect of {\em this} experience.I, {\em this} experience, seems thus to posit an \thi{I} as a subject also ofthis past experience.  Projection, I guess.  By analogy?  But I was not therethen, {\em that} experience had no subject, which is only projected back fromthe \co{actuality} of {\em this} experience.\pa One can certainly try to connect further and further, but we won't.  What wepossibly might get in this way is an \co{ego}, a collection of \co{actualities},mostly conscious ones, which may be considered as \co{mine} but are never\co{myself}.  The \co{unity} escapes, as always, the empirical\co{dissociations} and can be only attempted reconstructed as a mere\co{totality}.  The intimate relations between the pieces (aptly observed byJames as conjunctive relations) are still only relations between separatepieces.  The very \thi{feeling, or experience of continuity} remains a fact buta fact without any reason or, to put it as a pragmaticist would like, withoutany goal or function.  What is a possible pragmatic goal of projecting \thi{I}on past experiences?  Forensic aspects hardly get involved at this level ofconsiderations.  Consciousness is thus a function (of what?)  which itself hasno purposeful function, which merely adds to the \co{actual} experiences, andalways only past ones, a redundant feeling of having a subject which, by theway, comes always only \la{post factum} to have a retrospective look.\noo{Sure, one may imagine countless ways of explaining that, after all, it does  have some function. Such explanations will be typically based again on the  confusion of \co{awareness} with \co{reflection}. Let's only remark that the  most prominent among such functions would probably be to establish (or account  for?)  the very \co{totality}, the sense of all experiences being connected  and mutually related.  I still do not know what the possible purpose of such a  function would be, but let it go.  This relatedness, perhaps unity, however,  was given already in the \thi{sense of continuity}.  So, perhaps,  consciousness is nothing but this very \thi{sense}?  Perhaps.  The question  then would be whether such a conscious experience reveals something beyond its  \co{actual} content or not, whether this unity is only an aspect of this and  similar experiences or else whether it obtains also when consciousness does  not accompany the experience. You know my answer, so we may stop here.  }The empirical bias, from Democritus to Hume, James and later, can hardly admitany unity beyond \co{actual experiences}.  From the \co{objectivistic}perspective -- at the level of \co{actuality} -- there is no such thing as the unity of a person; there is at most the unity of an \co{act}.  The empiricist'screed -- whatever can be \co{distinguished} must be \co{dissociated}, because itis independent -- with the accompanying {ontology} of exclusive \thi{reality} ofindivisible \thi{atoms} can not, if carried consequently, accept almost anythingas \thi{real}.  The multiplicity of Is, minute, preferably determinableentities, is a natural, indeed, the only possible, counterpart of this\thi{atomicity}.  It seems to enter the stage for no apparent reason, for ifeverything is obtained from dissociated experiences, what is the need for any\thi{I}?  Well, it does not enter the stage -- it sneaks in.  Dennett, to takeanother example, seems to distribute the labels \wo{real} and \wo{unreal}according to the following principle: to be \thi{real}, an $x$ must bedeterminate, and determinate means that it is decidable whether something is $x$or not.\ftnt{The precise bivalence of the non-contradiction principle (often  quoted where excluded middle does the real job) as the ultimate criterion of  \thi{reality} is but another side of this view. Since self is underdetermined  (or even may seem to possess contradictory characteristics), just like are the  characters fabricated in the novels, both are equally fictional -- at least,  according to \citeauthor*{DennSelf,DennConsc}, and other writings of this  author.} \wo{It is determinate, decidable} is a misleading depersonalisationof the event -- {\em we and only we}, you and I, are the ones who must be ableto determine and decide.\noo{\co{Actuality} is the horizon of \co{reflection},  which means, \co{objectivity} is inseparable from \co{subjectivity}.}Attempts to reduce everything to the \co{objective actuality} of the givens, endup in most intimate, if only confused, associations with \co{subject},consciousness, \thi{mind}, or whatever is the current sign of the sphere\co{transcending} the obviousness of the \co{immediate}.  The empiricist isthere all the time, experiencing, determining, deciding, and nothing helpsgetting rid of {\em himself}.  Usually, he reaches his limit when the\thi{atoms} begin to slip out of his view, when the well, from the bottom ofwhich he hopes to dig out the \thi{atoms}, begins to seem \ldots bottomless.But this is only another side of the fact that his \thi{atoms}, his\thi{reality} are but a function of this view; not necessarily of any voluntarydecisions but of his sensuous, perceptive, reflective, differentiatingmechanisms which furnish the \co{distinctions} necessary for arriving at any\thi{atoms} in the first place.  Here, past the bottom of the well, in around-about way and with all possible reservations, we can join him.\pa The intention was not to dismiss the attempts to establish consciousness asa conspiracy of cells on the empirical basis.  Such attempts, as any others ofthe sort, may be worth pursuing. On the one hand, such a reductionism is theform of all science\noo{(in the strict sense)} and, on the other hand, they maysuggest, though never demonstrate, which aspects are not amenable to\co{objectivistic} reduction. Even if they ever reached the goal, it would be ofa merely scientific relevance and would hardly affect the way in which onecomports oneself, consciously or not, to one's experience.  Even if they managedto construct an imitation of \co{ego} from bits and pieces, this would hardly beeven the first step in giving an account of the \co{I} and its relation to theworld.  For consciousness (whether \co{awareness} or \co{reflection}) is only anaccident of \co{myself}, is only \co{actuality} of \co{myself}, alwaysinterwoven into the texture of \co{my} whole being and stretching all the way tothe ultimacy of the \co{self}, the \co{invisibility} of the\co{origin}.\ftnt{Attempts to (re)construct consciousness provide an example of  the ever present project of \gre{mimesis}, the driving force of  \co{reflection} (whether in art, science or technology) trying to regain the  object it has \co{dissociated} from others and from itself. In early days of  AI it has reached the ambitions of recreating human intelligence   by means of formal manipulation of symbolic representations.  The inadequacy of the project became quickly apparent as information required  for controlling even simplest tasks, like walking the stairs or avoiding  obstacles, proved impossibly complex. The later projects of the nature-based  AI resolve (some of) such difficulties by renouncing explicit models and  designing systems of purely reactive components, where the sheer organisation  -- without any explicit modeling -- allows robots move in real environment  successfully avoiding obstacles (e.g., neural networks, subsumption  architectures in robotics, \citeauthor*{SubsumeA,SubsumeB,SubsumeC}.) Of  course, renouncing representation one loses the possibility of treating the  factors which are not immediately given.% except those which are hard-wired in the structure.  But one might see in this development -- admitting that purposeful behaviour  does not necessarily require explicit model and representation -- an  expression of the fact (if not the insight) that there is no such thing as  \thi{pure intelligence}, \thi{consciousness in-itself}; that whatever thinking  is, is inseparable from the being (nature) which thinks; even though one has  not yet said that to create human intelligence, consciousness, etc.  one has  to create a human being. Leaving such projects to doctors Frankenstein, we  could perhaps observe that there is a very old, efficient and even pleasant  (though hardly \co{reflective}) way of \thi{creating copies} of human beings.}\subsubi{Source of unity}%\pa The question how the unity of \co{myself} arises from the multiplicity of\thi{perceptions}, \thi{impressions}, or \thi{ideas} is as irresolvable on thebasis of \co{reflection}, as is the question about this unity arising from aninterplay of various areas of brain, from a conspiracy of cells, patterns offiring neurons, etc. It is irresolvable because it arises from the antinomicattempt to reduce the experienced -- and yes!  known -- \co{invisible unity} tothe \co{objective} categories. The best it can do is to search for someprinciple of consistency, reason for cooperation, \co{visible} explanationof\ldots the \thi{sense of self}. This sense, like any other sense, may havevarious explanations which never touch the issue.  For personal \co{unity}precedes \co{reflection} and \co{founds} the latter's unity: {I} am the samebeing not only in any particular moment of \co{self-reflective attention}, butalso through all the day, whole two weeks in Prague, all my life.  This\co{unity} is not an identity constructed from smaller, more manageable pieces.It is ontologically \co{founded} by \co{birth} -- the primordial event of\co{separation} -- which precedes any other \co{distinctions}.  And havinghappened \thi{up there}, \la{in illo tempore}, against the background of\co{nothingness}, it remains ingraspable and inexplicable by means of later\co{distinctions}.  It remains \co{above me}, which in particular means,\co{above} all \co{my} feelings, perceptions, concepts, senses.\ftnt{One tends  to interpret the (even less than one hour old) neonates' responses of  imitation of facial gestures as expressions of a genuine presence of a  separate -- even if only proprioceptive -- self, lived as distinct from the  environment where the gestures to be imitated occur (e.g.,  \citeauthor*{Meltz77,Meltz83,Meltz89}, \citeauthor*{Gall96}). We are not  interested in precise timing of events; \co{birth}, which is the constitution  of \co{self}, may be the moment of conception. But the fact that even  psychological research draws the empirically discernible border of the  emergence of (a residual \nexus\ of) self to the few minutes after birth,  accords with our view much better than the earlier estimates (e.g., of  \citeauthor*{Piaget62}, followed by \citeauthor*{Ponty64}) which denied the  possibility of such an imitation before some late months of the first year.}\pa\label{pa:usedBuber} \co{Reflection} is never identical to its \co{object}.It is identical to, or better, it {\em is} the \co{act} of \co{reflecting}, andin the immediate \co{self-awareness} \co{I} \co{recognise} this identity.  In amore concrete way, \co{I} can direct my \co{reflection} onto \co{myself} -- then\co{I} become immediately aware that what \co{I} am reflecting over is \co{me},the one who is reflecting.  However, this identity remains for\co{self-reflection} noumenal because its true site lies beyond it: it stretchesacross the \co{actualities} which \co{reflection dissociates} in the very momentit is asking about their unity.  The aspects of \co{myself} I can bring forth in\co{self-reflection}, \co{general thoughts} and \co{qualities of my life},appear as accidents of some ultimate \co{self}.  Whether the \co{self} remainsonly an ideal, unexperienced and, as many an empiricist would say, \thi{unreal}construction or, on the contrary, a \co{concrete} and most intimate\co{presence}, depends on \co{myself}, on the way \co{I} decide to guide \co{my  reflection} and which \co{signs} \co{I} decide to accept. The two possibleresponses to the \co{experienced} irreducibility of \co{self}, and even of\co{myself}, to the \co{objective} determinations are: impossible tore-construct hence unreal; or irreducible because more genuine.%\subpa\label{pa:usedBuber}When I \co{reflect} over the \co{self} \co{re-cognising} it as the\co{foundation} of \co{my} \co{unity}, this \co{unity} is no longer relative tomy \co{subjectivity}, it is no longer an \co{objective} identity consummatedwithin the \hoa.  Cartesian \la{Cogito}, just like Kantian unity of apperceptionand all the similar attempts to obtain personal identity from the mere \co{acts}or the structure of \co{actual} consciousness, never managed to arrive atanything except that from which they started: the \co{immediate} self-identityof the \co{self-reflective act}.  In such an \co{act}, \co{I} \co{re-cognise}that it is {\em my} \co{self}, but \co{I} also know that it is more than\co{myself}.  And \co{I} definitely know that it is more than what is\co{actualised} in this mere \co{act} of \co{self-reflection}.  I am the sameand different from myself.  The \co{unity}, not the identity, becomes\co{manifest} as the \co{origin} of \co{myself}, as the deepest source of mybeing -- \co{I} am only its \co{visible} effect and the unity of my \co{act} isonly the final hypostasis of the \co{founding} process originating from theunitary and unique \co{self}.The \co{signs} of personal \co{unity} may be hardly \co{visible}, its\co{experience} may have hardly any \co{actual} reasons, in fact, one may becompletely unable to re-construct this \co{unity} from the bits and pieces of\co{actual} observations. But this need not mean that there is no such thing,only that, if there is, one should not look for it among the \co{objects} of\co{experiences}, let alone at the level of \co{immediate} and decidablydeterminate, that is ideal and idealized, \co{objective precision}.\noo{Hopefully we have at least made plausible the \co{original unity} of our  being which precedes, rather than is constituted by, consciousness.  We are  not doing any science here and it is only \co{existence} and, eventually, its  spiritual dimension, which concerns us. From this perspective it may be better  to keep multiple Is under control because, as a matter of fact, they can get  loose like a \wo{herd of pigs}.  \noo{We are not objecting to any of the    empirical theories of brain, etc. We are only objecting to the ever failed,    empirical attempts to reduce I and, eventually, the unity of a person, to    any observable trivialities and palpable vulgarities. As long as they are    speaking about neurons etc., they are OK...}  }\subsubi{Descriptive vs. normative self}\pa There is a long spiritual tradition according to which all who merely livetheir lives without any spiritual concentration and effort do not attain anygenuine unity but are only collections of separate and independent \thi{Is},drives and desires, bits of consciousness.Visions (true, of God, but in His terrifying rather than benevolent aspect)often involve almost demonic manifold of strange, incoherent creatures whichappear and act in a dreadful autonomy.  \citeti{And every one had four faces,  and every one had four wings.  [\ldots] As for their rings, they were so high  that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them  four.}{Ezek.}{I:6,18} The eye, Jung observes, \citet{is a symbol as well as an  allegory of consciousness.}{JungMC}{II:47} Quite common motif is not only thatof the Eye of God, but also of the multiplicity of eyes, for instance, asfishes' eyes which \citetib{are tiny soul-sparks from which the shining figure  of the filius [divine child] is put together.}{JungMC}{II:46} Also,\citeti{The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the  good.}{Prov.}{XV:3}It would be too optimistic to draw any definitive conclusions from suchexamples, but they may be viewed as witnesses to the old acquaintance with thepossibility, and even actuality, of single aspects of the whole possessing, oracquiring, autonomy in their functioning.  It may be easily recognised in dailyexperience.  At one moment, I think or feel this, at another that, and for themost I do not even remember what I did a moment ago.  I make a promise today,and in two weeks I forget what I promised, the situation has changed so that Iact as if I never promised anything.  I go around {\em thinking} that I am oneand the same person but, on a closer \co{reflection}, there is nothing\co{actual} which could account for, let alone justify, this unity. It appearsdissolved in the multiplicity of transient moods, feelings, thoughts, reactions.\noo{This may go back to sufism or buddhism, but we can also mention a suspect  person of Gierdayev, whose teachings have been popularised by P.~D.~Ouspensky,  e.g., {\em In Search of the Miraculous}, {\em The Psychology of Man's Possible    Evolution}, as one among many emphasizing the actual multiplicity of  \thi{Is} and the need for active effort in order to achieve \co{concrete    unity} of being.}What matters is not that such descriptions can be refined to a theory whichcould even appear plausible. What matters is if it is a complete and satisfyingdescription.  There is no question about sick, or merely disastrous phenomena.As a bushman can \thi{lose his soul}, so \co{I} can lose contact with \co{my  self}, \co{I} can lose \co{myself}, dissolve into a multiplicity of \co{egos},and suffer the associated personal and social problems. (Or, perhaps, it wouldonly be suffering of some of these \co{egos}?)  The multiple \co{egos} canretain the character of selves, and even degenerate into autonomy of variouslower functions.  But even if \co{objectively} the relative autonomy of variouslower functions is a fact, it would not help me (that is, them) the least evento lit a cigarette when I am (they are) feeling like having one (which one? whatone?).  The actual multiplicity of \co{egos} and their relative autonomy is afact which only calls for the stronger active effort in order to maintain\co{concrete unity} of being.  It would be hard to deny relative autonomy ofvarious lower functions, not to mention cellular or even molecular processes inthe body.  But if we forget the little word \wo{relative}, if such an autonomyis a \co{dissociation} of elements unrelated into any unifying whole, it becomeslike~\ldots demons which threaten, as they always did, with the abruptness oftheir uncoordinated movements, as when they \citeti{went into the pigs, and the  whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the  water.}{Mat.}{VIII:32. It is tempting to quote several fragments of  Empedocles: \citefi{Limbs wandered alone./Creatures with rolling gait and    innumerable hands./Many creatures were created with a face and breast on    both sides; offspring of cattle with fronts of men, and again there arose    offspring of men with heads of cattle; and [creatures made of elements]    mixed in part from men, in part from female sex, furnished with hairy    limbs.}{DK 31B58/60/61}{} These might, perhaps, be only images of creatures  arising from the mixture of elements. \wo{But in Wrath they are all different    in form and separate, while in Love they come together and long for one    another.}  [DK 31B21]}\newp\pa\label{pa:strengt} We said that \co{self} is the ontological \co{foundation}of the \co{unity} of the person, and then%in \refp{noselfsense},that it is independent from any sense \co{I myself} might have of it.  Yet, astrong personality will have a strong \thi{sense of self} and it is certainlydesirable to have such a sense. This sense, the \thi{inborn possibility} of the\co{experience} of such a \co{unity}, of continuous and lasting \co{presence},is something we can recognise as the normative aspect of the \co{self}. Thisnormative aspect is but a reflection of the ontological \co{founding}, it is the call \wo{Become yourself!}, the call to \co{concretely} realise the ontologicalanchoring of \co{myself} in \co{self}, to live \co{concretely}, also in\co{visible} terms, the \co{unity} \co{founded} in the \co{self}.  For it is from\co{self}, from \citet{this central nucleus (as far as we know today), [that]  the whole building up of ego consciousness is directed, the ego apparently  being a duplicate or structural counterpart of the original  center.}{MHSFranz}{p.169} \citetib{But this larger, more total aspect of the  psyche appears first as merely an inborn possibility.

There is a long \co{distance} separating the \thi{inborn  possibility} from the \co{actual} challenge, and the \co{actual} challengefrom truly and \co{concretely} becoming \co{one self}.As far as the experience and \co{reflection} focused exclusively on the\co{actual} contents are concerned, the \co{self}, \co{my unity} remains merelyan ideal noumen.  \citetib{The actual process of individuation -- the conscious  coming-to-terms with one's own inner center (psychic nucleus) or Self --  generally begins with a wounding of the personality and the suffering that  accompanies it.

You cannot make yourself understood with others concerning    it, you are alone with it.}{IchDu}{???}  }%The challenge may seem abstract in its \co{vagueness}, but it is the most\co{concrete command} of becoming \co{one self}, of seeking a \co{concrete  foundation} of the \co{unity} of a person, as distinguished from the merelyontological \co{foundation}.  Unlike the latter, the former is not somethingsimply given by nature -- rather, it is a possibility which nature only opensbefore man. Strength is the ability to live the tension between the\co{non-actual} and \co{actual} not as a conflict but as a \co{foundation}, andthis amounts to \co{recognition} of the direction involved in the higher\co{command}, to \co{actualisation} of its \co{vague} imperative as a\co{concrete} value. The \thi{sense of strength} is only a reflection of thesuccess in such a following of the \co{command}, its final \co{visible}consequence. It has a moral, rather than ontological or epistemological flavour,and is a goal rather than a fact. Yet, all \co{objective}, reductionisticattempts are still only {\em trying to account} for the unity.\noo{ (which wouldhardly be called an \wo{illusion} if it were not \co{experienced}).} Certainly,\co{I} am often inconsistent, \co{I} have opposite tendencies and drives, \co{I}often act incoherently, etc. But it is all the time \co{I} who act, \co{I} whohave these tendencies, \co{I} who realise their conflicting force. \co{I} am theone who is called, not {\em a} brain.

The principle of uncertainty does not at all affectmy \co{experience} of {\em this} being \co{precisely} at this point at\co{precisely} this time, and other laws of quantum physics, true and relevantas they may be, are equally indifferent for my way of handling physical objects.\citet{We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been  answered, the problems of life remain completely untouched.}{Tract}{6.52} Anyreductionistic account of person, if it were ever obtained, would have noinfluence on our \co{experience} of personal being, moral responsibility, etc.,except, possibly, of inflicting a temporary confusion in some intellectualcircles.

But when the      relation is lived \co{concretely} the distinction \co{my self}-\co{self}      does not obtain, even if \co{reflection} remains an \co{actual subject} of      such \co{an experience} which does not coincide with anything      \co{external}.  This \co{concreteness}, and it is \co{concreteness} of      being \co{self}, is however unattainable as long as \co{I} insist on being      \co{myself}.  Being selfish has nothing to do with being \co{self}, not      even with being \co{my self}.            \pa \co{Self-reflection} can bring \co{me} closer to the \co{self} only if      \co{I} renounce any questions about its temporal permanence, about      \co{actual} reasons and grounds for its identity.

In this way, \co{I} at      first experience an absolute dependency on this \co{origin}, I can only      accept its gifts or try to ignore them.  This absolute dependence is, as a      matter of fact, a dependence on \co{nothing} -- the \co{invisibles} do not      \co{manifest} any determinate contents, \co{commands} do not tell me      exactly \wo{Do A and not B}.

And if \co{I} accept it, it is still up to me      how \co{I} will live this presence. In short, absolute dependence on      \co{nothing}, on \co{another world} is the same as entire freedom in      \co{this world}, entire freedom of \co{action} and \co{activity}.  This      freedom, this entirety of freedom in \co{this world} is possible only      because \co{this world} is limited by \co{another world}, because the      necessities of \co{actual} determinations are only relative to \co{this        world} and do not even touch the sphere of \co{invisibles}.            \pa The \co{virtual} character of the \co{invisibles} opens thus the field      of freedom of their \co{actualisation}, the filed of \co{my life}. In this      way, and in this sense, they are the source of meaningfulness.  The      meaningfulness consists in participation, it is a property which we      ascribe to \co{visible} things, acts, actions, life, in so far as they      appear as originating in something deeper.%%This \thi{appearing as originating} are concrete feelings which%\co{manifest} the presence of \co{invisibles}.%      The experience of meaningfulness lies in seeing \co{my life}, \co{my        activities} and \co{acts} as flowing out from the \co{origin}, from the      \co{self}, which is greater than \co{me}, which is \co{above me}, which is      \co{my self} but not merely \co{myself}.            \pa This should not be confused with all kinds of ways of attaching      meaning to one's life by replacing the meaningfulness by purposefulness.      Purposes and goals, \co{acts} and \co{actions} are in themselves, that is,      to the extent they are \co{dissociated} from their \co{origin}, devoid of      meaning.  Devoting one's life to useful social work will never make this      life meaningful but just that -- useful.  But devoting one's life to such      a work under the \co{invisible} \co{command} is a different matter -- it      is already from the start involved in the sphere of meaningfulness, even if      it turns out to be useless.  \wo{Works are required for justification,        that is, for holding heaven and earth together, but they are not        meaningful without the gift of grace.  They are required for salvation        but do not guarantee it.}  }}} %end noo\subsubi{My self, self and one}\label{sub:SelfOne}%\pa The \co{transcendence} of \co{invisibles} does not any longer offer groundsfor distinguishing its \co{horizontal} and \co{vertical} dimensions.  It canacquire horizontal character when, for instance, viewed only through the\co{reflective, symbolic signs}.  To the extent \co{symbols} are {empty}, theydo leave a space for progress, they do call for being \thi{completed}.  But true\co{symbols}, the ones which are experienced along with the \co{commands} and\co{inspirations} of the \oss, reveal only pure and simple \co{transcendence} ofessential \co{non-actuality}.  \co{My self} is the field of \co{invisibles} and\co{self} is, so to speak, its peak. \co{One} is beyond even that.  We commentnow on these three stages of ultimate \co{transcendence}, but first observetheir constant \co{presence}.\co{Self}, essentially and ultimately \co{non-actual}, is \co{present} onlythrough \co{my self}.  Being only \co{virtual origin}, it does not \thi{exist}without \co{my self} nor other, lower levels of \co{myself}; to the extent itappears, it does so only through some more or less discernible, though hardlyever \co{precise} contents.  Moreover, as \la{haecceitas}, the \co{trace} of \co{birth}, \co{self} is the constantly \co{present} \co{aspect}of my all being, whether it is itself experienced or not.  This \co{presence}(one would almost like to say, the \wo{\co{immanent presence}}, though thiscould appear a \la{contradictio in adiecto}) does not contradict the\co{non-actual transcendence}, as the \co{reflection} capable only of flatoppositions and contradictions would like it. \co{Immanence} is \co{actuality}and, strictly speaking, one can \co{posit} an insurmountable contradiction. But\co{actuality} is always surrounded by the \co{rest}, the \co{invisible} horizonor, perhaps, the horizon of \co{invisibility} which, \co{non-actual} and\co{non-actualisable}, permeates with its \co{presence} the whole \co{actuality}.This \co{presence} of \co{self} (or the whole world, or \co{my world}, even ofGod) is not \co{actuality}-in-person, exhaustive and full presence of the given.Yet, permeating and affecting the \co{immanence}, it can be ascribed if not the\co{immanence} as such, then at least \co{presence} through and within the\co{immanence}.\ftnt{\citef{The principal causes, then, both proceed into {\em      the things of which} they are causes and at the same time do not depart    from their Principle [...]}{Periphyseon}{II:551D/552A} Just like \co{self}  exists only through \co{my self}, without being the latter, so \citefib{our    reason for saying that the primordial causes are co-eternal with God is that    they always subsist in God without any beginning in time, and our reason for    saying that they are not in all respects co-eternal with God is that they    receive the beginning of their being not from themselves but from their    Creator.}{Periphyseon}{II:561D/562A} The arguments for and against Eriugena's  pantheism and for or against his theism could probably be directed for or  against our exposition.  The fact that he makes it close to impossible to  distinguish between the alternatives seems to us the fundamental strength --  and not any weakness -- of his exposition.}\pa \co{My self} is \co{self} but being is asymmetric and so \co{self} is not\co{my self}. \co{My self} is \co{self} to the degree the latter emerges as\co{mine}.  At first, the contents of experiences of \co{my self} tend to beidentified with \co{self}. But no matter how little or much contents \co{I}manage to discern in such experiences, the \co{self} seems never exhausted bythem. \co{I} can never grasp it.  True, contents can \co{manifest} some truth,they can suggest some kind of direction but even although not \co{mine} in thissense, they are directed to \co{me} and are what makes \co{self} \co{my self}.No \co{self}, however, appears.  \co{Self} can never be content of anyexperience and saying that \co{my self} is \co{my} experience of \co{self}, the\wo{of} must not be taken as indicating the content, not to mention the\co{object} of the experience.  \co{Self} is an \co{invisible aspect} of everyexperience.  In the particular experiences of\co{my self} it is the \co{aspect} which also becomes \co{manifest}, but its\co{manifestation} is then not related to their content. It is \co{present} onlyas their force: irresistible, binding, \co{absolute}. Experiences themselves can be entirely \co{vague} because the \co{objectivity} of their content is close tonil.  It is only the shaking intensity, the tremendous power, the immediatelyrecognisable significance of such experiences -- of revelations, foundingevents, {archetypal dreams} -- which, clothed in the more definite contents of\co{my self}, signal the \co{presence} of the \co{transcendent self} beyond anydiscernible contents.This power and intensity, irrespectively of the content, is what makes suchexperiences the {calls}, the \co{commands}.  They make \co{self} appear as achallenge beyond \co{my self}; the challenge which tradition formulates as\wo{Become yourself}, but which we would have to at least parse differently as\wo{Become your self}, and preferably rephrase as \wo{Become self.}  Theadolescent questions \wo{Who am I?}, \wo{Who am I \co{actually}, really?} are ina sense {expressions} of the call, although the call which does not necessarilycome as a particular experience at any definite time. They expect answers,expect to find something which one could {\em see}, some \co{actual} \thi{what}which distinguishes \co{me} from others -- and thus dissolve in \co{egotic}divagations. Such questions do not help answering the call, although they may bea stage towards it. For what is \co{commanded} is to forget \co{oneself}, tostop \co{dissociating} \co{my self} from \co{self} without, of course, denyingthe distinction between the two; to realise the being \co{I} have always been,but which is not and never will be \co{me}.\noo{As the Aristotelians and  Thomists would say, to \thi{actualise the universal form \thi{man}} (although  the language hardly fits ours).}  \co{Self} is the \thi{inborn possibility} of\co{my self}. But as long as \co{I} insist on \co{mineness} of \co{self}, \co{I}still ascribe irrefutable and uncontested validity to the categories of\co{visibility}, \co{I} still try to adjust the higher to the lower.\pa Now, we have been speaking about \co{commands} and \co{inspirations} in theplural form. But the differences between various \co{commands} concern onlytheir content. This can, to some extent, mean \thi{what} they \co{command}, butprimarily it means only the circumstances under which they occur and the way inwhich they are received and interpreted.  Certainly, \co{distinctionless}\ger{Angst} is a different experience from, equally \co{distinctionless},mystical union; the sudden feeling that \thi{\co{I} am not living \co{my} life}is very different in content from the religious experience of God's \co{presence}.Yet, as \co{commands} they do not command anything particular, and to the extentthey do, it is close to impossible to say what. One rather experiences only\co{that} something has happened, something ultimately significant has visitedthe sphere of \co{actuality}, but {\em what} was it? And although it can be easyto accept \co{that} I should become (my) \co{self}, it is hardly possible to say{\em what} that possibly might mean.All \co{commands}, irrespectively of the differences in content are, eventually,this one \co{command}: \wo{Become self}. Because all the \co{traces} -- of\co{my} experiences, of \co{my life}, of \co{my self} -- lead to and gather inthe center of \co{self} which is their \co{unity}. Following these \co{traces}means to \co{participate} in their \co{origin}.The archetypes (like the primordial causes or intelligibles of the intellect)form a kind of \thi{field}, various points of which can be \thi{activated}, but which remains essentiallyunitary. The archetypes are so intimately interconnected that\thi{activation} of one will almost necessarily lead to\thi{activation} of another. They are distinct, but are hardlydistinguishable, and if so, then only in \co{reflection} or partialexperiences, but not in their operation. One archetype leadsinevitably to another and, eventually, to the most primordial\thi{archetype of all archetypes}, \thi{archetype of wholeness} --\co{self}.\ftnt{A simple, concise account can be found in  \citeauthor*{Synchronicity}{ Lecture III}.}Irrespectively of the differences in the experiences of archetypes, ofprimordial causes, of \co{invisibles} of \co{my self}, what emerges behind themis the ultimate site of \co{invisibility}, the \co{non-actualisable}, ever\co{transcendent self}.  In rare lives the two could almost be pronounced one,there \la{Atman} is \la{Brahman}, the Son is the Father. In such lives the\co{distinctions} of \co{myself} and \co{my self} cease to veil the \co{self}.\paBut unveiling is not \co{actualising}, and \co{self} remains forever \co{above}any distinctions with the exception of the first: \co{separation} from the \co{one}.For \co{one transcends self} just as \co{self transcends my self}. %Let's only consider one more distinction. Does \co{one transcend self} or not?\citet{It is only through the psyche that we can establish that God acts upon us, but we are unable to distinguish whether these actions emanate from God or from the unconscious.

We can neither see nor tell whether\co{self} and Godhead are distinct and if so, what distinguishes the two.  The\co{self}, \thi{the archetype of wholeness} is, in fact, the archetype of allarchetypes, the \co{invisible origin}, so often and naturally \co{symbolised} asa mere point, shall we say, the point in infinity?\noo{It would be hardly  possible to make a complete overview: Jung's examples of a point, Swedenborg,  Plato's One=point, Plotinus' One, Leibniz's `naked monad', Wittgenstein's  `disappearing subject'\ldots} It is the point of \co{origin} which lies\co{above} all possible \co{distinctions}.  The only point present from the verybeginning, the \co{trace} of \co{birth}.  There is no way to say whethersomething comes from \co{self} or from \co{one} because everything, originatingfrom the latter, comes only through the former.But although we can be unable to distinguish whether some actions emanate fromGod or from the unconscious, we are far from identifying the two.Individual psyche, the level of \co{mineness} with all \co{visible}feelings, thoughts and experiences can be conflated with God only by apsychological reductionism. It is only the \co{self}, hidden beyond and\co{above} all \co{visibles} and \co{invisibles}, that comes closer to \co{one};not, however, so close that it can be identified with it.Our scheme will claim the difference between \co{self} and \co{one}; thedifference established by \co{birth} which constitutes \co{self} as theGod-image: the \co{nothingness} of the point which is the whole and onlyreflection of the infinity of the line, of the \co{nothingness} of \co{one}; andthen, differentiation of life and thought which, distinguishing the\co{indistinct}, conducts a constant dialogue with the \co{one}. Everything isbut a reflection of \co{one} and thus \co{one} is always \co{present}(I:\ref{sub:pantheism}), it is \co{present} only through \co{self}, and\co{self} is \co{one} because it is \co{separated} only from \co{one}. But\co{one} is not \co{self}.  The \co{separation}, \co{birth} is exactly whatestablishes the \co{confrontation} of \co{self} with the ultimate\co{transcendence}, and what precludes their coincidence -- precludes, that is,until death, which is the only return of coincidence, \co{indistinctness}.\co{Birth} does not establish a being which then, somehow, becomes\co{confronted} with \co{transcendence}. The \co{separation} of \co{birth} is{\em nothing more} than such a \co{confrontation}.  There is no substance, noessence, nothing more to this fundamental aspect of being \co{self}, than beingalive, that is, being \co{confronted} with the \co{transcendence},\co{distinguishing} the \co{indistinct}.  If the essence of \co{one} is\co{that} it is, the essence of \co{self} is \co{confrontation} with \co{that}.This \co{separation}, and the eternal primacy of \co{one}, is what we canunderstand by \co{one's} ultimate \co{transcendence}, I:\refpf{primacyOne}.\noo{ There is nothing more to \co{existence} than to be \co{born},  \co{confronted} with the \co{one}. And thus we can easily say \co{that} it is  but never \thi{what} it is -- not because there is some hidden \thi{what} but  simply because {\em all} it is is its own \co{that}.\ftnt{This looks like we    have attributed to \co{existence} what the Scholastic tradition attributed    only to God, namely, that \la{quid sit} is \la{se esse}, its essence is its    existence (cf. \refpp{pa:essenceBeing}).  Perhaps, though, it happens simply    because we are not looking for any specific universal \thi{form} of man    which could be, in analogy with the concepts of things and objects,    dissociated from his \co{existence} and \co{posited} as a simple,    all-exhausting definition.  \co{Birth} is the ultimate principle of    individuation and no \thi{matter}, no \thi{accidents} are needed to endow    this \thi{form} with \la{haecceitas}, to make it a \co{concrete} individual.    \noo{This does not make man a \thi{necessary being}, but neither did this      assumed coincidence of \la{quid sit} and \la{se esse} made God into such a      being. For it only means that if we want to {\em think} man (or any living      being; not merely \thi{life in general}), we have to {\em think} him as      \co{existing}. This platitude is not the whole point, but a big part of      it.            But! But! -- this does not distinguish man from other living beings!  No,      it does not. {\em This} does not distinguish man from living beings      because {\em this} is exactly what we understand by \co{existence}. There      are plenty of other, lower level distinctions.  }  About the similarity to    or difference from God we will perhaps say something later on. For the    moment, let us only note perfect similarity of expression, even of    \thi{contradictory} attribution, with respect to man and God, motivated by    the fact that man is God-image: \citef{For the human mind [...] knows that      it is, but does not know what it is.  [...] For just as God is      comprehensible in the sense that it can be deduced from His creation that      He is, and incomprehensible because it cannot be comprehended by any      intellect whether human or angelic nor even by Himself what He is [...] so      to the human mind it is given to know one thing only, that it [human mind]      is -- but as to what it is no sort of notion is permitted      it.}{Periphyseon}{IV:771ABC} }} % end noo\subsubi{Ambiguities of objective-subjective}\label{sub:objsubj}\pa\label{pa:objsubj} \co{Self} as the \co{trace} of a particular \co{birth},and even more \co{my self} as \co{my} {experience} of \co{self}, seems most\thi{subjective}: it can never be grasped in the \co{actual}, \co{objective}categories, it can never be reduced to whatever \co{actual signs} announce aboutit.  But at the same time, being essentially \co{non-actual}, it is most{objective} -- not because it is \co{external} (which it is not) but because itis essentially \co{invisible}, lies beyond the \hoa\ and, hence, beyond thehorizon of any {subjective} control -- \citet{man infinitely transcends  man.}{Pensees}{VII:434\label{cit:manMan}} \co{Self} can be listened to but notcommanded.  It is the place of \co{incarnation}, the most intimate, deepestsource of every \co{manifestation} of \co{invisibles} and the \co{origin} ofevery appearance.  Thus, perhaps, the deep \wo{subjectivity is truth}, notbecause there \co{subject} and \co{object} finally coincide but because there,in the \co{virtual nexus}, lies the origin of this, and every other,\co{distinction}.\pa This ambiguity lies deeply in the usage of the word \wo{objectivity}.  Wetend to think of it as physically \co{external} {things}.  This crudematerialism (followed necessarily by some form of psychologism, as it mustreduce all concepts, even mathematics, to \thi{subjectivity}) is expanded a bitby thinking of objectivity as that which exists independently from me, what is\thi{outside}.  Here comes the crucial ambiguity, for what is independent fromor \thi{outside} me depends on what is understood by the word \wo{me}.  One willtypically understand by it \co{myself}, the horizon of things, feelings,experiences which are classified according to the category of \co{mineness} asopposed to what is \co{not-mine}.  This category comes very close to that ofwill, that is, \co{my will} and, eventually, of control and mastery.  Things are\co{mine} to the extend \co{I} have a sense of mastery over them or, in the mostvulgar sense, to the extend \co{I} possess them.But then what is \thi{outside}, what is \thi{objective} is that which I do notmaster. This characteristic not only turns everything I can control intosomething \thi{subjective} but also threatens the absolute determination of\thi{objectivity} which becomes relative to \co{my} mastery. This, however, need notbe so if there were things which I never could control, which in principle wouldremain outside the horizon of my mastery. And so we keep digging deeper anddeeper, keep looking further and further, and fascinated by the new,\thi{objective} discoveries, soon realise that they are as relative to us aswere the old ones which we left behind. Hunting for a shadow, we find pieces ofrocks and, dissatisfied with our constructions of stone, keep looking, chastingthe wind\ldotsMastery and control do not seem to be the definite features distinguishing{subjective} from {objective}.  Certainly, the glass in front of me, which I canmanipulate as I wish, is there \co{objectively}.  Why?  Because it is\co{external}, it \thi{exists independently from me}, I can leave, disappear,die -- the glass will still be there (unless something destroys it).  But this\thi{independent existence} is but a new variation on the theme of mastery andnon-mastery, in any case, of relativity.  As a privative of \wo{dependence}, itsimply means that I do not have full control over this existence, that it keepssomething away from me.\ftnt{Latin \wo{\la{dependeo}} means to hang on, from or  down, with variations such as to \thi{be derived from} or \thi{be governed    by}.} What this something is, nobody could ever tell\ldots And so we returnto the relative character of \thi{objectivity}, relative to the \thi{subject}from which it must be independent.\pa The ambiguity can be formulated as follows.  The pure \co{subjectivity} isthe pure \co{immediacy}, the coincidence of the \co{sign} and signified, ofaction and reaction. Everything which slips out of this ideally narrow circle bycarrying an element of non-\co{actuality}, acquires a degree of {objectivity},though not necessarily \co{objectivity} as mere \co{externality} confined to the\hoa. The problem is that non-\co{actuality}, where something \thi{objective}and not relative to mere \herenow\ was expected, brings in something into the\co{actually} given, something which seems uncanny subjective. Whatever I bringinto the \co{actual} situation is of a \thi{subjective} character; anotherperson might bring in other preconceptions and distinctions. As Bergson used toobserve, the apparent indeterminacy of one's actions and reactions derives fromone's memory, from this \co{non-actual} element which one's \thi{subjectivity}contributes to the \co{actual} situation.  Thus \thi{objectivity}, having madean unsuccessful leap towards the most universal and \co{non-actual} laws, tendsback towards more and more \co{actually} given. These two extremes -- whether as\thi{form} and \thi{matter}, or as \thi{universal laws} and \thi{actual data},as \thi{theories} and \thi{observations} -- delimit the understanding of\thi{objectivity}.  Unfortunately, both extremes can be equally wellcharacterised as \thi{subjective}: the \co{non-actuality} which is accumulatedonly in the \thi{mind} of a \thi{subject}, and the pure \co{immediacy} which isnot only \thi{theory dependent} but also relative to \herenow, that is, to the presenceof a \thi{subject}.Instead of analyzing the possible and impossible variations of this ambiguity,we only give a few examples which relate directly to the deflation of \co{self}or, what amounts to the same, inflation of \thi{subject}.\ad{Inside vs. outside} Insisting on {\em my} in \co{my self} amounts to aprojection of the \co{visible} categories and introduces an antinomicdialectics of pseudo-opposites, of \thi{within} and \thi{without}, \thi{inside}and \thi{outside}, \thi{subjective} and \thi{objective}.  A prophet speakingfrom \thi{within}, can be accused of projecting extreme \thi{subjectivity} ontothe \thi{objective} world.

And in the experience,on the one hand, it is one's \co{self}, something very intimate \thi{within},which orders one to speak and act in this rather than that way, which is thesource of the experience and its \co{commanding} character.

Put other way, anyappearance of (not to mention dependence on) such categories signals a discourseof a lower level, even if it attempts and pretends to address a higher one.\noo{\tsep{not spirit, not matter}%%%%%% materialism\pa This analogical thinking, which asks questions like \wo{What is  \thi{outside} the mind?}, brings one eventually to apply the spatial analogieswhere they possibly may be applied, and to ask instead \wo{What is \thi{outside}  the body?}. The solipsism of \thi{brain in a vat} is a materialisticcounterpart of the traditional solipsism of idealistic flavour. It is, however,much less convincing than the latter used to be. It terminates the Cartesiansearch for the site of the soul somewhere in the brain and declares, instead,the brain to be all that is experiencing. One can, however, hardly resistdoubting whether life without body and autonomous nervous system would feelexactly as the life feels now. In our language, a brain is just an \co{actual}organ, functionally perhaps more indispensable than many others but in itsmetaphysical status not much different from them. Just like spiritual life cannever be reduced to mere \co{actual representations}, so body can not be reduced to anyof its organs.The \thi{body}-\thi{mind} dualism reflects to some extent the dualism of the\thi{objective}-\thi{subjective}.  But \co{self}, just like \co{one}, is notspiritual as opposed to material.  It is both, or rather, as a mere \co{trace}of \co{separation}, a mere point in the middle of \co{indistinct nothingness},it is neither.  Jung puts it this way: \citet{\label{hmm}The deeper layers of  the psyche lose their individual uniqueness as they retreat further and  approach the autonomous functional systems, they become increasingly  collective until they are universalized and extinguished in the body's  materiality, i.e., in chemical substances.  The body's carbon is simply  carbon.  Hence <<at bottom>> the psyche is simply <<world>>.}{MHSJaffe}{p.310  [quoting Jung]} But, alas!, this looks like a plain materialism. It concludesthat the psyche is \thi{world}, but what it actually says is that \thi{mind} is\thi{body}, the \thi{matter} of organic and chemical processes.Indeed, \thi{mind} exists only in \thi{body}. In fact, \thi{mind} {\em is} the\thi{body}, the \thi{body} which distinguishes. We shouldn't even say that it isa totality of distinctions gathered in the \thi{body} -- it {\em is} the\thi{body}.  As Spinoza might have said, \thi{mind} and \thi{body} are but two\co{aspects} of a \thi{substance}, in fact, only different perspectives fromwhich a living organism can be seen.  The \thi{mind} of an ant is the \thi{body}of an ant making the \co{distinctions} of which it is capable. You can not putthis \thi{mind} into a \thi{body} of an eagle. The \thi{mind} of a person wholost his leg is different from his \thi{mind} before the loss.  The differencemay be negligible and indiscernible, yet in many cases it will give rise toobservable phenomena (as witnessed by all kinds of centers helping victims ofaccidents and catastrophes to cope with psychical and physical damages.)This may look like a bad materialism but it is not.As we discussed in I:\ref{pa:matter}, not only the distinction\thi{body}-\thi{mind} but also \thi{matter}-\thi{spirit} is already a\co{distinction}. It happens far \co{below} the \co{separation} of \co{self}from \co{one}, in fact, fully within the \hoa\ from which it is expanded beyondthe limits of its validity.  \co{Self}, just like \co{one}, is \co{spiritual} inthe more specific sense of being related exclusively to the \co{indistinct  nothingness}. But this is not \co{spirituality} which is in any sense opposedto matter, because it is not opposed to anything whatsoever. It is\co{confronted} with, that is, it exists only in virtue of its involvement into\co{nothingness}, and \wo{spiritual} may be as good (or as bad) a name for thatas \wo{matter}. Outside my body there are, of course, other bodies, just likeoutside my mental horizon there are thoughts and ideas of others which I am notcapable to embrace or understand. \co{I} am able to draw the \co{distinctions}between these variants of \thi{insides} and \thi{outsides}. But \thi{outside}\co{self} there is only \co{nothingness}, and none of them is more nor less\thi{objective} or \thi{subjective} than the other.}\ad{Objective values vs. subjective preferences}\label{pa:allsubjective}The ambiguity between \co{objectivity} of \co{external objects} and more vague,but also more common, {objectivity} of independence, illustrated by thefollowing example, is quite a common ground of confusion and misunderstandings.Max Scheler claimed the existence of an {objective} hierarchy of values which,of course, appeared most repulsive to all forms of empiricism identifying valueswith \co{subjective} inclinations and mere \co{acts} of preferences.  \wo{Of  course that things do not have any value in-themselves, there are no values  independent from our (or other) being for which objective things may or may  not have some value.} The conflict, if there is any, rests exclusively on theunderstanding of the words \wo{objective}, \wo{subjective}, eventually, of\wo{I}.For the empirically minded opponents of the {objective values} the\thi{subjective I} is an atom, an unstructured (even if, possibly, complicated)entity which determines the pole of subjectivity.  Everything which is in one oranother (but always unclearly specified) way ascribed to this \co{ego} assomehow originating in it, is subjective.  Sensations, perceptions, impressionsand feelings are as subjective as thoughts, ideas, intuitions, revelations --they are all \co{mine}.  Going only a bit further, the \thi{objective} issomething which not only is completely independent from and not relative to\co{me}, but which is so also in relation to all humans, perhaps even to allother beings.  Strangely enough, as the examples of \thi{objective} beings, onemanages to mention only pieces of chalk, chairs, tables.  The rejection of{objectivity} of values rests on the conflation of one's whole, structured beingwith an ideal noumenal unity of a \co{complex ego}, and claiming that everythingrelative in whatsoever way to this being is equally \thi{subjective}.Equivalently (for this is only another expression of the same conflation), therejection rests on pointing at tables and chairs, and making the trivialobservation that values are not things of the same kind.Values are not \co{objects} and yet they are found residing objectively\co{above} every particular \co{existence}.%The following analogy may help clarifying the issue.  We consider thoughts to beour possessions, \co{my} thoughts to be {\em mine}, in the sense that others donot have access to them unless \co{I}, their originator and possessor, revealthem. Their subjectivity consists also in that once formulated and conscious,they can be to some extend manipulated and controlled by \co{me}. However, it isonly control of a limited degree because thoughts (unlike phantasies) havecontent and presentation which is not completely underlied \co{my will}.Moreover, except for some very special cases, \co{I} do not generate \co{my}thoughts.  \co{I} encounter them, often when \co{I} think about completely otherthings, often when \co{I} do not think at all (changing the focus of attentionafter a prolonged concentration on a problem provokes often spontaneousemergence of most creative solutions). One will delegate the responsibility forthe appearance of thoughts to the \thi{brain}, which is supposed to work beyondthe threshold of one's consciousness. But such a delegation of responsibilitycan at best serve as a partial (pseudo-)explanation in terms of the currentlyaccepted imagery -- it does not in any way contribute to renderingcomprehensible the meaning of such a \thi{foreign element} in the midst of one'smost intimate privacy. Even if \co{I} possess \co{my} thoughts, \co{I} am nottheir originator or, even if I am, it is not \co{myself} in the same sense ofthe {subjective}, \co{actually} conscious \co{ego}.  \citet{Subjectivism is  mistakenly connected with \la{apriorism} only when \la{apriori} is taken not  only as (exclusively) primary <<law>> of acts, but also as the law of acts of  an <<I>> or a <<subject>>.}{MaxForm}{II:A.\kilde{p.94}\orig{Subjektivismus ist    mit dem Apriorismus aber auch dann irrig verkettet, wenn das Apriori nich    nur als (ausschlie{\ss}lishes) prim\"{a}res \thi{Gesetz} von Akten, sondern    au{\ss}erdem noch als das Gesetz von Akten eines \thi{Ich} oder eines    \thi{Subjektes} gedeutet wird.} The point is much subtler than we are making  it here. Scheler objects to any kind of <<subject>>, whether empirical or  transcendental, as some posited content while, as he maintains, \la{a priori}  can concern only acts as such: their structure, intentions, values they  express. But our only concern is the fact that the \co{actual} intentions and  \co{acts} carry \co{aspects} which are neither determined nor controlled by  \co{ego}.  Whether these are \la{a priori} or not (and where one at all wishes  to draw the line of this opposition) is another issue. }%The {objectivity} of the hierarchy of values can be understood plausibly alongthe same lines as the fact that \co{I} do not create values, \co{I} do notdetermine that \thi{good} is better than \thi{bad}, that \thi{holy} is higherthan \thi{pleasant} -- \co{I} encounter this as an {objective} fact.\ftnt{If  somebody does not, and claims that, for instance, \thi{pleasant} is a higher  value than \thi{holy} then he can be easily accused of some blindness to  values or illusion in their perception.  But even if we do not do that, and if  his statements are not based on merely arbitrary choices, then he, too,  encounters \thi{pleasant} as higher than \thi{holy}, he {\em finds them being    so} and does not merely decide them to be so.}  The objectivity of valuesreflects the stratification of \co{existence} in which the \co{active subject}encounters not only \co{external} things but also ones which, affecting hismotives, goals and \co{acts}, do not originate in his activity and are notreducible to its results.\ad{Self vs. ego}\label{pa:SelfEgo} The ambiguity just sketched becomes veryprominent in the\noo{quarrels about the meaning and} refutations of the ultimatetruth of the dictum \wo{Man is the measure of all things.}  Most trivially onewould interpret it as stating that \co{subjective} goals, wishes and whims,feelings and perceptions measure the true being of all things and refute it as asophism -- at best immediately, and at worst, using half of a lengthydialogue.\noo{the same wind is blowing, and yet one of us may be cold and the  other not, or one may be slightly and the other very cold [...]  not every man  is the measure of all things -- a wise man only is the measure: Theaethetus} Abit more psychologically, one might observe that indeed one's moods and generalsituation will influence the way things are experienced and handled. One wouldstill try to maintain some opposition to the hard and \co{precisely objective}truths about things, though this becomes a bit more problematic.  Finally, onecan take \wo{man} to mean not the \co{actual} or psychological subject but the\co{self} of \co{existential confrontation}. \wo{Measure} loses then most of itsnormative and moral character and becomes a mere reflection of the relativity ofbeings to \co{existential distinctions}.  Historically, most forms of (the attempts at or claims to) \co{actually}controlling the higher, spiritual dimension -- whether ancient forms of magic,theurgy, this \citet{power higher than all human wisdom, embracing the blessings  of divination, the purifying powers of initiation, and in a word all the  operations of divine possession,}{ProclusTP}{\citaft{GreekIr}{ p.291}}ambitions of Pico and then pretensions of a Renaissance magus personifiedeventually as doctor Faustus, esoteric practices of the Mdm. Blavatsky circle,Rudolf Steiner's guidelines for systematic development of genuine spiritualityor, finally, the so called \wo{New Age religiosity} (which is not newerphenomenon than modernity and romanticism) -- all such forms result from theconflation of \co{self}, which truly is the source, with the \co{actual ego} forwhich this deeply \co{spiritual} truth turns into a trivially flat falsehood.It leads to the flattening of \co{existence}, to considering it only along the\co{horizontal} dimension of \co{visibility}, for everything else and, inparticular, \citet{the nature [<<Wesen>>] which man opposes to himself in  religion and theology as something different from himself, is really only his  own nature.}{Feuerbach}{III\kilde{p.31}}\noo{such statements can be endowed  with deeper meaning if only one understands \wo{being} [<<Wesen>>] in a more  genuine sense, they actually intend exactly the reduction to which we are  objecting.} Such anthropomorphism, suggesting that the \co{spiritual selfhood}is really nothing else than the \co{actual subject} with its volitions, choicesand preferences, can hardly avoid the spiritualistic pretensions to the\co{actual} control of all significant dimensions of human existence. The Hindu thinkers avoided the confusion of the \la{atman} with the empirical self,the \la{jivatman}, just like German idealists avoided the confusion of thetranscendental with the empirical ego.  Kierkegaard accused of this confusion theRomanticist followers of Fichte: \citet{This Fichtean principle, that  subjectivity, that Self has constitutive validity and is the only omnipotent,  has been taken up by Schlegel and Tieck, and applied to the world. This caused  double difficulty. For the first, one confused the empirical and finite Self  with the eternal Self; for the second, one confused the metaphysical reality  with the historical one.}{Irony}{II:4.Irony after Fichte} The same confusionaffected then Kierkegaard's religious individual confronting God; the individualwho, in the hands of French existentialists, became a lonely {ego} laden withthe impossibility to constitute any genuine meanings from \thi{within} its{alienated subjectivity}.\ftnt{The accusation of this confusion must not be  confused with the claim of the ontological independence of the two egos. Such a  claim might, occasionally, seem present, for instance, in the opposition  postulated by Husserl between the pure and empirical ego. Ingarden clarifies:  \citef{The subject of the stream of consciousness is not a separate entity in    relation to the soul [empirical ego] which unfolds in the experiences of    this stream, but is inherent in it as the axis of its construction\lin Stream of    experience, subject, soul, respectively human person, are only certain    <<aspects>> of one, internally compact, conscious being: a    monad.}{Swiat}{vol.II:XVII.V.79\lin 83} One would be tempted to recall again  formal distinction of Duns Scotus, according to which, these two (as well as  other) levels of \co{existence} are both real and yet not really separable.}The prevalence of this confusion suggests the simple reflection: removing the\co{absolute} which constitutes the ultimate dimension of \co{existence}, one isremoving also the ground for this very distinction, for now \co{existence} canonly be understood as \co{ego}, as unfolding on one level only, in the sphere of\co{visibility}.  \noo{Heidegger: confusion of ontological and ontic dimension.}\ad{Civilisation vs. nature}\label{civObjSubj} A similar ambiguity concerningthe meaning of subjectivity can bediscerned in the understanding of civilisation as opposed to nature. One saysthat civilisation, history, society are creations of mankind and, imperceptibly,tends to find in it a reason to pride.  Since they are created by \thi{us}, theycarry this character of \thi{subjectivity}, of being relative to \thi{us}, being\thi{our} products, \thi{our} achievements. Nature, on the other hand, remains\thi{out there}, retaining the character of \thi{given objectivity}. Suchoppositions may perhaps have some relevance in sociological, historical orecological studies. But from the point of view of individual \co{existence},this collective \thi{subject} is but a \co{posited} ideality, like a noumenal selfendowed with features and functions of the \co{ego}. In fact, ithas nothing to do with any \co{subject}, not to mention \co{self}.  In \co{my  experience} the role of history, civilisation, and \thi{us} who created them,is very close, if not entirely analogous, to that played by nature -- theyare encountered, they are \thi{objective}, \thi{outside} \co{myself}.\co{Positing} such a collective \thi{subject} leads quickly to the \citet{idolatry of history [which] is born of this unavowed nostalgia for a  future which would justify the unjustifiable.}{Opium}{II:The control of  history;p.192} The fact that historical creations are \thi{ours} does notnecessarily make them more human than nature. Inhumanity of some such creationsis no better, and often worse, than inhumanity of the most disastrous naturalcalamities.\noo{It seems that the capacity for evil might be as good  \gre{differentia specifica} of humans as rationality -- unlike humans, animals  and natural \citef{catastrophes are innocent.}{HerbertAnts}{ Cleomedes}. In  BOOK III}This is not the place for yet another critique of historicism. We only want toobserve that the attitudes, reactions and activities required or only madepossible by society can be very similar to those posed by nature. It helps verylittle that a political system was created by \thi{us} if to change it requiressacrifice, courage, dedication and analyses surpassing those required inconfrontation with the non-human world. The human world, the world createdby \thi{us}, is not underlied our control any more than nature is.  \citet{Man is  no longer able to control the world, which emerged thanks to him; this world  overwhelms man, liberates itself from him, appears to him as independent and  man no longer possess the word-spell with which he could {placate} Golem which  he created.}{ProbMen}{II:1.1} That it is \thi{we} who create history andsociety is as true as it is illusory.  \citet{Whether primitive or not, mankind  always stands on the brink of actions it performs itself but does not control.  The whole world wants peace and the whole world prepares for war, to take but  one example. Mankind is powerless against mankind, and the gods, as ever, show  it the ways of fate. Today we call the gods \wo{factors}, which comes from  \la{facere}, \thi{to make}. The makers stand behind the wings of the  world-theatre.}{JungArche}{I:49} We \thi{create} our society and history justlike ants create the ant-heap and its history. Sure, without ants, no ant-heaps.But we conflate the necessary conditions with the sufficient ones only becausecraving a final explanation and control, we are willing to settle for a merepretense of either. For an individual ant the heap is as much nature as it is asociety, it is encountered with the same character of givenness as the naturearound, even if this ant contributed far over the average to building the heap(that is, to strengthening of the society or to preservation of nature?)  Thecollective \thi{subjects} are of entirely different nature than the individualones, to the degree that talking about subjects seems misleading.\noo{ even if  one can produce long lists of vague analogies.  If nothing else, then at least  the time scale brings these two kinds of \thi{subjects} completely out of  proportion with each other.  The continuity of will in a collective  \thi{subject} is, like everything else, determined by the continuity of will  of the involved individuals. A project started today may never reach its  completion because in a few years the individuals responsible for it may  change or, perhaps, remain the same but only change their minds. The  \thi{control} \thi{we} have over our society and history is so feeble that it  may be justly attributed to nothing else than good luck.  And where is good  luck there is bad luck also.}%The illusion\noo{ so intensely analysed by Foucault,} that \thi{we} createhistory and society in a way which is somewhat analogous to the way anindividual unfolds his life, comes from confusing an ideal \thi{us} with anindividual \thi{subject}. (The classical example being Feuerbach and then Marx,not to mention more abominable examples, following Hegel in conflating man's essence with the universal human naturecommon to all individuals, which is then posited as the society, the onlysubject of history with its \thi{collective will} and \thi{collective reason}.)The illusion that \thi{we} not only create but also \co{actually} control our history and society comes then from considering such a\thi{subject} as not living on the border between \co{visible} and\co{invisible} but as being in full control of itself. (At least, in so far asit manages to escape the power of blind forces of the market and, carefullycalculating and planning its production and history, reaches to the communisticfreedom.)\noo{ For an individual, there are as many possibilities to influence,  from his \thi{subjective} intentions, the social organisation as there are  \thi{objective} aspects of this organisation far beyond his control. We wanted  only to observe another example of the ambiguity: }\noo{ The illusion arises  from the ambiguities of the {objective} and \co{objective}, of the higher and  the \co{external}, eventually, of the subjective and the objective resulting  from the inflation of \co{ego}, which such a generously \thi{humanistic}  attitude endows with power of moulding its own (that is, \thi{our} own) world.} The futurological phantasies and socio-historical optimism are but anotherface of humanism turned positivism, of an inflation of \co{ego} which has beenendowed with the power of voluntarily moulding its own (that is, \thi{our} own)world.% We leave analysing any further distinctions of this kind to sociologists,% economists and political scientists.\noo{\pa Analyses of unconscious contents are certainly often needed in  psychotherapy and may be of invaluable importance.  But the distinction  between \co{my self} and \co{self} will, in the next chapter, lead us beyond  the sphere of such analyses, for the healthy balance between \co{visible}  contents and \co{acts} of consciousness and their \co{invisible origin} is  eventually based on the \co{spirituality} of \co{self} to which all  \co{distinctions}, whether \co{visible} or not, are subordinated.    \pa{Shall we also add here, or somewhere around here -- the entering into    \co{actuality} through {\em both} circle and plane (expectations, vague    anticipations, etc.)  with exceptions (``Det Demoniske er det plutselige'';    unexpected brick falling from the roof, a feeling aroused by other feelings    rather than in relation to the situation (though this is a bit of    anticipations)); and then, all modern theories of `perception' conditioned    by `expectations', etc.  which are but variations on Plato's reminiscence    theory, with \gre{a-letheia} as a privative form }}  \section{Above and below}%Relations lower-higher (in abstracto)}In Book I we saw the relation of \co{ontological founding} of lower levels bythe higher ones, the stages of hypostases, the gradual \co{actualisation} of the\co{original} \co{virtuality}.  This Book has, so far, described the\co{reflection} over and of these levels in the \co{reflective experience} whichbegins and proceeds upwards with the categories of \co{reflective dissociation},but which is grounded in the ontological hierarchy.  Our being is structuredinto different levels according to the temporal scope and forms of\co{transcendence}, and this structure reflects the ontological hierarchy ofregions of Being, the generative order of hypostases.  The hierarchy isexperienced through different kinds of \co{signs} and their juxtapositions in inany \co{concrete experience}, as well as by the \co{rest} which surrounds every\co{actuality} with the \co{traces} of its origin.% The \co{distinction} of different levels may seem to be a bit% arbitrary and, as always, I admit that there is no necessity of% viewing things this way.  But that they are not necessary is no big% problem because, in fact, no \co{distinctions} are necessary. % (\co{Any experience} involves all the levels and from the next section% on, we will begin addressing this unity.)The \co{distinctions} between the levels, grounded in \co{experience} as theymight be, are \co{distinctions} of \co{reflection}, that is, are prone to givingrise to \co{reflective dissociation}.  \co{Reflection} tends to \co{re-cognise}the \co{distinctions}, if not the hierarchy, of levels and it often builds itsmodels around particular level.  Various \co{complexes}, \co{concepts} and ideasacquire vastly different character when viewed by \co{reflection} from a limitedperspective of a single level.\noo{The claim would be that most philosophical  ideas, or rather most ways of modeling in philosophical thought, could be  understood as originating in a perspective relative to a particular level.}%%%%%%However, \co{any experience} involves all the levels of Being -- the \co{one} asits ultimate, \co{transcendent} and \co{invisible} yet always \co{present} source, theunity of \co{life} and \co{the world} as the horizon of the \co{visible  distinctions}, the \co{complexes} of \co{actual} situations and involved \co{recognitions} and,possibly, the \co{immediate} \co{objects}.  In phenomenological terms, every\co{immediate} perception is involved in the texture of \co{actual} \co{mood} or\co{impression}, surrounded by the feeling of \co{my life} and, ultimately (thatis also, trans-phenomenally), by the \co{invisible} \co{inspiration}.This section summarises schematically the distinctions between various levelsand the ways in which they are related to each other.  This should clarify notonly the differences offering \co{reflection} the possibility of considering\co{experience} from different perspectives, but also the unity of \co{an  experience} which always involves all the levels. Thus, this section addressesin a preliminary fashion the proper \co{unity} of \co{existence} which will betreated in Book III.\subsection{The hierarchy of levels}\noo{Each level has the associated kind of \co{distinctions}, their degree of  \co{precision} and scope of limits, which characterise the ontology specific  to this level level. The word \wo{being} or \wo{existence} will acquire some  of this specificity.  Indeed, the levels of \thi{to be}, starting with the  \co{existential confrontation}, proceed through the personal \co{I} living in  the world towards more and more \co{objective} and eventually \co{external    objects}, mere beings-at-hand. This apparent equivocity of \wo{being} is,  however, only a symptom, is only a \co{sign} of various ways and levels of  being, of various ways in which \co{One} is in \co{confrontation} with  \co{existence}. }\paFirst of all, the notion of time itself% , which in high degree conditions the differentiation into levels,acquires quite different determinations depending on the level of\co{reflection}.In terms of \co{actuality}, it is the primary factor distinguishing the levels.The further down we move in the hierarchy, the more we approachideal \co{immediacy}.  In terms of objective time, it means simplyshorter time.  But objective time offers only an analogy of limited value.  Itwould require to say that the level of \co{invisibles} corresponds to infinityof time, which is a rather poor picture. The further down we move, the more weapproach the actual experience of \co{objective} time, while the further up, thecloser we are to the \co{origin} of time.  The level of \co{invisibles} lies\co{above} time in the sense that its \co{distinctions} are not prone to{objectification} and hence are not involved into the temporality which isbut an \co{aspect} of \co{objectivity}.  It is the level involving only essentially\co{non-actual} \co{distinctions}, that is, \co{distinctions} whose value andstructure, if not the content, is not affected by the temporality of\co{experience}. As lying \co{above} time, they may be termed eternal, while the lower levels, with theirinherent temporality are only \citet{moving image of eternity.}{Timaeus}{VII}. Trying to understand the world in terms of pure \co{immediacy} alone, positingthe pure \herenow\ as the only reality, would imply that there is no time butonly a point-like pure \thi{now}.\noo{Since it is hard to deny that we do  have an experience of time and duration, one may be then led to claim (as some  theories do) that the world is re-created at each (time-)point anew.  Who and  why would bother to invest so much work into making us feel that things last,  is entirely unclear to me, as are possible (if any) advantages of such a view.  The fact that such a theory might be developed without contradictions should  illustrate what the criterion of \thi{being contradiction-free} is worth.}Perceiving the world in \co{objective} terms of \co{complexes} and theirrelations yields the objective time, succession of ideally \co{dissociated} time-points.Perceiving it in terms of \co{mineness} or, more generally, in terms of a unity of a living being,yields the \thi{time of life} and, in fact, the \thi{lived time}. Bergson's\fre{dur\'{e}e} is an excellent and most thoroughly worked out example of thisperspective. Less inspiring examples are provided by some phenomenologicallygrounded existentialistic theories of time as unity of past, now and futurecentered around the ecstatic actuality of lived experience.Finally, \co{reflection} focused exclusively on the level of \co{invisibles} leads todenying the reality of time. Unlike in the first case, however, it does not positthe exclusive reality of pure \co{immediacy} but, instead, some form ofsupra-temporal eternity, of which \herenow\ is but a manifestation. %Variants of this will often be present in mystical thought.We can summarise this \co{trace} of temporality schematically as follows:\levsTab %{9.5}{The modifications of the temporal aspect}{& \co{experienced} & {objectified time}}{\thi{shortest experienced time} & {ideal now}}{time of things & {finite and limited}}{time of \co{my life} & {finite and unlimited} }{\co{above} time & {infinite} }%{experienced} {abstract}\paModifications of temporality are reflected in the character of the \thi{objective} contents of the \co{experiences} of the respective level.\levsTab %{9.5}{The modifications of the \thi{objective} aspect} {& in \co{experience} & \la{in abstracto}/objectified}{the \co{sign} itself & \co{object}}{situation & \co{complex}}{\co{the world} & universe}{\co{origin} & the \co{one}}%This \thi{objective} \co{trace} is thought in dissociation from the temporaldimension.  It has a spatial character of simultaneity or \co{actual}co-presence. Even when we think \thi{the world} with its history anddevelopment, we still tend to \co{posit} it as an \co{actual} totality.%\noo{ still thinks \thi{the world} as a permanent entity which lasts through all  the changes it has undergone.

Yet, space, in its \thi{frozen} simultaneity,functions as the limit of temporality, as permanence.  But even though we tendto refer the \co{vague} intuition of eternity to the permanence as some ideallimit of atemporal \thi{objectivity}, it is only in the \co{actual} passage oftime that we \co{concretely experience} permanence.  The sense of permanence isonly another side of the sense of change and passage of time and it is naturallyacquired and recognised in the \co{experience} of getting old. \la{Mundus  senescit}, \wo{The world has aged}, is not \co{any experience} of childhood.%\subpa\label{pa:oldpeople}That the world, \co{this world} ages -- and aging, withers -- is only areflection of the fact that so does its \co{experience}.  This frequent, andoften only apparent, withering of the intensity of the \co{experience}, whichone tends to ascribe to old people, is but a modification of the level fromwhich old people \co{experience} their life.  Old age simply experiences time(and the world) differently than the young one.  The approaching death, theknowledge that most things one was to experience have already happened, make onethink of one's life as a whole, if not quite completed, than in any case as notconsisting merely of petty \co{actualities}.  The significant time span is nolonger a mere moment, a brief actuality but years, perhaps, decades.  Thedetails wither but they give place to a new quality of \co{experience}, whichwith time becomes itself \co{an experience} and which younger people will simplyfind irrelevant, if they find it at all.\ftnt{We are not concerned with the  tasteless caricatures trying to the last moment pretend that they are  experiencing the world with youthful intensity. \co{Attachment} and despair  will be addressed in Book III.}%Through the memories of all \co{experiences} Above all, all the changes of the surrounding world notwithstanding, one seesthat nothing has really changed, that something fundamental, even ifingraspable, remained the same since the earliest days of one's childhood.  Onemay recognise the same curiosity or indifference, the same feelings of wonder ordisenchantment, the same \co{vague} motivations and fascinations.  Thedifference is only that one has already seen all that before, that one knowsthat some things need time and thus single moments, enchanting and gratifying asthey may be, are no longer of the highest importance.  Shall we also mention thequite so frequent turn towards various forms of religiosity?  It is not,however, as one often wants to interpret it, a mere fear of facing the death, orelse a mere disillusionment and dissatisfaction with one's life (possible asthese are).  On the contrary, it is rather the sign of reaching the level of\co{experience} at which one realises the limits of one's life and world,perhaps, their insufficiency, if not vanity.%It is great gift if one%gets this feeling earlier \ldotsThe \thi{objectified} permanence gives place to the sense of \co{eternity}, notany infinity of time, but a lived \co{eternity}, the constant \co{presence} of\co{invisibles}, perhaps even of the ultimate \co{nothingness}, which has beenstrangely known all one's life.  It is neither necessary to get old to meet such\co{experiences}, nor does getting old necessarily imply that one will meetthem.  But you have seen such a transition in old people more than once and moreoften than in the young ones. %%% signs... bottom-up consciousness \pa\label{pa:levsSigns}The tension between the {objective} and {subjective} aspect enters the \hoa\ through various \co{signs}. Their character varies depending onthe level which they address, to which they point, from which their contentsarise. \levsTab%{9.5}{The signs:}{& \oss & \rss}{sensations, instantaneous images     & \co{that it is}: substances, \co{objects} }{\co{moods}, \co{impressions}, vital feelings      & \co{that it is so-and-so}: \co{concepts} }{\co{qualities of life}, \thi{soulful} feelings      & \co{that I am}: \co{general thoughts} }{\co{commands}, \co{inspirations}      & \co{that I am not the master}: \co{symbols} }%{\oss}{\rss}%   At the lowest level the \co{signs} coincide with the \co{immediate object} andgive rise to a merely reactive response relative to a particular organ, a point ofthe body, a nervous nexus.\noo{This suits naturally and well all empiricistreductionists, and we can leave it for them to limit their thinking exclusivelyto this level.} The higher we move in the hierarchy, not only the responsebecomes less reactive but also the more \co{clear} becomes the \co{distance}separating the \co{sign} from the signified or, the \co{actual}from the non-\co{actual} and, eventually, from the \co{non-actual}.\co{Experience} of this \co{distance} is but a reflection of the form of\co{transcendence} which is an aspect equally constitutive for each level astemporality.     \pa \co{Transcendence} is the \co{presence} of \co{non-actuality}.% and each level is characterised by a specific tension between the \co{actual}% and \co{non-actual}, that is, by the specific form of transcendence. AtAt each level below the \co{invisibles} it has two \co{aspects}: the\co{vertical}, relating directly to the higher level, and \co{horizontal} whichis a reflection of the \co{vertical aspect} in terms and categories of thegiven level.  For instance, the \co{more} at the level of \co{actuality} is buta quantitative \thi{more} of \co{complexes} of which \co{reflection}\thi{knows}, even if only implicitly or potentially.  But this \co{more} is onlya reflection of the horizon of \co{the world} and \co{my life}, which are as if projectedinto the context which tries to understand everything as \co{complexes}.  The\co{more}, rendered as the flux of \co{experience}, throws \co{reflection} backonto itself and establishes meaning of \co{complexes} in relation to one's  life.  Similarly, the \co{horizontal aspect} at the level of \co{mineness}comprises that which is \co{not-mine}. This, however, is still a determinationin terms of \co{mineness} and it merely reflects the \co{vertical  transcendence}, the \co{presence} of \co{invisibles}.\ftnt{The \co{vertical    aspects} of \co{transcendence} could be described as what Paul Tillich  called \wo{forms of meaning}. If one includes in this term \citef{\imm all    particularities of individual meanings and \act of all separate connections    of meaning and even \mine the universal connection of meaning, then in    relation to the universal connection of meaning \inv the unconditioned    meaning may be designated as the import of meaning.}{TilRel}{I:1.1.a [my    numbering]} And the \citefib{import of meaning is the ground of reality    presupposed in all forms of meaning, upon whose constant presence the    ultimate meaningfulness, the significance, and the essentiality of every act    of meaning rest.}{TilRel}{I:Introduction.c.ii}.}%\subpaSchematically:% \hspace*{1em}% \levels{The horizontal and vertical aspect of transcendence}\hspace*{1em}\xymatrix@R=0.5cm@C=1.5cm{\inv\ \mbox{\co{invisible}}:\ \ \ \  & \mbox{\co{origin}}  && \mbox{\co{the\ One}}\\%\ \ \mine\ \mbox{\co{mineness}}:\ \ \ \ \   & \mbox{\co{my\ life}}  \ar[rr] &&\mbox{\co{not-mine}} \ar[ull]^<<<<<<<<<<<<<{\co{chaos}}|{\co{I\ am\ not\ the\    master}} \\\act\ \mbox{\co{actuality}}:\ \ & \mbox{\co{complex}}  \ar[rr] &&      \mbox{\co{more}} \ar[ull]|{\co{experience},\ meaning,\ relevance}\\%\imm\ \mbox{\co{immediacy}}: & \mbox{\co{object}} \ar[rr] &&     \mbox{\co{externality}} \ar[ull]^<<<<<<<<<<<{\co{an\ experience}\ \ \ \ }|{ \ context,\ purpose}} \vspace*{1ex}\noindentThe \co{horizontal aspect} has always a negative character: it is that which isnot~\ldots \herenow, \co{actual}, \co{mine}.  Using it as the criterion of progressmight easily lead into a Hegelian kind of dialectics.  But this negative,\co{horizontal aspect} reflects only the \co{vertical aspect} which is known and\co{experienced} not as a mere lack, limit and negation but positively. Itpenetrates the quality of the \co{experiences} at the given level, placing themon the \co{traces} which reach to the deeper, that is higher, sources.  It isthis higher level, the level less dominated by the \co{actuality}, which is thesource of the mode of \co{transcendence experienced} at the lower level.  The\co{horizontal aspect} reflects the \co{vertical aspect} in the multiplicitydifferentiated according to the categories of the lower level. It refers thusalways to the higher, \co{founding} element -- but only indirectly. Its negative-- or quantitative -- character signifies, in terms of \co{reflective}development, encountering a limit -- a limit beyond which the categories appliedso far seem to lose their meaning, beyond which there is nothing left except,perhaps, a routine repetition stiffening the soul; a limit showing worthlessnessof the things and categories which so far have been experienced as the ultimate.Encounter with the \co{vertical} aspect, on the other hand, is \co{an  experience} of something fundamentally new, something which, at first, appearsonly as a \co{vague} promise, but which with time discloses a deeper meaning, anew way of seeing also earlier \co{experiences}.  This encounter is a true\gre{anamnesis}, a \co{re-cognition} of something which has been known for along time, but only dimly and indistinctly, as a \co{vague} intuition, anindefinable \co{rest}.\noo{ \co{Horizontal} aspect of \co{transcendence} is a reflection of its  \co{vertical aspect} in the multiplicity differentiated according to the  categories of the lower level. It refers thus always to the \co{founding}  element as, for instance, in Levinas': \wo{objectivity presupposing the    other}, \wo{discourse presupposing the other}, point to the other, the  transcendence \la{par excellence} for Levinas, as the element \co{founding} the  more specific, lower level relations. Similar schema underlies the claim that  \wo{social relations presupposing \co{justice}}, [p.76], etc.    \ccom{ -- this isn't Plotinus' quote -- The two aspects of \co{transcendence}    can be illustrated by the following remark from Plotinus: \citt{The soul      [\ldots] can be turned about and led back to the world above and the      supreme existent [\ldots] by a twofold discipline: by showing it the low      value of the things it esteems at present, and by informing -- reminding      [\gre{anamnesis}] -- it of its nature and worth.}{Plotinus [not really],      p.103 -- The Psyche in Antiquity}        \citet{And Intellection in us is twofold: since the Soul is intellective,      and Intellection is the highest phase of life, we have Intellection both      by the characteristic Act of our Soul and by the Act of the      Intellectual-Principle upon us -- for this Intellectual-Principle is part      of us no less than the Soul, and towards it we are ever      rising.}{Plotinus}{I:1.13} }} % end \noo{\noo{ against Heidegger: \citet{Still there is a twofold flaw: the first lies in    the motive of the Soul's descent [its audacity, its Tolma], and the second    in the evil it does when actually here: the first is punished by what the    soul has suffered by its descent: for the faults committed here, the lesser    penalty is to enter into body after body- and soon to return- by judgment    according to desert, the word judgment indicating a divine ordinance; but    any outrageous form of ill-doing incurs a proportionately greater punishment    administered under the surveillance of chastising    daimons.}{Plotinus}{IV:8.5} }\pa\label{pa:SchelerA} As we move higher in the hierarchy of levels, we leave\co{actual} determinations.  We lose \co{objective} categories, the\co{distinctions} become less rigid and \co{precise} and do not present us withany definite \co{objects} -- they become \co{vague}.  But by the same token,they become more intimate, they penetrate deeper into our being.  The intensityof \co{signs} increases and so does the depth of satisfaction found in\co{experiences} -- they become \co{clearer}.\ftnt{Big parts of this subsection,  in particular, this and the following  paragraphs,\noo{\refp{pa:SchelerA}-\refp{pa:SchelerZ},} are due to Max Scheler,  in particular, \citetit{MaxForm}, \citetit{MaxAnthro}.  The main difference  consists in that Scheler is concerned almost exclusively with the hierarchy of  ethical values.  Yet, except for the aspect of temporality and transcendence,  the characterisation of the differences between various levels, as well as the  levels themselves, are very similar.  Another difference, appearing in  \ref{sub:mit}, the entire \refp{pa:notSchelerA}, concerns the relation between  different levels which here, unlike with Scheler, is not just that of  \co{founding}.}  A momentaneous elation, a simple joy over some particularevent which passes in an instant, can be as natural and authentic as superficial.It does not last, it does not reach the depth of the person, it is contextual andlocalised.  A peace of soul, a joy of life, humility of sainthood are\co{experienced} without any such localisation, independently even from thecontext where they may happen to become \co{manifest}. Entering the \hoa, their\co{signs} give a deep, spiritual satisfaction which is as \co{clear} as it isundefinable.% \citet{Fun I love but too much Fun%   is of all things the most loathsome.  Mirth is better than Fun \& Happiness is%   better than Mirth -- I feel that a Man may be happy in This World.}{BlakeLet}{}%   Letter to Rev.  Dr.  Trusler, 23.08.1799 [used in III.non-attach]}\co{Vagueness} means also that the \co{clarity} of the \co{signs} is merelyindicative, alluding, as if inviting, rather than forcefully demanding, imposingits \co{objective} presence. It is calm and spreads calmness.  As Plotinus saysit: \citet{The Good is gentle and friendly and tender, and we have it present  when we but will.}{Plotinus}{V:5.12\noo{33-34; The Good is in Plotinus the    \co{absolute origin}, the \co{one}.}}  \co{Vagueness} of the \co{signs} and\co{experience} of the higher levels is just another side of the lack ofdefinite \co{objective} correlates.  And this means that they are less relative,they are less restricted to particular regions of Being, are able to embracemore varied \co{experiences}.  Eventually, the \co{invisibles} are \co{absolute}-- free from any limits of \co{objectivity}, not relative to any particularregion of Being.\label{pa:constantVaried} The lack of \co{objective} determinations, in turn, means that the higher levels of \co{experience} aremore constant, remaining unchanged underneath the variations of lower levels.A particular \co{mood} can allow a variety of sensations which do not change the\co{mood}.  A \co{quality of life} will remain the same irrespectively of thevariation of particular \co{moods} and \co{impressions}.  Conformance to the\co{absolute command}\noo{, sainthood or love,} will remain unaffected by anyvariation in particular \co{moods}, \co{thoughts} and may \co{incarnate} intovery different \co{qualities of life}. And even a failure inconformance leaves the validity of the \co{command} unaffected.\pa The higher we move in the hierarchy of levels, the further are the \co{signs} removed from the signified.  At the level of \co{immediacy}the two coincide, while \co{invisibles} never coincide with the\co{signs} which \co{manifest} them, remaining essentially\co{transcendent}, that is, being \co{experienced} {\em always and only} as\co{non-actual} pure \co{commands}.\ftnt{A phenomenological analogycould be to say that the \co{signs} at the higher levels have more intentional character, they are more \co{clearly} directed \thi{toward something} than are the \co{signs} at the lower levels. Yet, this \thi{something} becomes at the same time less and less identifiable and escapes completely phenomenological reductions.}%\label{nonreactive}This is an aspect of non-reactivity of higher \co{experiences}.  Sensations arepure reactions, the \co{sign}, coinciding with the presence of the signified, issimply the elicited reaction.  \co{Moods} are already affected by the\co{presence} of non-\co{actuality} which defers the possible reaction andrenders it partially indeterminate. Yet, although what an \co{impression}announces can still hide behind it, the \co{impression} itself is \thi{given},it is reactive.  The \co{qualities of life} are passive but are not reactions toany specific situations. They announce something which can be only accepted,though what the acceptance means in practice is far removed from the\co{quality} itself. \co{Commands} and \co{inspirations} have no reactiveelement at all, being completely independent from any particular beings andregions of Being.The non-reactive character of \co{signs} is proportional to (can be\wo{measured} by) the extent to which they are influenced by our attention andwill.\noo{ The lower \co{signs} are least affected by it -- the presence of pain  is not affected by paying attention to it or not.  In fact, the reactive  character of sensation means that, in a sense, one cannot influence it by  turning attention away, because reaction is exactly the amount of attention  paid.  The presence of highest \co{signs}, on the other hand, demands  respectful attention, attentive presence of mind. We should probably use  another word, for instance, \co{openness}.    \co{Openness} should not be confused with the possibility of control by the  \co{acts} of will. In fact, they are inversely proportional.  }\label{pa:SchelerZ}The significance of the lowest \co{signs} can be to high extend determined bythe will. One can lessen the feeling of pain, virtually removing its relevance,by an effort of will to overcome it, for instance, by turning away one'sattention and concentrating on something else. And, of course, one can easilyproduce painful \co{experiences}, just like one can arrange circumstances so asto produce pleasant effects for sight, touch or taste. To some extent, one canalso arrange the circumstances so that they will produce agreeable or repulsive\co{impressions}; one can have some knowledge about kinds of circumstances whichresult in particular \co{moods}.  But the higher we move in the hierarchy oflevels, the less power one has over the presence or absence of the respective\co{signs}, not to mention their signified correlates. One can try to lead one'slife so as to give it a specific \co{quality}, but this \co{quality} is neverentirely under our control. One can crave happiness without ever achieving it,while the regrettable \co{qualities} of one's life can be impossible for one tochange. (One can, of course, always do something, but the eventual effects ofone's \co{acts} and \co{actions} are not determined by one's intentions.) Withrespect to the deepest aspects of being like holiness, despair, \co{love}, one'swill has nothing to say. They are \co{gifts} which one can neither refuse norprovoke, one can neither cause their \co{presence} nor make them disappear. Atmost, one can try to ignore them which is simply pretending that they are notthere -- apparently without any immediate consequences but, in the long run,affecting one in the deepest way. On the other hand, their \co{manifestations},which do not depend on one's will either, require a kind of attention, say,\co{openness}, which is not any focusing of the will, but merely a humblecooperation with the hidden, primordial causes. We should emphasize here thedifference between the \co{presence} of \co{invisibles}, and their\co{manifestations} in \co{actual signs}. Their \co{presence}, the ontologicalfact, is independent of our attention and cooperation. But the experienced formof this \co{presence}, the character of their \co{manifestations}, isconditioned by \co{openness} and spiritual directness.\ftnt{The spiritual and  mystical writings abound in variations over the theme of inner concentration,  focused attention, presence of mind in the face of spiritual life.  ``Recueillement'' is a technical term of spirituality denoting the action or  fact of concentrating one's thought on spiritual life in detachment from  worldly preoccupations. In so far as it refers to \co{acts} or facts, it can  be concerned only with \co{manifestations}. Much of \thi{spirituality},  especially its degenerate and more hysteric versions, have never managed to  reach beyond the realm of \co{actual signs}. Book III considers the  \co{spiritual} dimension of \co{existence} in more detail.}\subsection{As above, so below} %\co{co-presence}}%\plan{The modes of manifestation}\noo{\noindent{\small{\begin{tabular}[h]{|llrl|} \hline\HH\ is &  & in \LL & \\ \hline\hline1. &  invisible &  -- & cannot be reduced to the \LL's categories \\   &  diffuse &  -- & unclear, since greater scope of transcendence : \\   &  unprovable  &    & has its own categories and \\   & indefinable   &    &  does not operate at the \LL's detail/scale, and \\   &            &   & hence is not ``needed'' to fix \LL's problems \\ \hline\ref{lev:manif}. &  revealed  &  -- & incarnation, hierophany  \\   &                    &  & in a single moment which then dominates life or\\   &   expressible  & -- & over time, through work, commitment \\   &  experienced & -- & if not as revelation, then as ``moods'', as meaningful/less \\ \hline3. &  inexhaustible &  --& does not determine a unique form of appearance\\   &                 &   & always allows more forms of expression \\   &  unpredictable & -- & uncontrollable, can always surprise \\ \hline4. &  reflected &  -- & disallows some forms of expression \\   &             &    & if they occur, it is not the same \HH\ any more \\   &   inviolable &  -- & within the narrower, the broader cannot                                      be changed \\   &               &    & it takes time (to change one's being) \\   &  restricts  & -- & doing \LL$_1$ violating \HH$_1$ may lead to impossibility \\   &         &    & of experiencing/expressing \LL$_2$ reflecting \HH$_2$ \\ \hline\end{tabular} %\qpa{Under 4. consider: The negative values at a higher level do {\em not} restrict the lower level(s) in any way.

But everylife is an unrepeatable \co{unity} which is not constituted by various parts andelements. All such parts and elements are but manifestations, but \co{actual}expressions of deeper aspects and, eventually, of the \co{unity}. Every\co{immanent} unity is \co{founded} in the \co{transcendence}, every\co{actuality} draws its vital juices from the \co{non-actual} roots. The\co{concrete unity} of \co{existence} will be discussed in Book III. Now, wewill review only the more formal aspects of this \co{unity}, namely, the co-presence of all levels and, in particular,  the \co{presence} of\co{invisibles} in \co{actual experiences}. \subsub{Presence and co-presence\noo{Mitgegebenheit}}\label{sub:mit}% and manifestation%%%% ??????\noo{\ad{\co{actuality} $\sim$ \co{simultaneity}}\co{actuality} $\sim$ \co{simultaneity}, i. e., number of different \co{distinctions} which can be there simultaneously: this number decreases along the hypostases (\co{actuality} \wo{diminishes}): \begin{enumerate}        \item \co{nothingness}=no sense        \item \co{chaos}=all,         \item \co{experience},\hoa=some (?7-9?),         \item\co{reflection}=1\end{enumerate}}\pa\label{rest} %[perhaps to \refp{acts}]It is common to distinguish various aspects of an act like, for instance, theintentional correlate, the pragmatic aspect, the ethical import. The\co{immediate} correlate of an \co{act} is its \co{object}.  But being involvedinto the context of some \co{action}, the \co{act} has always also some goal, ithas a pragmatic aspect. Whether the goal is immediate or remote does not changeits character as the \co{actual} objective intended by the \co{act}. We havethen distinguished between the \co{objective} goals and their \co{motivations}which, encircling the horizon of possible \co{actions}, are themselvescounterparts of \co{activities}, expressing the lived and, preferably, also thedeclared values, \refpp{pa:Zweck}. This level is much broader and comprises muchmore than merely ethical issues but, being the level of \co{mineness}, and henceof the relation to \co{not-mine}, it certainly embraces also the ethicalelement. Finally, every \co{act} is surrounded by the \co{rest}, \co{expressing}the \co{present} but \co{invisible aspects} which do not become thematically\co{actualised}, \ref{sub:invisibleSigns}, in particular, \refp{pa:restA}.Thus, every \co{immediacy} of an \co{act} expresses all the levels, carryingtheir \co{unity} in its structure.%Let us consider some more concrete examples.\pa%As said in \refpp{pa:constantVaried}, tThe higher levels of \co{experience} remain more constant and allow a large variation at the lower levels. The increased constancy (in the upward movement) is anexperiential counterpart of the co-presence of all levels. If I am in a good \co{mood}, I can accept a lot of small, insignificantannoyances which do not bring me out of this \co{mood}. In fact, the \co{mood} Iam in will influence the way I handle these small situations, it will remain\co{present} in all these \co{actual} situations.  Similarly, a person may remain generally dissatisfied with his life through all his particularexperiences; no positive event seems to be able to change this general\co{quality} of his life.  And again, this \co{quality} makes itself felt andefficient, \co{present}, in various ways in all concrete situations.  Perhaps,by finding negative aspects in any, even most positive experiences, perhaps, byawaiting always the inevitable end of such experiences, that is, awaiting alwaysfor a bitter and unwelcome continuation.  It would be too strong to say thatthis \co{quality} determines the character of all concrete experiences.  But itcasts its shadow over them, it moulds them in a specific way so that they seemto conform to the general scheme of things which pollutes all\co{actual} experiences.But one should be careful with the criterion of constancy when applied to thehighest level.  For instance, the \co{quality of life} of St.~Francis, hisamiability and goodness seem to have accompanied him from the very childhood allhis life, while with respect to his sainthood, the dream on the way to theFourth Crusade marks a break and begins a new chapter. St.~Paul, before andafter the vision on the way to Damascus, was the same person and many\co{qualities} (zeal, dedication, \fre{je ne sais quoi}) where present in hislife before as much as after the conversion.  The constancy of \co{invisibles}is different from the possible constancy (and transience) of their\co{manifestations}.  It is not relative to one's life but consists intranscending the temporal dimension and the categories of \co{mineness}.  Thereis nothing like \thi{{\em my} sainthood} or \thi{{\em your} sainthood}, andsainthood remains sainthood whether it is \co{manifested} or not, or whether itis \co{manifested} in one person or in another.  And yet, the \co{invisibles}are \co{present} in \co{any experience} as its deepest aspects, the\co{invisible} personal traits, the source which does not create the specificdetails of \co{actual} situation but merely lends it an aura and puts a personalsignature underneath. \co{Manifestations} are only particularly intense and\co{visible signs} of this \co{presence}. The constancy of \co{invisibles} is,in fact, independent from any personal and \co{actual manifestations} -- it istheir \co{eternal} validity.% The higher need not lower ?\noo{The previous paragraph was concerned not so much with \co{an actual experience} as with \co{experiences}, like \thi{two weeks in Prague}, which span over longer periods of time. To the extent such a longer period of time becomes \co{an experience}, it will involve variations of  more minute \co{experiences} which belong to the lower levels. But we can also see the co-presence within \co{an actual experience}. }\pa\label{pa:notSchelerA}\label{notfounding} Now, higher levels do not create the specific contentsof the lower ones nor vice versa.  Each level, determined by its specifictension between \co{actuality} and \co{non-actuality}, has its owncharacteristic contents and ways of their presentation.  The \co{invisibles} donot determine one's life.  The \co{quality} of one's life does not determine the\co{actual} situations one gets involved in.  The \co{actual} \co{moods} and\co{impressions} do not determine any particular sensations.  In fact, the fullrange of lower phenomena can be \co{experienced} along with any configuration ofthe higher aspects.  In short, the higher aspects of \co{experience} do not\co{found} the contents of the lower ones, in the technical sense of phenomenologicalfounding (i.e., as necessary conditions).% founding? - relatively yes; higher changes character of lowerBut the higher aspects influence crucially the lower ones, they sink in andpenetrate whatever  qualities may emerge at the lower levels. An annoyance is an annoyance but it changes its character when encountered in a good or in a bad \co{mood}. A joy or sadness of a pessimist is different from the respective feelings of an optimist. The drive and energy of life of a saint are different from the similar \co{qualities} in the life of a person nourished by negation, hatred or bitterness. %A joyful feeling of a person who is generally dissatisfied with life will stillbe joyful.  Yet, this joy will be limited to the level of \co{actuality}.  Itwill be, so to speak, \thi{blocked} if it \thi{tries} to penetrate deeper intothe personal being; \thi{blocked} by a remainder of its transiency, by painfulmemories, or simply \thi{blocked} by the general dissatisfaction with life.  Inother words, it won't be able to spread over the totality of the personal being,but will remain localised.  You might have heard the difference between a short,nervous, almost involuntary laughter which seems to be disturbed by theimmediate bad conscience, as if there was no {\em real} reason to laugh and onedid it only because one could not resist it, and, on the other hand, a cordial,warm, full-blooded laughter which seems to flow from the very bottom of theheart, in which the laughing face is but an expression of the soul whichembraces the whole world with its hearty laughter.  In the former case, the\co{actual} level is not in conformance with the higher level of one's being andthe inability for a hearty laughter modifies the \co{actual} one.  It is stilllaughter, over the same funny thing, but it testifies to another personalinvolvement than the latter.This penetration of lower levels by the higher ones in \co{an  actual experience} reminds a bit of the \thi{founding} relation.  But it isnot founding because the \co{actuality} of a given lower aspect, of laughter orjoy, is not conditioned by the \co{presence} of any particular higher aspect --the former is only {\em modified} by the latter.  This modification, this\co{rest} and aura which the higher aspects extend to the lower, witness to theunity of \co{an experience} involving the aspects of all levels.  This is theform of \co{presence} of higher, eventually \co{invisible}, aspects in all\co{experience}.%evil look vs. ? good look, other examples... ?\newpa \pa An \co{immediate experience}, an \co{act} of \co{reflection} is obviouslyinvolved in the context of the \co{actual} situation.  As phenomenologists show,especially with respect to perceptions, the \co{actual} contents are surroundedby other, as they say, \ger{mitgegeben} (co-present) aspects which do not fall within thefocus of consciousness but which, nevertheless, are \co{present}.  Focusingmy sight on the entry door of a house, I still see, albeit only subconsciously,only in the corner of my eye, the windows immediately to the left and right ofthe door.  Furthermore, although I see only the front of the house, its sidesare also included, \ger{mitgegeben}, in the \co{actual} phenomenon.  Thequestion now is where to stop such inclusions.  I know that behind the housethere is a park.  It does not seem to be given, but is it \ger{mitgegeben} too,or not?  And in the park, there is a lake, behind which there is\ldots It seemsimplausible to assume that all this is \ger{mitgegeben}, for then all thingsever experienced, unlimited if not infinite number of them, would belong toevery phenomenon. There is the \hoa, which seems to circumscribe the scope of\ger{Mitgegebenheit}. In I:\ref{sub:time}, \refpf{pa:twoTimesA}, we had theproblem with the phenomenology of time, which did not account for the continuityacross the limit of \co{actuality} towards the remote past. Likewise, here weencounter similar phenomenological break in which what is \ger{mitgegeben}dissolves in the emptiness surrounding the \hoa. And as in the case of time, soalso here, there is a \co{distinction} but there is no border because we have todo with a continuity of \co{experience}.\ger{Mitgegebenheit} of the \co{objective} (or, if one prefers, noematic) characterhas its limit which is the limit of the \hoa. Somewhere, at the end of the frontwall, behind the house, behind the lake, behind the park, \co{objects} and\co{complexes} cease to be \ger{mitgegeben}, there are no more \co{objects} and\co{complexes} which gradually disappear behind the limits of the \co{actual}phenomenon. Of course, it is enough to redirect one's attention to bring in other, new or expected \co{objects} and connect them to the ones \co{actual} atthe moment, but we are now considering an abstract, isolated \co{actuality} of\co{an experience}, so let us not stroll, not move sight around.What is \ger{mitgegeben} behind this line are no more \co{objects} but~\ldots\co{moods}, \co{impressions}, feelings, intuitions, \co{qualities}.\ger{Mitgegebenheit} becomes eventually \co{presence} of \co{invisibles}.\co{Moods}, feelings, \co{qualities}, etc. are the concrete forms under whichthe potential infinity (of things, of \co{experiences}, of \ger{Lebenswelt}) is\co{present} in every experience.  If we were to use the objectivistic way of speaking, we might say: they do not bring in any \co{objects} but onlyunified \co{signs} which comprise the overwhelming number of possible\co{distinctions} within the limits of the \hoa; although they do not make anymore \co{objects} \co{actual},%\ftnt{Some psychologists claim that human perception is%limited to at most 7-9 objects at a time.}, they make them \co{present}, by providing \co{actual signs} which are nothingelse than a comprised multiplicity of \co{objects}.  But the objectivistic wayof speaking loses its adequacy as behind the line of \co{moods} and\co{qualities}, behind the line where even the \co{actual} feelings becomeblurred and indistinct, there are still \co{invisibles}, the \co{inspirations}which oversee the whole \co{actual} situation.We can illustrate it on our figure from~\refp{fig:levels}, p.\pageref{fig:levels}.The non-\co{actual} points on the circle (above the line of \co{actuality}) areall reflections of the \thi{objective} points from the line. They belong to the\co{actual experience} but only in the form of the \co{signs} on the circle. Andthe closer to the sphere of \co{invisibles} and the pole of the circle, thedenser condensation of these images, with the pole reflecting the infinity ofthe line. This density of the images, the density of the increasing multitude ofremote points of the line comprised into decreasing segments of the circle,would correspond now not only to the inseparability of \co{invisibles} but alsoto the unobjectifiable content of the \co{signs} of the higher levels \co{present}in the \co{actual experience}. \pa The \co{concrete, invisible presence} seems to underlie the intensity with whichMerleau-Ponty searches for it in the structure of \co{actual  experiences}.  Although we might disagree with the focus onsensibility and the hunt for the \thi{pure, raw, pre-reflective experience}, thereis, nevertheless, much we can borrow from his descriptions.  \citet{Visible  actuality is not {\em in} time and space nor, of course, {\em beyond} them,  for there is nothing in front of it, after it nor around it, which might  compete with its visibility.  And yet it is not alone, it is not everything.  Precisely: it occludes a further view, that is, both time and space extend  around it and are {\em behind} it, hiding, in depth.  In this way visible can  fill or embrace me only because I who see it, do not see it from the depth of  nothingness, but from its own interior, and seeing it I am also seen.  Weight,  density, content of every colour, every sound, every tangible tissue, of  actuality and of the very world come from that that the one who receives them  feels as if he emerged from them through a kind of spiral or splittingmovement, being originary homogeneous %\he{jednorodny} !not homogenouswith them, from that he is a self-directed sensibility which, in turn, is in hiseyes as if doubling and unfolding of his bodily tissue.  Space and time ofthings are splinters %\he{odpryski}of his own, of his spatiality and temporality, and not any multiplicity of unitsseparated synchronically and diachronically; it is a relief combined from thatwhich is simultaneous and that which follows after itself, spatial andtemporal mash %\he{miazga}in which, on the way of differentiation, units emerge.  Things are now not inthemselves, on their place and time, here, there, now, sometime; they exist onlyon the border of this spatial and temporal radiation emanating mysteriously frommy sensibility.  Their content is not the content of a pure object observed bythe mind from a distance; I experience it from inside, as I am among the things,and they communicate through me as a feeling thing.  Actuality, visibility -- asthe veil of memories for the psychoanalysts -- has for me an absolute valor onlybecause of its hidden, unlimited content of past, future, and that which isbeyond it and which it announces but also hides.}{VisInvis}{Inquiry andintuition;p.120-121} \pa%\co{Actuality} = pure immanence; \co{presence} = imman. + transc. \ldotsJust like we have equated \co{transcendence} with the non-\co{actual},\co{non-actual} and eventually the \co{invisible}, we can equate \co{immanence}with pure \co{actuality}. Both terms are only abstractions which can hardly bedissociated from each other.  \co{Immanence}, \co{actuality} and\co{visibility}, arises at the limit of the process of differentiation, as thefinal stage of encircling the \thi{hidden, unlimited content} within the \hoa.Although it allows \co{reflection} to oppose it to the \co{transcendence}, thelatter does not disappear in the process of \co{actualisation}, it penetratesthe \co{actuality} with all the levels lying above it.  \co{Presence} is anexpression of this insoluble involvement of \co{immanence} into\co{transcendence}, of the fact that \citeti{immortals are mortal, mortals are  immortal: each lives the death of the other, and dies their  life.}{Heraclitus}{DK 22B62}The eventual \co{transcendence}, the \co{origin} is never accessible to thecategories of \co{immanence}, is \thi{neither this nor that}, is never\co{visible} and yet, is always most deeply \co{present}. \co{Self} is, afterall, its \co{trace}, the \co{trace} of \co{birth}, and the eventual terminus ofthis \co{trace} is the \co{actual subject}. All levels are \co{present} in every\co{actual experience}, and the \co{invisibility} of the \co{origin} is whatremains the same also across all temporal \co{experiences}.  Using thecategories of \co{reflective} oppositions, the \co{actual} is the opposite, andhence incommensurable, with the \co{non-actual}.  But, in fact, the most\co{transcendent}, the ultimately \co{invisible} is that which penetrates all\co{visibility}, which is most intimately, even if not \co{visibly},\co{present}, and which therefore is the most \co{immanent}.  The \co{rest} ofthe \co{origin} remains \co{present} throughout the life, in every \co{actual}situation, but only as the \co{rest} -- it cannot be grasped, but it gives tasteto everything within the \hoa.\paThe father said: {\wo{Place this salt in water, and come to me tomorrow morning.} %The son did as he was told. %Next morning the father said, \wo{Bring me the salt which you put in the water.}%The son looked for it, but could not find it; for the salt, of course, had dissolved. %The father said, \wo{Taste some water from the surface of the vessel.

It has little to do with the\co{precision} and determinacy of the \co{objects}, although such associationswill often be involved in the common usage of this word. A pure, isolatedsensation, a \co{precise object} or concept, is not \co{concrete}, in fact, itis very abstract. It lacks all the layers of \co{non-actuality} which wouldanchor it in \co{concrete} \co{experience}, that is, in \co{experience} of aperson. It is exactly the \co{experiences} where things get {objectified} and\co{externalised}, where they lose connection and relevance for you,\co{experiences} of, say, impersonal nature, which are least \co{concrete}.Typically, they will involve very \co{precisely} discriminated \co{objects} butthe price for this \co{precision} is the loss of \co{concrete clarity}.\co{Clarity}, not \co{precision}, is the characteristic feature of\co{concreteness}. And it is grounded in the personal character of\co{experience}, that is, in the character which \co{experience} gains from the\co{presence} of the \co{non-actual} aspects, eventually, from the \co{presence}of the \co{invisible}, most personal \co{aspects}.We, or generally, living beings, are those who bring \co{non-actuality} into theworld -- \co{non-actuality}, that is, subjectivity.\ftnt{\wo{Subjectivity} must  be taken here in the most broad and generous sense of this term. It is, in  fact, opposite to our \co{subjectivity} which is pure \co{immediacy}  \co{dissociated} from the equally \co{immediate objectivity}. Here it is  simply that which is opposed to the \co{actuality} of the \thi{givens}, the  overhead brought into the situation by the participants and not any  \co{objective} facts. Cf.~\ref{sub:objsubj}.}  One \co{actual experience} maydiffer significantly from another one by its \co{objective} content, itsparticular meaning, etc.  But every such \co{experience}, every meeting with aparticular, \co{actual} being, is at the same time a thoroughly \co{concrete}\co{confrontation} with Being in its full and undisguised \co{presence}.  ThisBeing can seem veiled by the \co{actuality}, since it never appears, is never\co{visible} for \co{reflection}, but, as a matter of fact, this\co{non-actuality}, this \thi{veil} of \co{invisibility} is its true and onlyform of \co{presence}, if you like, the only mode of our access to it. \citet{If  coincidence is lost, then it is not an accident; if Being remains hidden, then  this is precisely its very feature and no unveiling will allow us understand  it.}{VisInvis}{p.128}\paThe \co{presence} of all higher levels in every \co{actual experience} reflectsthe order of ontological \co{founding}. It can be seen as the inverse of theepistemic founding which begins with the \co{actual dissociations} of\co{reflection} and strives after the known, because \co{experienced}, butapparently abstract and unthinkable, \co{unity}.Even if \co{presence} coincides in objective time with the \co{actuality} of\co{an experience}, the two are very different. Primarily, \co{present} are\co{invisibles}, while only \co{objects} and \co{visible} contents can be\co{actual}. The difference concerns both the mode of presentation and thecontents. One might be tempted to say: \co{actuality} is the {objectified  expression} of \co{presence} and \co{presence} is the \co{non-objectifiable}\co{actuality}.  Or else, \co{presence} is the witness whose testimony is notreducible to the epistemological, that is, \co{reflective} categories of\co{actuality} and \co{objectivity}.%not really: presence = actuality of invisible; %  while actuality = presence of visibleReferring \co{presence} of \co{invisibles} to the ontological \co{foundation},we should keep in mind that \co{actuality} is only the ultimate narrowing ofreality which extends far beyond the \hoa.  The \co{virtual invisibles},necessarily involved into the \co{actuality} as they are, are thoroughly real.It is not so that only the \co{actual signs} and expressions lend them anyreality. In fact, the \co{actuality} of \co{objects} is only the \co{sign} ofthe \co{founding} reality and as such (as well as by its correlation with\co{reflection}) can be considered to have more epistemic, rather thanontological, character.  \co{Presence} is \co{concrete} reality and\co{actuality} only its abstract, \co{precise} modification.  \co{Virtuality} isalready a fully consummated reality of \co{invisible} -- not merely its latency,not a mere potentiality for \co{actualisation}.  It is effective and experiencedeven if it is \co{present} only in its deepest, most \co{virtual} form, even ifit never reaches the level of \co{actualisation} in a \co{manifesting}\co{sign}. One can live a deeply joyful and satisfying life without any direct,plain thoughts of it, without even any frequent \co{actual experiences} of joyand satisfaction. Yet, even then one will know that one's life is satisfying,although one may be unable to explain \co{precisely} why and how. Not allreality must become \co{actual}; most important \co{aspects} of it never do.  \noo{Yet, these qualities may be \co{present} in most situations -- not as\co{objective} parts of the situations, not as their thematic contents, but astheir dim qualities, as an indefinable \co{rest} of personal presence.}\noo{Although the \co{present} \co{invisibles} need not become \co{manifested}, thereis no \co{manifestation} without \co{presence}.}%A \co{revelation} presupposes \co{incarnation}, that is,%\co{presence}.%%Incarnation should be reserved for spiritual ... ?\pa Critique of \co{actuality} has always proceeded from the standpoint of\co{non-actuality}. This can be taken in the direction of {subjectivity} (asendowing the \co{actual} givens with meaning if not also with being), in thedirection of \co{absoluteness} (as transcending the relativity of \herenow), inthe direction of \co{vague imprecision} (as transcending the \co{precision} of\co{immediacy}).  We thus see how a series of examples conform to the same,albeit very rough and general, pattern.  Kierkegaard's critique of Hegel fromthe point of \thi{extreme subjectivity} and existential relevance, Bergson'scritique of space and objectified time of science from the point of livedduration, Heidegger's critique of the epistemically oriented \thi{metaphysics of  beings} from the point of \thi{Being} and fundamental ontology, Derrida'scritique of\noo{ -- or shall we say, crusade against --} the \thi{metaphysics of  actuality} from the point of inter-permeability of opposites andundefinability of concepts, the general dissatisfaction with the conceptualanalyses from the point of concrete existence, even mystics' reservationsagainst philosophical theology from the point of \thi{ineffable unity}, are allessentially the same critique of epistemic focus on \co{actuality} from thepoint of ontological foundation which escapes \thi{objectivity} and merges withthe personal origins. The list could be prolonged indefinitely, so let us onlyadd the antique, Platonic and neo-Platonic, and later Christian opposition,between the world of senses and the world of spirit. The recurring praise of therenunciation of the former for the latter is based on the conflation of\thi{senses} with the \co{immediate actuality}, with the founded and merelytransitory (which is at once taken as \thi{unreal}) and, on the other hand, of\thi{spirit} with the supra-personal, yet always somehow personal,\co{non-actuality} of the \co{founding} (and therefore \thi{true and real})\co{origin}.\noo{As always, searching for concreteness one can easily yield to  the temptation to identify \co{vague} and deep elements of \co{another world}  with the plain \co{visibles} of \co{this world}. The crusade against senses  carries strong elements of misunderstood spirituality.}%%%% Here some stronger transition to UNITY = visible vs. invisvisible%%%% should be made\noo{ LONG \pa The \co{presence}, the \co{presence} of \co{invisibles} announces  something which not only is not \co{objective} but which is not  {objectifiable}.  It can never be reduced to the categories of \co{actuality}  and \co{visibility}.  It seems dim, diffuse, it is \co{vague} and  \co{imprecise}.  It can not be pointed to, proved, for these are categories of  \co{visibility} which do not apply.  The undefinability of this \co{presence}  reflects also the fact that \co{invisibles} do not influence our life in  \co{precise}, definite ways.  \citet{Grace does not perform any works; it is    too subtle for that and is as far from performing any works as heaven is    from earth.}{EckGermSerm}{ DW 38, W 29 \noo{p.118}} It takes a truly German  turn of the phrase to deny, for this reason, its reality: since it is not  \co{visibly} active, since it is not \ger{wirksam}, it is not \ger{wirklich}.    \pa This \co{presence} is experienced and also \co{expressible} -- the life is  an \co{expression} of this \co{presence}.  A most peaceful, ordinary life,  occupied almost exclusively with prosaic, daily matters, is an \co{expression}  of the thorough \co{presence} of \co{invisibles}, which penetrate the  \co{actuality} of apparent trivialities.%  And, at the same time, it is \co{present} as something inexhaustible, as a  constant overflow which never reaches its final expression.  Drawing eventual  consequences amounts, often, just to meeting the bitter end, but the  \co{presence} does not signify any end, does not imply any consequences, does  not mean any conclusion.  It is a constant opening which, however, is not  arbitrary and indeterminate even though it is indefinable.  It is an opening  of a field where every particular \co{expression} is just an instance, a  token, an indication which is neither determined nor exhausts the potential.    The \co{invisible} can announce its \co{presence} in the most unpredictable  and unexpected way, in an \co{act} or \co{action} which surprises \co{me}, as  \co{I} would never expect \co{myself} to be capable of such a deed. Relying on  \co{one's Self} is just to allow \co{oneself} to be thus surprised and, at the  same time, have full trust that such surprises are positive and valuable  \co{expressions} of something \co{I} cannot fully see.  Whether one lets it  flow through or denies it, whether one rests assured of its power or else  seeks desperately after its \co{visible} signs, and eventually just after  \co{visible signs}, is another matter -- the matter which in no way can change  the fact of this \co{presence}.    presence vs. actuality    ontolo. vs. epist.    unity vs. ideal    concrete vs. precise    \subsub{The ontological founding}\label{sub:copresence}%%%% co-presence of all levels in an experience%%%% this was 2.5.2 in ch. II%%% add also reference to horizontal transc. = reflection of vertical  \pa In the most abstract sense, the co-presence of all levels may be seen as  the fact that gradual narrowing of the focus of attention does not  \thi{remove} the surrounding context.  I direct my \co{reflection} towards the  \co{actual object} but this \co{object} is obviously pulled out of the context  of other, simultaneous \co{objects}.  As psychologists maintain, we can keep  simultaneously some 6-9 \co{objects} in our attention without blurring the  \co{distinctions} between them.  (Such simultaneity might also be taken as the  limit of the \hoa.)  All these \co{objects}, however, are not given here  \thi{out of the void}.  They, too, are surrounded by something, although this  something does not have the same character of \co{precise objectivity}.  It is  a constellation of \co{moods}, feelings, of subconscious perceptions and  things sensed though not focused on, in the background.  In a more abstract  formulation, the \co{actual objects} are surrounded by the \co{chaos} of a  multitude of \co{distinctions} which, however, are not \thi{given}.  Eventually, even this \co{chaos} is underlied, or surrounded, by the  all-embracing \co{nothingness}, the ultimate background from which all  \co{distinctions} emerge or, as may be perhaps claimed about the \co{actual    experience}, into which all dissolve and disappear.%\tit{\co{Presence} = ontological founding}    \pa All more \co{precise} and \co{actual} aspects (though not necessarily all  contents) of \co{an experience} are \co{founded} in the \co{non-actual},  eventually \co{invisible} aspects of our being. This relation of ontological  \co{founding} is experienced as \co{presence}.    The \co{presence} of \co{invisibles} is real -- effective -- irrespectively of  our \co{attentive reflection}, irrespectively of \co{visible signs}.  \co{Reflection} and attention paid to it can only modify the character of this  \co{presence}, but not annihilate it.    One may never experience moments of \co{revelation}; one may almost never have  feelings of meaningfulness or meaninglessness, feelings of the \co{quality of    one's life}, and even when such feelings appear vaguely at the horizon, one  may easily ignore them. One may never feel the need to talk about such things  and, indeed, the stronger the need to analyse and dissect them, the stronger  the indication that something goes wrong. One may ignore completely the  \thi{dreams}, \thi{ideals}% like those from \refp{pa:manifest1},   and yet, the more intense attempts to ignore them, are but manifestations of  the more intensely felt \co{presence}.%the more violently will they emerge %from the shadow once they reach the surface.The same thing, the same \co{act} performed by two different persons may be entirely different. A simple ``Hello, how are you today?'' may have infinite variations. One will easily distinguish between the \thi{what} of an \co{act} or a particular situation, and the \thi{how} of its \thi{aura}, its \thi{character}, its particular \thi{form}. And as much as one can say about the former, as little one can grasp of and put the finger on the latter. The \co{rest} which escapes \co{objective} determination may seem negligible -- \co{objectively} it {\em is} negligible. Even if it is not ignored, it may witness to a mere \co{mood}, mere \co{complex} of the context. But eventually, this \co{rest} carries with it the depth of \co{invisible presence}, the source of the personal being. Our \co{reflection} is defenseless against this \co{presence} which always escapes the scrutiny of \co{attentive} look. %\subpa\subsub{Signs of presence}%{The \co{presence} of \co{invisible} -- manifestations}%\paThe co-presence of all the levels is, in the sense, what constitutes the \co{unity} of our being.

These were the \co{signs}, that is, events consummated within the \hoa, the extreme forms of \co{manifestation} of \co{invisibles} which I call \wo{\co{revelations}}. These are rare events and the \co{presence} of \co{invisibles} is not limited to such \co{experiences}.\pa\label{pa:manifest3} \act  The \co{signs} of \co{actuality}, \co{moods}, \co{impressions} or even \co{concepts}, reveal unity beyond the \co{actual} determinations. Their very presence points, \co{vaguely} and indefinitely but still beyond the \hoa. The silly questions like \wo{How does all this hang together?}, \wo{What keeps all the pieces in one universe?}, \wo{Is the universe really one?} ask for a principle or a unity beyond all the bits and pieces. %In a bit less limited temporal context, one%can be overcome by the particular moods and feelings which seem to%reveal the deepest \co{qualities of one's life}; the feelings of%meaninglessness or fullness, of constant failure or strength, of%general dissatisfaction or joy.  %One tries sometimes to express such%feelings, saying \wo{My life is \ldots}, \wo{The world is \ldots},%either to oneself or to an accidental person met in the evening during%a few days visit on the other end of the earth.  No matter what the (im)possible answer might be, it is, ofcourse, inadequate, inaccurate, incomplete.  But it is alsoimmediately recognised as such -- the distance separating itfrom what it tries to capture is given, too.  The impassability ofthis distance is just an indication of the essentially \co{non-actual}character of what the \co{vague} intuition behind such questions indicates.There are also, some particular \co{moods} and \co{experiences} whichseem to address something much deeper than the \co{actual} moment inwhich they appear.\ftnt{Moods in Heidegger's \wo{Sein und Zeit}might be read as having this role.  \la{Nausea} of Sartre, the emptyirrelevance of the world of Camus' stranger, the whole range ofexistentialist literature has been occupied with particular feelings,all expressing a particular way of experiencing and \citef{futile searching for the  meaning of life at the bottom of empty soul.}{HerbertAnts}{Narcissus}  The popularity of this schooloriginated certainly in the fact that it managed somehow to linkphilosophy with life.  But what kind of life!}%The variety of religious experiences, described in such a detail by James, find place within the \hoa, and it is their improbable intensity and irresistible power which bears witness to their \co{origin} far beyond the \co{actual} situation. Underneath the insufficiency of theintentional, thematic content of such \co{experiences}, there lurks anindefinable feeling of an ineffable \co{rest}.  The indeterminate\co{presence}, the underlying \co{quality} is interwoven into thetemporality of \co{moods} and \co{impressions}.\pa\label{pa:manifest2} \mine In a yet broader context, the \co{qualities of life},ineffable as they are, find at least twofold \co{expression}.On the one hand, one may try to say something like \wo{The life is \ldots}, \wo{The world is \ldots}. The eternal questions, the impossible answers. Like the expressions of \co{actual moods}, they are inevitably incomplete and inadequate, but this inadequacy is given and known, too, thus witnessing to the intuition of the inaccessibility of whatever they may try to \co{express} and pointing again beyond, but now beyond the horizon of \co{my life}.More genuinely, the \co{qualities} find their \co{expression} in theway we conduct our life, in the projects and goals to which wededicate ourselves, or else, in the existential situation in which we find ourselves.  A person's lifeis primarily an \co{expression}, an \co{expression} of something whichone may, sometimes, try to capture in general and more or less vaguedescriptions, in a biography or a novel, in an eulogy of another'slife, in an epitaph at a friend's funeral. (Of all the literary genres, I suppose, the need for biographies or autobiographies will never abate.) One can start to list theachievements and fascinations, the projects and activities whichconstituted the main stations of one's life, but any such listing may,at best, indicate vaguely the intended \co{quality}, leaving alwaysthe \co{rest} to the understanding of every person.A word, a sentence, a book is never enough -- a simple, \co{actual}\co{sign}, or a collection thereof, is never sufficient to communicatethe way in which this particular life \co{expressed} the subtlecomplexity of \co{incarnate} \co{invisibles}, its unity.  On the otherhand, if we know the person, then a short remark, a simple action, avague gesture can suffice to indicate the relevant \co{quality}.  Sucha \co{sign}, however, is readable only to those who already know whatit means, that is, who know the person and his life.\subpa After a long and active life, having (or having not) achievedthe status and independence, looking back at the failures andsuccesses and concluding that, eventually, everything has turned outto the best (or the worst), one may still find the disquiet anddissatisfaction which one recognises as one of the first feelingswhich motivated one's incessant search and activity throughout one'swhole life.  There are no reasons for that, there are no \co{visible}reasons to feel dissatisfied.  And yet \ldots the dissatisfaction ismore real than it ever was before.  What is missing?  \co{Nothing},that is, everything.  The whole life seems to have been dedicated toinessential activities, to achievements of irrelevant goals.  Whetherthis feeling downs on one or not, what it signifies might have been\co{present} all the time, the whole life has been but an\co{expression} doubled by this \co{vague} intuition.  It has,perhaps, never been \co{actually} focused upon, never \co{actually}felt, and yet it has always been \co{present}.} % end \noo{ LONG\subsub{Traces}Distinguishing thus ontological \co{presence} from its \co{manifestations}through the \co{actual signs}, we want to emphasise its independence from such\co{manifestations}. But these two\noo{ -- ontological \co{presence} and its\co{manifestations} --} express only the extreme poles of the \co{unity} which is maintained throughout all the levels. % % There is yet another way in which \co{non-actuality} is \co{present} in the% \co{actual experiences}.%\co{Actualisation} amounts to \co{dissociation} of higher \co{nexuses} into more\co{actual} elements.  This \co{dissociation} proceeds only gradually and every\co{actual distinction} carries the character of the \co{nexus} from which itarose, as the \co{actual sign} of a continuous \co{trace}. Such \co{traces}connect not only the adjacent levels but traverse their whole hierarchy.\noo{  reaching from the \co{immediacy} all the way to the ultimate \co{origin}.} Wehave, for instance, seen in Book I how the \co{immediate objectivity} arises asa \co{trace} of \co{actuality}, \co{signification} and, eventually, the event of\co{confrontation}, how the objective time and space arise from the \nexus\ of\co{spatio-temporality} which leads back to (that is, emerges from) the\co{chaotic} simultaneity of \co{distinctions} following the \co{original  separation}, etc. The characteristic feature of a \co{trace} is that it cannotbe fully grasped within any single level, least of all, within the level of\co{reflective dissociation}.  It is \co{clearly} understood, it seems perfectly\co{visible}, yet what is so \co{visible} is only its \co{actual signs}, itsend-points. Any account of it leads beyond the comprehensibility of the\co{visible} elements.  We give now two more elaborate examples of \co{traces}:identity and truth.\subsubi{Identity}\label{sub:Identity}We have seen the variations of the identity notion  through thepreceding sections: in the idealization of \co{immediacy} and \co{actuality} tothe residual, self-identical \thi{substances}, in constitution of things aslimits of \co{distinctions}, in the \co{posited} \co{totalities}  {of the world} and \co{myself}, in the \co{unity} of \co{self}. % We will now gather the main aspects related to the notions of identity and, by% the same token, give an example of a thread which, going through all the levels, % illustrates their co-presence in every experience. These variations reflect only the different elements encountered on the\co{trace} of identity, as if different points marked on a continuous linepassing through all the levels.   Leaving and then returning to a room, I \co{re-cognise} the cup on the table asthe same which was there a while ago.  The cup \co{here-and-now}\ points to theone \co{there-and-then}.  True, it points in a very specific way making theidentification of the two immediate, but it does point nevertheless, that is, itis now a \co{sign as a sign}, a \co{sign} whose non-identity with -- thepotential distinction from -- the signified is given along with the veryidentity of the two. The difference is the difference of the \co{actuality}\herenow\ and the \co{actuality} \thth. Identity seems to connect the two,stretching across the time interval which separates them.  \co{An experience} ofidentity arises as an instance of a repetition which, in turn, seems topresuppose memory. So we will start with a few general remarks on that. Then,still in the preliminary fashion, we will comment briefly on the unnecessarilyexaggerated role of language in establishing identities. After thisintroduction, we will discuss in more detail various forms of identity.\subsubnonr{Memory}We forget many things.  But what does it mean?  Do they simply disappear,as if never happened?  Certainly not.  What we usually mean by memory is relatedto particular facts and \co{actual} events which are stored in the \co{precise}form ready to be fetched with a satisfactory exactitude of detail.  This abilityvaries greatly for it happens often that such \co{precise} things get dissolvedin subconsciousness and have to be fetched back, as it may happen inpsychoanalysis.  But probably not even Freudians would assume the possibility ofa total recall of everything that ever happened. Some things just get lost, notin the subconsciousness from which they might be restored in unchanged form, butin a complete \ldots \co{virtuality}.  They are not kept \thi{the way they were  experienced} but get as if \thi{compressed}, mingled with other contentslosing their rigidity and \co{precision} -- losing their identity.\pa\label{pa:memovirt} According to Piaget, memory is a function very similar tointelligence and \citet{the development of memory with age is the history of  gradual organisations closely dependent on the structuring activities of  intelligence.}{PiagetMem}{p.381 \citaft{PiagetPhil}{ p.75}} Can we knowsomething without remembering it? Can we remember something without knowingit?\noo{(That is, knowing what we remember; knowing that we remember $x$  involves rather obviously knowing also $x$.)} Such Wittgensteinian questionsdo not, perhaps, await any answers, but we may try. Knowing and rememberinginvolve both the ability to re-produce or re-cognise. Knowing Pythagoreantheorem requires, in particular, that I remember it, am able to state it ondemand. But it involves more than mere remembrance. What more? This is unclear,but it might be that I should also be able to use it in various situations, torecognise the situations where it does {\em not} apply, perhaps, also to justifyor prove it.  On the other hand, when I remember the theorem, is it possiblethat I do not know, do not understand it? In principle, this seems possible, Ican be able to re-state the theorem without, however, being able to discernadequate meaning in it, I just remember the formulation. If I am to apply it, orto decide if it is applicable, I can be forced to work through it again, try tore-call, or figure out anew, its meaning, the ways of its application, etc.It this sense, memory is only some minimal precondition of knowing or, asthe case may be, is only some residual rest which remains from richer knowledgeas its elements gradually disappear -- from memory.\pa What is this rest? What happened to the elements which disappeared? Even ifI forgot most of them, it is much easier to bring them forth in my understandingthan it is when learning the theorem for the first time. They did not disappearcompletely, they only as if waned away, but are still -- somewhere, somewhat --around. Consider now what happens when we are thinking. I can work intenselywith the theorem, setting its various elements explicitly \thi{before my eyes},trying to connect them, deduce consequences. This is the most active,\co{attentive} thinking. When, trying several times, I get stuck unable to reachthe desired solution, the best thing to do can be to forget the whole problemfor a while. To literally {\em forget} it, erase it from the horizon ofconscious attention. It happens almost typically that the solution, or a newcreative suggestion, will just appear, as if by its own force, after some time(cf.~\ref{sub:notunconscious}). \thi{Thinking} is obviously going on in thebackground while one is not thinking actively and deliberately. What istypically called \wo{a thought} is, more often than not, only an \co{actual}result of such a hidden process, a \co{precisely visible} formulation whichreminds more of a momentary revelation than of careful construction. Of course,careful constructions are helpful in obtaining such revelations, but for themost they concern only verification, adjustment and adequate formulation of\co{vague} contents which are \thi{given} to and not constructed by us (adequacybeing exactly the hardly definable proximity of the eventual formulation and thebarely \co{visible} image).\ftnt{Thus, just like \thi{nows} mark only particular  peaks of intensity in the flow of time, according to  I:\ref{sub:time}.\refp{pa:rest-flow}, so \thi{thoughts} are like \co{visible}  \thi{substantive parts} marking the resting-places between the \thi{transitive    parts} of the continuous -- and not necessarily conscious -- stream of  \thi{thinking}.} It should not be all too daring to propose that such a subconscious\thi{thinking} works not only with other materials which one could, if onewanted to, bring to \co{actual} attention but also with contents similar tothose which started to wane away but did not quite disappear from the memory. Infact, the creative solution one obtains in this way involves often exactly suchelements which were not available to immediate introspection. We might say,\thi{thinking} reaches here into deeper layers of memory than does the active,\co{attentively} controlled thinking.\citet{The image [\ger{Vorstellung}] of pain is not a picture [\ger{Bild}] and  {\em this} image is not replaceable in the language-game by anything we should  call a picture.

Try to describe what you are seeing (with your closed eyes)when you are trying to recollect Eiffel Tower. You end up describing what youwould draw if you were asked to, you end up describing a picture. But you do not{\em see} this picture. With your eyes closed, trying to recall Eiffel Tower,you are trying to \co{actualise} it as a picture. But what are you trying to\co{actualise}? What is \thi{there} to be \co{actualised}?  While \thi{picture}is what can be given as an \co{immediate object}, what can be re-produced andre-presented, so \thi{image} corresponds to a more \co{virtual} element whichsimply does not have any unique \co{representation}, it only has many different\co{actualisations}. Recalling Eiffel Tower you can draw it in various ways, youcan describe it with various words and pictures.  \citetib{<<The image must be  more like its object than any picture. [...] it is essential to the image that  it is the image of {\em this} and nothing else.>> Thus one might come to  regard the image as a super-likeness.}{WittPI}{I:389. Let us also point out  the close connection between \thi{image} and \thi{aspect}: \citefib{The    concept of an aspect is akin to the concept of an image. In other words: the    concept \thi{I am now seeing it as\ldots} is akin to \thi{I am now having      {\em this} image}.}{WittPI}{II:xi\kilde{181}} Different as these concepts  may be in Wittgenstein, both are closely related to our \nexus\ and  \co{aspect}.  Discerning, eventually, \thi{words of thought} as only a germ in  our mind, Wittgenstein concludes: \citefib{If God had looked into our minds he    would not have been able to see there whom we were speaking    of.}{WittPI}{II:xi\kilde{p.185}}\noo{Would be unable to \co{actually} see,    for the deeper contents are \co{invisible}.} What is there \thi{in our    minds} seems more like \co{virtual nexuses} than like any \co{visible,    precise} pictures.}  Suggesting that image is \co{virtuality} of a picture(of many pictures) we have stretched its meaning a bit further.\ftnt{Primarily,  in that Wittgenstein seems to see it only in the context of (sentences describing)  \co{actual} imagining, so that \citefib{[s]eeing an aspect and imagining are    subject to the will.}{WittPI}{II:xi\kilde{p.182}}  Even if it (always) were so, it still would not imply that also {\em forming}  the \thi{aspects} and \thi{images} is any voluntary activity.} For remembering EiffelTower is not so very different from understanding/knowing pain: we have some(yes, a bit mysterious) \thi{image} which can only be \co{actualised} in variouspictures.  To recognise pain of a burning moth or wriggling fly, you have to seethem as \co{actual} pictures of a \co{vague} image: pain; just like to recognisea particular drawing you have to see it as a possible \co{actualisation} of theimage of Eiffel Tower, and like to use the theorem in the \co{actual} situationyou have to find the \thi{way it applies}, you have to subsume the \co{actual}situation under the generality of the theorem.\noo{All three cases are, of  course, distinct and other aspects of each could be brought forth to  illustrate it. We are concerned only with this aspect which they share.} Evenif the last case is simply a subsumption of a particular instance under ageneral rule, it can be seen as related to the other cases where a particularpicture illustrates, or \co{actualises} an image.\ftnt{The {\em relation} of  instantiation is no less mysterious than that of exemplification or  \co{actualisation}. \citef{This schematism [...] is an art concealed in the    depths of the human soul, whose real modes of activity nature is hardly    likely ever to allow us discover.}{CrPR}{The schematism of the Pure Concepts    of Understanding;A141/B181}} This image is no longer any \co{actual  representation} but a more \co{vague} \nexus\ which no longer has a\co{dissociated} existence of merely \co{actual object}, but is rooted in thedeeper layers of \co{virtuality}. The difficulty with remembering is toreproduce an \co{actual} picture from this \co{virtual} \nexus, is to recallanew various aspects of the understood theorem.  \citetib{The difficulty is not  that I doubt whether I really imagined [Eiffel Tower, pain or] anything red.  But it is {\em this}: that we should be able, just like that, to point out or  describe the colour that we have imagined, that the projection of the image  into reality presents no difficulty at all.}{WittPI}{I:386}%Objective sign - remembered -> permamnence/objectivity/long time-span\pa Understanding amounts to integration of particular elements into appropriatecontexts; integration, that is, ability to fetch them in appropriate situationsfor particular purposes. Likewise, memory includes (images of the) rememberedthings into deeper, more \co{virtual} layers of our being, from which they canbe fetched as \co{actual} pictures. The image-like character of a rememberedthing reflects the degree of its involvement into the \co{nexus} of otherelements, that is, the degree of its dissolution in the more \co{virtual nexus}.An effect of this involvement, of an element becoming an integral part of thewhole, is, rather naturally, that the element's identity becomes lessrecognisable -- no longer a \co{precise} picture, \co{actual} statement, but a\co{vague} image.\ftnt{We can recall the increasing \thi{density} of the images  close to the pole, as the projected points of the line lie further and further  away from the circle -- I:\ref{sub:virt}.\refp{pa:stages}.}%Consequently, memory is not a mere recording machine which can, possibly,influence the present (the view which Piaget attributes to Freud and Bergson).It involves a successive and constant re-organisation by a process of\citet{active and selective structuring.}{PiagetMem}{p.378.\noo{    \citaft{PiagetPhil}{ p.83}} By the way, this fundamental point is  consistently ignored by all pedagogy which, assuming artificial  \co{dissociation} of memory and thinking, tries in a single-minded fashion to  motivate every single step of its procedure and to develop \thi{understanding}  before, or even instead of \thi{memory}, by releasing pupils from the boring  memorization drill.

The arrows $\rightleftharpoons$ at each stage represent theinteraction and mutual influence of the involved elements.  This may be a morerealistic picture of the workings of memory, confirmed also by variousexperiments of Piaget's.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{Casey}. This picture is to some  extent consistent with the memory built as a retentional continuum in which  the current retention of the previous phase retains also the retention of this  previous phase, which itself contains retention of its predecessor, and so on.  The crucial difference (besides the fact that we are not concerned exclusively  with consciousness) is that here it is not a mere accumulation of the past  phases, but that each stage may influence both its successor {\em and} its  predecessor.  Also this observation goes back at least to the phenomenologists  around Husserl. Scheler, for instance, remarks: \citef{[E]very experience of    our past remains unready with respect to value and undetermined with respect    to meaning, as long as not all of its inherent effectualities have been    released. Only in the totality of the whole life, when we have died, the    experience will become an unchangeable fact with ready meaning, like the    past natural events are from the very start.}{MaxReue}{ p.34}\orig{... so    ist auch jedes Erlebnis unserer Vergangenheit noch wert{\em unfertig} und    sinn{\em unbestimmt}, solange es nicht {\em alle} seine ihm m\"{o}glishen    Wirksamkeiten geleistet hat.

They get surrounded by other eventsand experiences, conscious or not, remembered or not, and gradually lose theiridentity retreating further and further, and merging into the sphere of\co{virtuality}.  \citet{As the time-object withdraws into the past, it shrinks  and therewith becomes dim.}{Zeit}{ A:1.2.{\para{9}.}\orig{Indem das zeitliche    Objekt in die Verrgangenheit r\"{u}ckt, zieht es sich zusammen und wird    dabei zugleich dunkel.}}  At the present moment, $M_{r}$ is confronted withthe whole past which, indeed, is not given as a collection of bits and piecesglued together, but as a \co{virtual} unity of \ldots the past.  It involvesthings we remember, and can \co{actualise}, as well as those we do not, andwhich we can not.  Some might have been lost forever for \co{actual}recollection, yet they remain present, albeit transformed beyond possiblerecognition, dissolved and de-identified.  The picture is not exactly like theone above but rather something like:\[  (\ldots\Big(\bigg( \Bigg(\bullet      \rightleftharpoons      \begin{array}{c}{\scriptscriptstyle{\vdots}}\\[-.5ex]                     {\scriptscriptstyle{M_{1}}}\\ [-.5ex]                     {\scriptscriptstyle{{\vdots}}}\end{array}      \Bigg)      \rightleftharpoons      \begin{array}{c}{\scriptstyle{M_{2}'}}\\[-.5ex]                     {\scriptstyle{M_{2}}}\\ [-.5ex]                     {\scriptstyle{{M_{2}''}}}\end{array}      \displaystyle\bigg)     \rightleftharpoons M_{3}\Big) \rightleftharpoons \ldots )     \rightleftharpoons M_{r}\]Well known examples -- of integration of the \co{actual} facts andobservations into the totality of our \co{experience} -- concern learning almost anything, in particular, some skills like riding abicycle. The scattered pieces of advice from the instructor, the failed attemptsto master one particular movement at a time, the intense consciousness tryingto organise all the bits in proper sequences and alliances of movements -- all that continues until one \thi{gets it}. And although we tend to focus onthe exact moment when we \thi{get it} for the first time, it is not the moment whichis important but the fact that all the labourious details, all the minutesuccesses and failures recede into the background of almost unconsciousautomatism. The emerging consistency of the totality is a qualitative change inrelation to the tiny details which led to this emergence. The moment of\thi{getting it} represents the formation of a new \co{virtual unit}, which\thi{falls in place}, gets integrated with the \co{totality} of other elements.The examples are not, of course, limited to acquiring motoric skills-- learning to solve differential equations has exactly the same structure ofpainful details receding gradually into the background of the acquiredskill.In case it were said that here one is still able to voluntarily \co{actualise} theacquired skill, and so it does not really illustrate the transition into\co{virtuality}, let us consider some other examples. As we described in the opening sections of Book I, the lack of memories from theearliest days and hours of our existence is not due to the lack of memory but ofanything specific to remember.  In the beginning we do not collect memories ofany \co{actual} things or events, but only some \co{virtual} \co{traces} which only laterget differentiated into more \co{precise} forms. These primal \co{traces}, too, maybe called \wo{memories}, albeit only in our generous sense of the word.A still more illustrative example may be that of imperfect memories, memorieswhich lost not only some of the original details but {\em all} of them.  Proustdescribes also the extreme cases when the \co{actual} element triggers thesearch for its past counterpart which, however, fails; e.g.: \citet{[...] I  sensed the smell of the cherries on the table and nothing else. [...] I could  not, however, choose anything from the confused, known and forgotten  impressions; eventually, after a short while, I ceased seeing anything and my  memory for ever immersed itself in sleep.}{ProustSB}{Introduction\noo{p.120}}One might say: the smell triggers a recollection which either became completelyunrecognisable, or at least is so in the current moment; (an event of) memorywithout anything remembered.\ftnt{A similar and common case: \wo{I know this    person, I am sure I know him but \ldots who is he? Where did I meet him?}  \co{Recognition} of the remembered \thi{image} precedes here the \co{actual},   conscious remembering. The person emerges from the surrounding (\co{virtual}  background) already marked with the sign of his identity (the image is like a  super-likeness of its object) -- even though consciousness still needs to  decipher the tokens of this identity, to fetch the detailed pictures.}  In many situations, what remains are not any specific details but only\co{vague} feelings of the atmosphere, of the character of the situation, of thegeneral impression which was \co{actual} then or, perhaps, which is so only nowand in some way gets referred, \thi{connected} to the original experience.Particular things may, as with Proust, play a role but only auxiliary one, of atrigger. Memories, according to Proust, do not {\em live} in things, they areonly imprisoned there. Memories, \citetib{every hour of our life, once it has  passed into the past, incarnates into some material object and remains hidden  there, imprisoned until we meet it on our way.}{ProustSB}{\noo{Introduction}} This\thi{imprisonment} should be taken as a mere metaphor of the potential totrigger a recollection: the \co{actual} things are needed only to {\em awake}the memories from their sleep, that is, to awake the mind from its sleep in mere\co{actuality} devoid the enlivening presence of memories.  Particular things,and their remembrance, are only expressions of the true life of memories;\citeti{voluntary memory, the memory of intelligence and eyes reproduces the  past only as an imperfect picture, which resembles the original as much as the  pictures of bad painters resemble spring.}{M. Proust in a letter to  Ren\'{e} Blum.}{} \citet{Compared to this past which is an intimate part of  ourselves, the truths of intelligence seem little  real.}{ProustSB}{Introduction\noo{p.121}} Such \thi{emotional memory}, which is an intimate part of ourselves, is morefrequent than we commonly admit. For in \co{actual} terms what counts is the\thi{voluntary memory}, are the \co{precise} details which we are able torecount and recollect in the \co{actual} context, not any \thi{subjective}  feelings.  Yet, much of the childhood memories consist often of exactlysuch \co{moods} and \co{impressions}.  Reading a book for the second time after10 years, only some details will re-emerge from memory as you encounter themagain.  Many of them you simply do not remember.  Yet, you will quicklyre-cognise the general impression the book made on you, you will recognise theimage by means of a few pictures.  Only some accidental\co{actual} element is needed: to hear the sound of a dropped tea-spoon torecall Combray and the childhood home, to stumble over the uneven pavement infront of the palace of the Guermantes to recall the walk in Venice.% \citt{sound of \ldots}{Proust -- cookie dipped in tea reminds about Odette,%   vol.I (W strone Swanna), part 1 (Combray)}, for the original text, the whole% Combray coming back --The recollections need not come back in all details but only with the detailssufficient to establish the connection between the two points in time.  Beyondthat, what is recollected are the significant \co{signs} (pictures) of the more\co{virtual} elements, of the atmosphere and mood without which the memorieswould remain \co{dissociated} and lifeless chips.%\sep\pa \thi{Voluntary memory}, the memory of intelligence and \co{reflection}, isonly one layer of memory, just like the \co{objective, dissociated} \thi{givens}constitute only the lowest layer of any actual situation. These lowest layers oftheir respective threads, \thi{voluntary memory} and \co{objects}, mark both the same level, are both \co{aspects} of the same \nexus\ of\co{reflection} and \co{objectivity}.\citet{A dog believes his master is at the door. But can he also believe his  master will come the day after tomorrow? -- And {\em what} can he not do here?  -- How do I do it? -- How am I supposed to answer this?\lin Can only those  hope who can talk? Only those who have mastered the use of a language. That is  to say, the phenomena of hope are modes of this complicated form of  life.}{WittPI}{II:i} Recall two kinds of time (consciousness) fromI:\ref{sub:objectiveTime}.\refpf{pa:twoTimesA}: the phenomenal time of\co{actual now}, with all its retentions and protentions vs. the objective timeof \thi{inauthentic consciousness of time, of remote past}. Expecting somebody'sarrival the day after tomorrow (or next year) presupposes consciousness ofobjective time, simply because having at all the idea of \thi{next year}requires such consciousness. We could say: if dog does not expect his master toarrive next week, this happens for the same reasons for which he does notconsider how the ball he is playing with feels in the hand of his master nor,for that matter, where {\em this} very ball was made.\ftnt{Promising is likewise  a good example of this crossing point, of \co{actuality} lying at the point  where the \co{foundation} in the deeper \co{unity} across time meets the  \thi{frozen} objectivity. It is will, patience and perseverance  which are capable of stretching the influences of \co{actuality} to remote  future, and all these presuppose objective time. Opposing the autonomous man  with independent will to the mere moralistic follower of custom, Nietzsche  points out how the \co{unity} in the objective time is internalised and  existentially grounded in the former and only \co{externally} accepted by the  latter: \citef{the sovereign individual who resembles nothing except himself    and who again is freed from the morality of custom [... is] the man    possessed of a personal, independent, and long-lasting will and who is {\em      competent to make promises.}}{GM}{II:3} The {\em competence} to make  promises, unlike the mere customary ability to make them, is an expression of  the lived \co{unity}, of the lived understanding that I am one person,  immersed in but also independent from the flow of objective time. Evading  promises one had made amounts to estranging oneself from one's past which,  eventually, means \co{alienating} oneself from oneself.} We do not imagine dogsto relate to the possible difference between {\em this} very ball and anotherthough indistinguishable one, that is, to have consciousness of objectivity. Buta dog can await and expect its master's arrival, and long for him the more, thelonger is his absence. For dogs, too, live in the temporality with its past andfuture. They live in the same time as we do and are \co{aware} of the same time-- only this \co{awareness} does not reach the crispness of \co{objective  dissociations}.\co{Reflective signs as signs}, constituting the \co{foundation} of language,enter likewise into the \nexus\ of \co{objectivity}. Serving as important toolsof \thi{freezing} some (limits of) \co{distinctions} (I:\ref{sub:actnonPower}),they serve likewise as tools of \thi{voluntary memory} or, as we also could say,\co{objective} memory. We may have vivid \thi{emotional} recollections of someparticularly significant events from our remote past. But for the most, whathappened to us five years ago is not remembered \thi{in flesh} but merely asabstract descriptions. I can say: \wo{Five years ago I was in Prague, I walked  past \ger{Malostransk\'{e} n\'{a}m\u{e}sti} almost every day, I ate dinner  several times at this place,} etc., but all these events are recalled as merefacts, as merely \co{objective} facts which would feel and could be describedalmost exactly the same way if I were relating events from a movie or sketchingan imaginary story I planned to write. Of course, I am relating my own past andit is still some \co{virtual} image which underlies these recollectingdescriptions. So, in principle, one might manage that also without objectivetime? But the role of objective time, and words, is quite crucial. Objectivetime allows us to refer to such a remote event which has been \thi{emotionally}forgotten, just like single \co{objects} or situations trigger, according toProust, vivid \thi{emotional} memories. One asks: \wo{What did you do in the  summer for five years ago?}  Without objective time such a question would notmake any sense.\noo{and without words it could not be asked.} Events in our lifedo not carry any inherent time stamp on them. One can remember meeting somebodyand have no idea if it was two, three or five years ago. One can remember twodistinct events and be unable to say which happened before which.\co{Experiences} become mutually related and organised along the line of\co{objective} time. Without it they would only interlock in a \co{virtual}mesh, losing their identities and hence disappearing for future recollections.Even if we could, in some unclear and unspecified sense, remember our whole lifewhile living at some pre-\co{reflective} and pre-\co{objective} level, we wouldhave no means to fetch these \thi{memories} and \co{actualise} them. And what isa memory which can not be recalled? The events would simply keep dissolving inthe \co{virtuality} of our past, forming us, as experiences form also thecharacter of a dog. But the whole process would remain un\co{reflected} andhidden in the same \co{virtuality} which \co{founds} it.\pa Just like \co{actuality} of \co{reflection} is \co{founded} in the hierarchyof higher \co{aspects}, so also the \co{reflective} memory%, recalling something to reappearhas its deeper presuppositions.  The first is that it is needed at all. And itis because life and world are not a whole given in the unity of one \co{act} butare split into diversity of separate \co{actualities}. The need for\thi{voluntary} memory, just like for ideal entities, arises with the\co{dissociating} activity of \co{reflection} and is the more intense the more\co{precisely dissociated} become the contents of our attention. (It is notunusual that extraordinary intelligence is accompanied by the excellent memory,even if this excellence is often limited exclusively to the memory of the thingsoccupying the intelligence.) The second presupposition is that it is what actually takes place, that I \co{actually}remember {\em the same}.  This \thi{repetition as recurrence} requires thepossibility of \co{re-cognising} identity of the same across time. As wesuggested discussing time in I:\refpf{pa:objectiveTime}, and as we willelaborate below, this is possible because new things and \co{experiences} arenot \thi{added} to any given collection but, like everything else, emerge asresults of differentiation from the \co{indistinct origin}. More specifically,such \thi{repetitions} express the \co{recognitions} which are not necessarilylimited to pure \hoa. They arise from \co{virtual} \nexuss\ whose \co{unity}precedes \co{dissociation} of \co{actualities}. Memory, as \co{reflective  re-cognition}, is \co{an experience} of a \co{recognition} transcending the\hoa.And thus we arrive at the most fundamental, even if entirely trivial,assumption: memory can take place only in a being whose unity stretches acrosstime, whose unity is not an \co{immediate} self-identity limited to pure\co{immediacy} but \co{transcends} its horizon.  \citet{All beings confessedly  continue the same, during the whole time of their existence. [...]  All these  successive actions, enjoyments, and sufferings, are actions, enjoyments and  sufferings, of the same living being. And they are so, prior to all  consideration of its remembering and forgetting [...]}{Butler}{Appendix I}Memory does not establish identity nor is it constitutive for personal identity-- at most, it can help establishing the sense, the feeling of it. Losingmemory, one does not necessarily lose \co{oneself}, and even without rememberinganything of one's past one can still know {\em that} one had a past. %It is not, for this reason, a mere ontic accident or anepistemological device.  It is one of the fundamental aspects disclosing in  \co{actual experiences} the \co{foundation} of this \co{actuality}in the continuity through time and, in the last instance, in the \co{unity} of\co{existence}. \subsubnonr{Language}\pa\label{pa:language} Language provides the common means for drawing boundariesbetween things, whose usefulness and practicality is not based exclusively ontheir \co{precision} but often, on the contrary, on their roughness. If I cutoff the branches, what is left is a \thi{trunk} and no longer a \thi{tree}; if Icut the whole \thi{trunk}, what is left is only a \thi{stump}.  But, of course,we have no \co{precise} idea how low the stump must be to be a \thi{stump} andnot a \thi{trunk}, nor how many branches must be cut off for a \thi{tree} tobecome a \thi{trunk}.  Growing up into a language which has only one word for,say, both \wo{pain} and \wo{suffering}, one would tend to consider the two asidentical and, in any case, \co{reflective} establishment of the distinctionwould probably take much longer time and might even appear as a deep discovery.If eighteen or so Hebrew words for different shades of \thi{purity} gettranslated by the same Greek word \wo{\gre{katharos}}, then the meaning of theOld Testament must undergo some, hopefully only slight, changes.%almost necessarily acquire a slightly different form.But claiming that without the linguistic means, one is entirely incapable of\co{experiencing} the difference, would be like claiming that the lack of namesfor many colours and their shades makes also experiencing the actual differencesimpossible. The identities and distinctions sedimented in the language expressonly roughly the average relevance, as well as the historical development --they are passed as pragmatic guidelines, but they {\em never determine} therange of the possible \co{experiences} of identity and difference.\noo{They  affect primarily the mediocre, though they certainly may -- may!  -- influence  the exceptional, too.}  The relativity of identities (and possibly also ofelaborate systems thereof) can be discerned by observing some differencesbetween languages.\pa Slavic languages provide almost unlimited means for modifying the nouns bymeans of suffixes -- not only to form chains of diminutives, but also toindicate features and impressions the things make on one, as if stretching andcomprising the stem, which in many other languages would require unbearable series ofadjectives.\ftnt{In Polish, for instance, \wo{ptak} is a bird, \wo{ptaszek} a  small bird, \wo{ptaszyna}   an even smaller one, \wo{ptasior} is a rather large and ugly, possibly  dangerous bird, \wo{ptaszydlo} is an extremely repulsive \wo{ptasior}, etc.} Infact, most nouns can be turned, or dissolved, by such means into adjectives. Theontology, the collection of identities, seems to dissolve in a landscape ofgrades, variations and qualities without any definite and final\thi{substances}.  In Germanic languages one utilises much more the oppositeoperation to that just mentioned of forming adjectives from nouns, namely, onewhich results in a noun formed from an adjective (the suffix -ness in English,-heit in German).  A language like German, where the etymological connectionsbetween words are still very tight, but variations less flexible, where theformation of compound words (in particular, nouns, practically absent in Slaviclanguages) seems to reflect the structure of entities, will suggest ontology ofhierarchies and systematic relations between basic entities, and by the sametoken, emphasize the division between the natural and rational, the given andthe constructed element.  A language like English, an enormous collection ofwords from multilingual sources, which provide great flexibility, but even whenexpressing very close and related phenomena, remain etymologically unrelated,will suggest ontology of minute, mutually independent elements. Theidentities, as well as the character of the identity itself, are instinctivelyestablished by means of the dissociated atoms, unrelated words.As a more specific example let us consider only the word for \thi{reality} and itsfolk-etymology. We are not asking for any genuine etymology. It is thesuperficial, pseudo-etymological or even merely phonetic associations ratherthan the scientific etymology which may -- may!  -- influence a child, longbefore it possibly might start studying linguistics.English \wo{reality} gives hardly any immediate associations.  Sure, one canthink of some Latin origins from \wo{res} but these are too advancedconsiderations for us. It is but another word, as unrelated to \wo{house} as to\wo{thing} or \wo{activity}.  The conceptual correlate, something likethe definition of \thi{reality} in a Merriam-Webster dictionary: \wo{something that is  neither derivative nor dependent but exists necessarily}, seems as empty andabstract as the lack of any deeper linguistic relatedness which it reflects.German \wo{Wirklichkeit} is an entirely different matter. It is bound to beassociated, unconsciously and often consciously, with \wo{Wirkung}, \wo{wirken},etc. \wo{Wirklichkeit} is something that acts, works, is efficacious, it is apower rather than a state.  \wo{The world of the real is a world in which this  acts on that, changes it and again experiences reactions itself and is changed  by them. [...] What value could there be for us in the eternally unchangeable  which could neither undergo effects nor have effects on us?  Something  entirely and in every respect inactive would be unreal and non-existent for  us.} Well~\ldots spoken by a true philosopher oflanguage.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{FregeTruth} {p.103/104.} Emphasizing relativity of  every \co{distinction} to the \co{distinguishing existence}, and claiming that  to be is to be \co{distinguished}, we come very close to the idea of the last  quoted sentence. Every \co{distinction} makes a difference. However, the  difference need not imply any activity and even less any effects of physical  kind, which are exactly the aspects captured by \wo{Wirklichkeit}. The same  associations obtain in the Scandinavian languages.}Polish \wo{rzeczywisto\'{s}\'{c}} brings immediately associations with\wo{rzeczy} -- \wo{things}.  The suffix \wo{-isto\'{s}\'{c}} has no inherentmeaning (it is used to form many other words), but it may easily lead a laymanto something like \wo{istno\'{s}\'{c}}/\wo{istnienie} -- \wo{being},\wo{existence}.  Thus, \thi{reality} seems to be the state or order of things(all things?), something given rather then acting, and acting only in the way\thi{being} acts -- by simply being.\ftnt{Russian   \wo{deystvitelnost}, although including the aspect of effective activity,  \wo{deystvenny}, gives similar associations to passive  happening, something which is because it happens but which is simply the way  it is.\label{ftnt:deyst}}% \citet{Etymology is a wonderful way of exploring the unconscious; it is the%   unconscious of language.}{PsycheAntiq}{I:5.~Parmenides and Anaxagoras}\pa We are not linguists and all this is, of course, very rough.

But in spite of all such differences (reflected also in theindeterminacy of translation), different human languages have approximately thesame differentiating and unifying power.  Sure, some words, expressing someparticular \co{distinctions}, may be emphasized in one language and missing inanother, and almost always more \co{vague distinctions} will be drawn acrossdifferent, though hardly disjoint, semantic fields.  But, in general, the\co{distinctions} expressed in one language can be reflected (even if sometimesonly clumsily) in another -- after all, and in spite of indeterminacy, atranslation is possible. Above all, one person can always, even if only inprinciple, communicate to another, all such linguistic differencesnotwithstanding.\ftnt{And so there is nothing which prevents, for instance, the  active, apparently Germanic \ger{Wirklichkeit}, to appear in the Latin of 50  \bc: \citef{whate'er exists, as of itself,\lin Must either act or suffer    action on it.}{Things}{I:4\kilde{p.16}}} So we will leave language to thelinguists and the fascination with its mystical (or, as one rather should saytoday, post-analytical) influences on the mind to those who have nothing betterto influence their minds, and start discussing identity.  We will steer awayfrom language for although it is a means of drawing and establishing\co{distinctions}, it is \co{founded} in the ability to \co{distinguish} whichis both prior to and much wider than the sphere of the \co{actual signs}, not tomention the mere words.% \say% But, language does not establish identity.

The doubling brings forththe self-identity which is just the expression of the fact that doubling did notchange the original phenomenon. The thing remains itself, it only gets doubledin the perspective of the \co{reflective representation}. \citet{<<A thing is  identical with itself.>> -- There is no finer example of a useless  proposition, which yet is connected with a certain play of imagination.

Everything,that is, which can be grasped in the \co{immediate} limit of a single \co{act}, andthat is close to nothing. But self-identity (to be completely distinguished fromany identity of the self), the empty formula $x=x$, becomes the paradigm, thegoverning norm of all further considerations of identity. The problems hauntingthese considerations, as aptly illustrated by Wittgenstein's analogy of\thi{fitting into its itself}, are the problems of determining the criteria ofidentity. These, in turn, reflect only metaphysical arbitrariness of what, amongall temporal objects, could count as the ultimate \thi{substances}.The problems with the criteria of identity are the problems of classifying several \co{actual} appearances as the same, so to speak, of fitting them into this\co{immediate} limit of self-identity where they would coincide with each other. \ad{\act Actual identity: $a=b$}\label{actId}%Same as transcendent!!!% - hence impossible to account for in lower level's categoriesThe original \co{repetition} is the \co{reflective} \thi{doubling} of the same.In most abstract terms, this is what also \thi{repetition as recurrence} is --the same thing seen from two, or more, different perspectives. But now, theseperspectives are perspectives in a more intuitive sense of the word, they are\thi{snapshots}, different \co{actualities}. Equality arises as a relation ofsameness across distinct \co{actualities}, where a point $a$ in (\co{actuality})$A$ turns out to be the same as $b$ in (\co{actuality}) $B$.  As Frege observed,the difference between $a=a$ and $a=b$ concerns the form of presentation. Justlike the statement $a=a$ does not say anything, the statement $a=b$ says quite alot -- their \ger{Erkenntniswert} is very different. The former states merelythe \co{immediate} self-identity, it \citet{is valid a priori and, following  Kant, is called analytic.}{FregeSinn}{\label{ftnt:aaab}} The latter, on theother hand, says that $a$ and $b$ are two different perspectives, two differentsnapshots of something.  This something, this ever transcendent $x$, arisesprecisely as the equality of $a$ (i.e., $x$ viewed as, or in the context of,$A$) and of $b$ (i.e., $x$ viewed as, or in the context of, $B$).\ftnt{Frege  says that $a$ and $b$ are simply different signs and that identity is an  epistemic relation between signs, which obtains when both have the same  denotation, \ger{Bedeutung}. This is probably what it becomes, eventually, in  the \co{actual world} with its ready-made \co{objects}. Our point here will  be, primarily, that this relation (or fact?) is \co{founded} and emerges as a  residual \co{trace} in the process which first \co{dissociates} various  \co{actualities}, and then must re-establish the connections between them. The  ambiguity can be discerned in the naming. \wo{Identity} seems to refer to the  absolute fact, while \wo{equality} to a relation between $a$ and $b$. We will  use both words at the present level.}Leaving and then returning to a room, I \co{re-cognise} the cup on thetable as the same which was there a while ago.  The cup \co{here-and-now}\ points to the one \co{there-and-then}.  True, it points in a very specific waymaking the identification of the two immediate, but it does point nevertheless.What does it mean? That it is \co{a sign as a sign}, a \co{sign} whosenon-identity with the signified is now given along with it? OK, but primarily,this \herenow, the \co{actuality} of this cup, has been \co{dissociated} fromthe \co{actuality} of that cup, the two have lost any connection.  Thisnon-identity is the difference of \co{dissociated actualities}, \herenow\ asopposed to \thth; it is posed by \co{reflection} which, havingscattered various \co{actualities} across the time, dwells exclusively among the\co{dissociated experiences}.On a closer look, that is, on some \co{self-reflection}, the very identity of Iwho am \co{reflecting} becomes only a mysterious quality for which\co{reflection} can not account in terms of \co{actuality}. How can I know,\co{actually} know and be sure, thatI \co{reflecting} in this very moment am the same as I a while ago? There is nological impossibility in assuming that the two are different and that everythingis re-created anew in every instant, with the amazing precision creating merelyan illusion that it is the same.It is obviously false or, if we do not like the word, it is not a fruitful oreven meaningful way of speaking (showing, by the way, the value of such acriterion as \thi{logical possibility}). At another level of \co{experience} Iobviously know, i.e., \co{experience} the cup \co{here-and-now} and the one\co{there-and-then} as the same thing, and I know myself to be the same persontoday as I was yesterday.  But where is the proof, where is the unshakeablecertainty of the two being the same?There is none.  For \co{reflection}, burdened with the \co{dissociation} ofall \co{actual experiences}, this identity is problematic, to say the least.Given two things separated into different \co{actualities}, their identity cannot arise in (yet another) \co{actuality} otherwise than as some mysterious $x$which binds them across and in spite of the gap in time.  Such an $x$ is never\co{actually} experienced.  Since Plato, one has been more than willing to say\wo{Alas!  An ideal entity.  The cup here and the one before are just instances  of the same.  And what is this \thi{the same}?\ldots  A universal.}\ftnt{One  would be cautious to distinguish a trivial repetition of the same (thing) from  instances of a universal but the meaning and the pattern are exactly the same.  As argued in \ref{impressConcept}, universals  are but special case of \co{non-actualities}; a single repetition, an  appearance of the same only twice, presents already all the problems of  indeterminately long series of repetitions, of ideal entities or universals.}An $x$, an ideal cup existing beyond the \hoa\ and binding together the cup\herenow\ with the cup \thth.  In order to account for theidentity across different \co{actualities} -- from the perspective of\co{actuality} -- \co{reflection} ends up with postulating ideal entities.Identity is a \co{trace} of that \co{dissociation}, and so is the noumenal $x$which keeps forever receding beyond any horizon of\co{distinctions}.\ftnt{At first, one may try saying things like that sameness  means identity, which expresses the epistemological optimism that if $a$ now  is the same as $b$ was then, so this sameness across the two  \co{actualities} witnesses to the identity of the appearing thing. But quickly the  natural consequence becomes relativisation of identity   to the operations of the mind. Identity is not a \thi{real} relation, existing  somehow \thi{in} the object, but arises only as a consequence of different  perspectives under which mind views the object.

It is that one assumesfrom the start that the true givenness, true presentation happens only withinthe \hoa.  Whatever exceeds this horizon becomes suspicious, prone to deceivingus, uncertain.  The paradigm of certainty is the \co{immediacy}, presence within\hoa\ -- this horizon, eventually the evanescent point of \co{immediacy}, isimplicitly taken as the only point of contact with reality.  Taking thus unitsof \co{reflective experiences} as the atoms of reality, one is, indeed, in dearneed to invent ideal entities to keep the scattered pieces of \co{actualities}together.  Ideal entities are \co{reflective} tools useful for organising\co{reflective experiences} -- but the problem of their (ontological or other)status is based on the implicit conviction that the real is only the\co{actual} and that everything else requires a justification in terms of\co{actuality} and preferably of \co{immediacy}.\noo{The origin of repetition, and hence of universals, is the \co{reflective  repetition}, and then \thi{repetition as recurrence} which is \co{founded} in,and thus witnesses to, the dimension of \co{experience} transcending the \hoa.}If we, instead of starting from \co{actual experiences}, start from the \co{unity} of\co{experience}, eventually of our being, which only subsequently getsdiversified and split into \co{actualities}, then repetition is only\co{an experience} of the same from different perspectives, from differentpoints of \co{actuality}. \co{Actual re-cognition} of $X$ as the same as another\co{actual} (but not actual now) $Y$ is a \co{recognition}, that is, \co{an  experience} of $XY$ which has manifested itself in two distinct\co{actualities}.  It is not one, \co{actual} I perceiving $X$ who somewhat hasto establish a relation to another I who perceived $Y$. The moment of perceiving$X$ is but an \co{actuality} emerging from the background of \co{experience}where $X$ is but the \co{actual} aspect of $XY$.  Its definite {separation} isonly the result of \co{reflective dissociation}.Does it mean that every $X$ which is \co{experienced} as (a repetition of)$Y$, is actually the same as $Y$? Can't I be mistaken in taking $X$ for $Y$?Well, no and yes.I can't be mistaken because any such \co{experience} of repetition has a reason,there is always something which -- in my \co{experience} -- founds the\co{re-cognition} of $X$ as the same as $Y$. It is a \co{cut} through\co{experience} which, \co{distinguishing} $XY$, precedes the dissociation of\co{actual} $X$ from the \co{actual} (though not now) $Y$. I may \co{actually}not know what it is, I may even, in principle, never be able to account at thelevel of \co{reflection} for this $XY$, and yet the very fact of repetitioncould not take place without such an $XY$. After all everythingoriginates from \co{one}. But from the objectivistic point of view, that is, assuming the primordiality of\co{actually dissociated experiences}, I can certainly be mistaken.  There may bethousands of reasons and further \co{distinctions} which, if taken intoaccount, could force me to consider $X$ and $Y$ as differententities. In the extreme forms of empiricism, the mere fact of appearing in two different \co{actualities} can be taken as the justification of genuinedifference. \pa At some point, the \co{distinctions} terminate and this is what founds theidentity of the \co{actual} thing.  If I take at first moment the personentering the room to be my friend Yngve, then this is the current limit of\co{distinctions}.  In the next moment I may realise that the two are, in fact,different, that it is not Yngve but Xavier, but to see this, I have to bring inmore \co{distinctions} -- I have to see his face more \co{precisely}, see someof his movements which are totally un-Yngve-like, etc.  Yet, even then, the\co{experience} of the same, the first impression which confused the two (thatis, which did not distinguish XavierYngve), remains valid, it has revealedsomething which it was actually possible not to \co{distinguish}.\ftnt{As usual,  we are not talking about the \co{attentively reflective} activity which starts  with the ready \co{dissociated objects} and inquires only into the relations  between or possible abstractions from them. Such an activity, in a pure form,  is itself an abstraction which never obtains without being involved in more  fundamental processes which we are describing. It is, by the way, a good  example of the \co{dissociative} result of \co{reflection}. In the moment I  realise that it was Xavier, Xavier becomes {\em the} \co{object} of  \co{reflection} and thus also {\em the} \co{objective} aspect of the prior  XavierYngve situation. It becomes opposed to the \co{subjective} impression of  this having {\em only seemed} to be Yngve. Although XavierYngve remains and  merely withdraws behind the curtain, it seems to disappear completely as it  gives place to the two \co{aspects} of \co{reflective dissociation}: the  \co{objective} fact of Xavier entering the room and the merely \co{subjective}  impression of him being Yngve.}%We thus arrive at the following claim: %\newpa\thesisnonr{Identity is the actual\noo{(ly given)} limit of \co{distinctions}. }\label{th:identity}It is the point beyond which no more \co{distinctions} are made, or rather, aboundary within which no more \co{distinctions} are made.\ftnt{Almost identical  formulation reads: \citef{For in general those things that do not admit of    division are called one in so far as they do not admit of    it;}{AristMeta}{V:6} But the following examples suggest a different, weaker  meaning: \wo{e.g., if two things are indistinguishable \la{qua} man, they are    one kind of man; if \la{qua} animal, one kind of animal; if \la{qua}    magnitude, one kind of magnitude.} Two things can hardly be  indistinguishable \la{qua} man, or \la{qua} animal, but distinguishable in  other respect. The contention that two men can be, say, equally good and hence  both be one kind of man, namely, a good man, has re-surfaced recently as  relative identity and we will return to it in  \refp{pa:idwithresp}.\label{ftnt:idwithresp}}At which moment does the Theseus' ship cease to be itself and becomes a  new ship? At none, because it has never been \thi{itself}, it has never beenany metaphysical (or ontological) \thi{substance} with intrinsic, self-identical\thi{essence}.  It was the limit of \co{distinctions} which it was purposeful toterminate at this point, at the point at which we said \wo{This is a ship}, orperhaps even \wo{This is {\em this} ship}.  Replacing the planks, we beginintroducing further \co{distinctions} which suspendthe validity of the previous final boundary of \co{distinguishing}.  Its supposed\thi{essence} was nothing but such a boundary.  But assuming that it is somethingpositive, something which constitutes thing's identical \thi{being in itself}, we cannot avoid being perplexed by this ingenious puzzle.\pa An \co{aspect} of the crystallization of \co{object}'s independentsubsistence and identity, that is, of objective time, is \co{an experience} of change, ofone and the same \co{object} having earlier been so-and-so, but now beingotherwise.  This might seem to contradict the claim that identity is but alimit of \co{distinctions} since change implies additional \co{distinctions}which should differentiate the object before and after the change.  It does not,however, contradict the claim but only shows the relative arbitrariness of whatcounts as identity. For all practical purposes a river is a river, one and thesame river. And it remains one also after the observation that \citeti{[o]n  those who enter the same rivers, ever different waters flow}{Heraclitus}{ DK  22B12} pushes the limit of \co{distinctions} beyond that used for the ordinarypurposes. In principle, every issue can be dissolved (one might be tempted to saytoday: deconstructed) into interminable series of aspects, views, perspectivesand possibilities, every situation can be discussed \la{ad infinitum} withoutever reaching any bottom, every object can be divided and gradually dissolvedinto finer and finer distinctions. But this is so only in principle, that is, inabstract terms of \co{actual dissociations}. In practice, that is, in the onlycontext of relevance, it is not quite so. %But it is so not because there are no real issues, situations or objects -- tThe fact that a house can be deconstructed does not prove its unreality; andeven if later generation will build different houses in very different ways fromours, does not prove that we are building wrong and unreal houses. Even if\co{actual} truths change over time, at each particular time they are given inquite a stable fashion, in fact, sufficiently stable for people of similarinterests and levels of intelligence to be constrained in their formulations inapproximately the same ways. Objects, issues and situations arise relatively to thosewho participate in them and, in particular, relatively to their ability (whichis not under voluntary control) to terminate the \co{distinctions} at somespecific points. But relativity means neither subjectivity nor lack of anyobjective counterpart.Identity is established as the limit of \co{distinctions}; as some\co{actual}, not absolute limit -- beyond these, more \co{distinctions} may bepossible and actually take place.  In most cases, these further\co{distinctions} will be considered mere \thi{accidents} of the identical\thi{substance}, but in the extreme cases they may lead to the puzzles like thatof Theseus' ship.  I cut a branch from a tree; then I cut another; then yetanother; when I am finished with all the branches, I begin to cut, piece bypiece, the trunk, from the top to the bottom.  I end up with a heap of wood, butat what point does the tree cease to exist?  This is arbitrary, that is,dependent on the \co{distinctions} dictated by the circumstances.  If I left apart of the trunk standing, even if dead, one might say that {\em this} is thesame tree which stood here yesterday -- only dead and without branches.  Andsince what is relevant here might be the fact of something standing at thisparticular place, we do not focus on the change which occurred, the\co{distinction} that the trunk does not have all the branches the tree had, isignored.  If, however, the tree was the favorite one on which children used toclimb and play, then {\em this} tree has actually {\em ceased to exist} -- it isno more, and what is left is not the same.Does it mean that, to begin with, there were two trees and one survived cuttingoff the branches while the other did not. Certainly, there were different treesfor people who considered it only as something standing there and for the kidsclimbing it. But this question of Chrysippus concerns the \thi{objective} stateof affairs: are there, \thi{out there}, two trees or not? And if there are twowhich one survives?  Since we do not subscribe to any \thi{objective substances}existing \thi{out there} no matter what or who is around, we should be allowedto claim that it still depends on who is looking at the matter.  If somebodymust reach some absolute compromise, let him say that there is a sense in whichthere is only one tree which survived the process, namely, the tree identifiedas the limit of \co{distinctions} remaining at the end. He should not, however,try to convince the kids about it. Another problem with it is that one canremove something more from this rest and ask the question again.  One won't findany \thi{essence} but will end up postulating a residual point of self-identity.In our view, it is not only uninteresting but directly inadmissible.  Any answerto the question about Theseus' ship -- {\em at what point} does it cease to bethe old and becomes a new? -- has an aura of arbitrariness which has alwaysthreatened \thi{substantialism}. For it represents an antinomy arising from theinsistence on the yes-no answer to a question which does not have one, anantinomy of applying the \co{immediate} category of self-identity at the levelof \co{actuality}, of attempting to view a temporal object \thi{as if} it weretimeless, \co{precisely} delineated \thi{being in itself}, self-identical\thi{substance}.Before refining this issue and the thesis from~\refp{th:identity}, let uscomment on its relation to some alternatives which might seem possible.\subsubnonr{Indiscernibility and relativity}\wtsep{id of indisc}\pa \label{ft:identidiscern} Identity of a thing is always only relative to thedrawn \co{distinctions} -- consciously or not, intentionally or not,\co{actually} or not\ldots It is thus relative to the involved \co{existences}.Does this mean, as also the claim in \refp{th:identity} might suggest, that weare simply stating identity of indiscernibles? Not exactly, but the differencemay be rather subtle.First, the principle itself is an ingenious and more \co{precise} variant of thedictum: \citt{plurality must not be posited without necessity.}{E.g.  \citeauthor*{OckQuod}{ V:q.1;p.97}, \btit{Ordinatio sive Scriptum in librum    primum Sententiarum} I:Prologue 1.3 \citaft{FilSr}{ p.242} Earlier variantsof the razor figure, for instance, in \citeauthor*{Parmenides}{};  \citeauthor*{AristPhysics}{ I:187b.10}; \citeauthor*{ScotPrimo}{}} Itsobjective is to attune our understanding of identities to their metaphysicalrealm, to bring epistemological distinctions into agreement with the ontological\thi{facts}.  Viewed (perhaps with some degree of bad will) as such a project,the principle is quite different from our view according to which identity isnot recovered but constituted as the limit of \co{distinctions}.  Identity isnot any metaphysical, supra-human quality of things.  It is a purely pragmatic(albeit not voluntary) notion of fixing the limits of \co{distinctions} atrelevant points.  What makes it relevant is not given by any laws, but by thecontext.  Identity of indiscernibles is indeed a good rough expression -- do not\co{distinguish} what need not be \co{distinguished}.  But since we do not haveany \thi{substances}, any \thi{essential} nor \thi{accidental} properties, aprocess which has been thus terminated at some point, at some identity, canalways, at least in principle, be carried further, for it never reaches any\thi{metaphysical identity}.\ftnt{These remarks do not apply to \co{existence}  which, being a limit of \co{distinguishability}, is also the site of ultimate  \co{unity}.}  Returning home every day I do not wonder if the sofa standingthere now is {\em really the same} as the one from yesterday, and if I do Ishould visit some specialist. It is the same because there is not the slightestreason, in fact, not any possibility to distinguish the two. It is only theassumption of some \thi{substances in themselves} which could make one wonderhow to prove that nobody in the meantime entered my flat and exchanged my sofafor another but \thi{identical} one.\ftnt{The two are indiscernible not only  because I can not discern any difference although I might suspect some to be  there. Sitting there and thinking: \thi{The two are identical, I cannot    possibly discern them {\em but} they still might be distinct!} -- such a  suspicion is already a discrimination. Hopefully, it may be later refuted  (with the help of a specialist?) and I can again start seeing the \thi{two} as  one and the same. But the very suspicion is already a \co{distinction}  \co{dissociating} the \co{actuality} of the sofa today from its \co{actuality}  yesterday.}\pa\label{pa:distLang} A more extreme exposition might be read into theprinciple which also might seem to make it identical to the above claim from\refp{th:identity}.  Its variant often plays a crucial role when one tries toattune knowledge to \thi{facts} by actually {\em getting rid of} alltranscendence and pretending that one is in the possession of a complete logicallanguage, fitting perfectly the external world.  It underlies equally theattempts to reduce all truth to mere language (``Whatever we cannot speak about,we should keep silent about''), or even all reality (``Reality is the names wegive to it'').\ftnt{Plausibility of such statements depends almost solely on the  intended meaning of \wo{we}, and then of \wo{I}.  Recall the ambiguities of  objectivity-subjectivity from section \ref{sub:objsubj}, in particular,  \refp{civObjSubj}.} Most abstractly, it amounts to reducing identity to the\co{actually} discernible criteria of identity.% This may seem to come closer to our view but, as a matter of fact, is even more% remote from it.The problem with this, like with most other principles, is to determine the waysand limits of its application. The crucial question concerns what is allowed asgrounds for discernibility.  What counts as the properties to be considered when decidingindiscernibility?  One will use \co{actual} observations but, of course, notexactly, because no two observations, made at different points of time, areexactly the same.  If we include even time, then we are left with pure\co{immediacies}, as \co{dissociated} from each other as the monads themselves.If we allow difference in time, then the question arises: how do wedetermine that the two appearances have the same -- that is, identical -- valueof all the relevant properties?  In particular, among all properties there isthe property of \thi{being equal to $a$} and so such a definition iscircular.\ftnt{Recently, \citeauthor*{Impred},\kilde{p.8} argued that such a  definition is only impredicative and not viciously circular, but we leave it  to the concept analysts to decide if such fine distinctions do us any  service.} So Leibniz wanted to limit the principle to \thi{substances} andcomparisons to the values of their properties, others started to distinguishintrinsic and extrinsic, pure and impure properties, the linguistic bias wouldlike to include everything -- and only! -- that can be expressed in (aparticular) language, etc., etc.In a sense, but only in a sense, our philosophy of \co{distinctions} and\co{distinguishing} goes along with the principle: whatever is not\co{distinguished}, remains \co{one} and the same.  The difference lies in thatwe take \co{distinction} as the primitive notion. It comprises much more thanany \co{actual} differences, whether of linguistic, mental, physical or whatevercharacter.  \co{Distinctions} need not have any mental character: most\co{distinctions}, even though relative to \co{me}, or rather to a form of\co{existence}, are not made by \co{me} (nor you), they are just encountered andtheir limits are \co{actual objects}.\noo{Thus, we can claim complete realism withrespect to the language, mind, or similar ideal entities -- their ideality doesnot create any \co{actual} identities.} The relative, yet \co{transcendent}character of many \co{distinctions} sets us apart from any understanding of theprinciple which usually appeals to empiricism by reducing the discernibility tothe \co{actually} observable \co{distinctions}.Moreover, there is no designated set of \co{distinctions} which, necessarily andsufficiently, determine identity. In one context color, material, origin\ldotsmay count, in another none of those may be relevant.  Two identical, butnumerically distinct, ships can be legitimately considered the same by a captainwho needs only one for the travel and views both equally fit for it.  (For him,the situation is entirely the same as it would be with only one ship available.)Claiming, on the other hand, that every possible distinction is relevant makesthe two immediately distinct. Our point concerning the relativity is that thereis no metaphysical set of criteria which could be used in every context fordetermining identity or discernibility.  There is no meta-level for the\co{distinctions} which could provide such criteria -- there are only sub-levelsof more and more specific classes of \co{distinctions}.  Eventually, \co{actual}things are but limits of \co{distinctions}. As there is no meta-level for thedetermination of such limits, this actually suggests the fundamental andprimitive, that is preceding any criteria, character of identity.There are two aspects of identity which tend to determine two opposite camps(perhaps, of Fregeans and Quineans, respectively): either identity is aprimitive notion, irreducible to others, or else it is in fact reducible to somecriteria. The latter comes in many variations, namely, variations over identityof indiscernibles. We agree with it in so far as identity is a limit of\co{distinctions}. In this sense, it is relative not only to a distinguishing\co{existence} but also to the distinctions taken into account. A thing is,after all, just the other side of the totality of all it excludes, it is, so tospeak, the \thi{complement of its outside}, \ref{sub:substances}. However, theborder between the \thi{inside} and \thi{outside}, the mere {\em fact} of itbeing drawn at all, is not determined by any universal criteria. It is a {\em  limit} of \co{distinctions} and as such a primitive event (usually, not an\co{act}), for drawing a limit is not reducible to merely drawing the\co{distinctions}. In this sense, identity is not merely a conceptual device forsimplifying thought, as Avenarius or Mach would have it. It is an \la{a priori}condition of thought, a reflection of the limitedness of \co{actuality}, whichcan not be reduced not only to any \co{actual} criteria, but not even to anyother notions. It is not an accident of \co{reflective} thought but its verypresupposition, an inseparable accomplice of \co{actual distinctions}.\noo{ \pa I \co{re-cognise} this cup on the table as the same I left there just  a moment ago.  Why?  There are no relevant \co{distinctions} to be made  between the two. I may indeed wonder if the two are \thi{really} the same, but  if want to wonder about that, I will never stop wondering -- the world does  not consist of \thi{substances} but of \co{distinctions} and their limits. Say  that there is a tree on the corner just outside my house.  One day, when I  wake up, I see the same tree, only that it is 2 meters to the left where the  tree was yesterday.  Is it the same or not?  What difference does it make?  I  would say none, and so it is the same tree -- the change which occurred is,  neither \thi{essential} nor \thi{accidental}, but simply irrelevant.  Of  course, here is more, since we would say that it is the same tree, even if it  were removed, put on a truck and driven out of town.  Here we could  \co{distinguish} the two, but we do not.  Well, a tree is an \co{object} which  so nicely fits into the \hoa, that we like to fix its identity.  To determine  that the two are really one and the same tree, we would try to establish an  unbroken continuity through time, but we do not have need (nor time) to do  such exercises, and it is much more practical just to fix the  \co{distinctions} at some point and not to \co{distinguish} things which need  not be \co{distinguished}. }\wtsep{relative id}\paWhat certainly does not apply is the opposite principle -- indiscernibilityof identicals. Two different trees, the one with all branches and the one (thesame!)  with two branches cut off {\em may} be considered the same, and so {\em  may} be Theseus' ship before and after renovation.  {\em We} fix identity atsome point and having fixed it, grave reasons may be needed to change it.  Inmost common cases, this fixation is merely a result of unconscious process, evenof bodily functions, of perception, sensation or, as it may be, ofpre-\co{reflective} \co{distinctions}, perhaps, drawn in the early stages of\co{experience}.\noo{ Identity is not any fundamental, metaphysical principle but, on the  contrary, a thoroughly pragmatic one -- not in the sense that it is what I,  you or we want it to be; not in the sense that its possible purposefulness may  override any kind of already given facts and reasons; but only in the sense  that its fixation is entirely relative to our, or other beings',  \co{experience}.  Consequently, having only a relative and pragmatic goal, the  principle of identity of indiscernibles is not any absolute, universal  principle, either.    Summarising: the principle is not any epistemological tool which can be  \co{actually} used in all cases, simply because the \co{distinctions} which  may be relevant need not be of \co{actually} observable character. On the  other hand, the observable differences may be irrelevant because the actually  established identity chooses to ignore them.  }\label{pa:idwithresp} There is a yet more specific variant of the principlewhich also tries to negate indiscernibility of identicals, or rather, limit thescope of its legitimacy. One says sometimes that identity is not an absolute notion, but something whichis relative -- $X$ and $Y$ may be identical only \thi{with respect to} some$Z$.\ftnt{Recalling first footnote~\ref{ftnt:idwithresp}, here we can observe  that already Hobbes presents this as a solution to the problems of   identity.  \citef{But we must first consider by what name anything is called,    when we inquire concerning the {\em identity} of it. For it is one thing to    ask concerning Socrates, whether he be the same man, and another to ask    whether he be the same body; for his body, when he is old, cannot be the    same it was when he was an infant, by reason of difference in magnitude; yet    nevertheless he may be the same man.}{HobbesCor}{II:11.7.} Notice, that  \wo{name} here denotes only the aspect \thi{with respect to} which identity is  established -- it is not the \co{sign} which merely \co{represents} the  identity.This may have different emphasis but reminds also of the \thi{indifferent-realism} atwhich William of Champeaux arrived under the critique from Abelard. Peter andPaul are said to be \thi{indifferently} men or possess humanity \la{secundum  indifferentiam} in that they are equally rational, mortal, etc. But they arestill two distinct men. The question how they can be two different men if,\la{qua} men, they are (indifferently) the same was hard enough to drive masterWilliam out of this position.} Unlike in our case, here $Z$ is not any \co{existence}\noo{(or limit of \co{distinctions} drawn by an\co{existence})} but some other element of \co{objective} and alreadydifferentiated reality.  The old and the new ships are identical with respect to their function, theirowner, their legal status, etc., but not with respect to the material from whichthey are made.  Sounds reasonable.  \thi{With respect to\ldots} is but a way ofpointing to some dimension along which no further \co{distinctions} have beenmade.  However, if we asked about what exactly constitutes the identity alongthis particular dimension, we would probably run into the similar, if notentirely the same problems as the traditional notion.This eventual reliance on the absolute identity (observed also in\citeauthor{McGinn}), is reflected in the formulations of relative identitywhich tend to involve absolutely distinct or identical objects. Thus young andold Oscar are claimed to be the same dog but distinct -- absolutely distinct --things, or as one says, logical objects.  The status of logical objects remainsa bit unclear, though they seem to be very similar to the limits of\co{distinctions} -- viewed not as \co{actual} such limits, but as the furtherindistinguishable residual points.\ftnt{\wo{Indistinguishable} is used here not for  mutual indiscernibility of $a$ and $b$ but for the absence of further  differentiation of a given limit $a$.}  \co{Distinctions} which can influenceidentity need not have any mental or linguistic character.  The logical objects,on the other hand, remind about mentally conditioned limits of distinctionswhich are relative to the expressive power of the applied language.  But one isanxious to emphasize that it is not what they are. On the contrary, they arerather like the \thi{substances} with their independent, absolutely distinct,being. They are not only further undistinguished but indistinguishable. The needfor such reservations arises from identifying (in often technical ways)distinguishability with the expressive power of a language. Hence to escaperelativity to the language, one must endow the ideal entities with their ownbeing. Thus a dog Oscar and the same dog, only thought without one hair, are thesame dogs but distinct -- absolutely distinct -- logical objects.\ftnt{The  absolute identity appears in a similar disguise in the attempt to handle the  Hobbes' variant of the Theseus' ship problem. Here not only the old ship $O$  gets replaced all the planks (becoming, perhaps a new ship, $N_1$) but also,  at the same time, an identical copy $N_2$ of the old ship $O$ is built from  the planks removed from $O$.  Both $N_1$ and $N_2$ seem to have equal claims  to be the same as the original $O$ but this, admitting transitivity of  equality, would make also $N_1=N_2$. So one tries to avoid identification  $N_1=O$ by postulating identity of $X$ and $Y$ with respect to $Z$ if both $X$  and $Y$ differ from $Z$ by at most one single part (or 5, or 20 parts).  Assuming that one knows what a part is (a part of a part of $X$ is probably a  part of $X$, but is an atom of a part of $X$ also a part of $X$?  --  merologists may argue), what is the $Z$ in this equation? Trying to break the  transitivity of identity across gradual replacement of the planks, $Z$ appears  as an ideal measure -- an ideal, perhaps the original ship $O$ retained in the  memory -- against which other instances are measured. It is thus only the  absolute identity of $Z$\noo{(which seems to acquire some characteristics of    Platonic idea)} and a sufficient proximity, similarity to it which make up  the whole. If this sounds plausible, let us imagine two (physically and  completely) distinct things, $T1\not=T2$, each composed of two parts  $T1=P1_{T1}+P2_{T1}$ and $T2=P1_{T2}+P2_{T2}$, such that for both  $i\in\{1,2\}:Pi_{T1}$ can be replaced with $Pi_{T2}$. Using $P1_{T2}+P2_{T1}$  as the comparator $Z$ we then obtain  \(T1=P1_{T1}+P2_{T1}=P1_{T2}+P2_{T1}=P1_{T2}+P2_{T2}=T2\)\\which does not look particularly plausible. One can keep adjusting theformulations and multiply the special side-conditions, but we will stop here.}%\newpThe logical objects seem indispensable for the \thi{relative identity theory} tobe itself. Without them it would be hard to distinguish it from the identity ofindiscernibles, for then identity of two objects could amount only to theobjects being the same $Z$ for every possible $Z$.  But as long as such\thi{absolutely identical logical objects} and the identity along the designateddimension remain, the theory can, perhaps, account for much of the common-senseusage of the {\em term and statements} of identity, but it does not seem tooffer any significant account of identity as such -- it only presses thequestion one step further.  It helps little to summon {\em the proper} form ofan identity statement as only \thi{$X$ is the same $F$ as $Y$}, when thestatements which we, in fact, make of the form \thi{$X$ is the same as $Y$} makeperfect sense (e.g., in mathematics, about people, about \thi{Morning Star} and\thi{Evening Star}.  Besides, admitting logical objects, there seems to be nodifference between the statement \wo{$X$ is the same logical object as $Y$},\wo{$X$ is absolutely the same as $Y$} and simply \wo{$X$ is the same as $Y$}.)Although in many cases of the statements of identity of things we might agreewith one or another variant of the relative identity statements, we take thequalification \wo{one or another} quite seriously. For any set of criteria onecan produce a counter-example forcing an adjustment of any specific theory inone or another way.Identity (at least identity of \co{actual} things) is a completely relativenotion, it is not any metaphysical absolute but an accident of an \co{existence}whichterminates \co{distinctions} at this, rather than that boundary. %\ftnt{The%   ships $O,N_1$ and $N_2$ can be legitimately considered the same by a captain%   who needs only one for the travel and views all three equally fit for it.%   (Notice that for him, the situation is entirely the same as it would be with%   only one ship present). Claiming that every possible distinction is relevant%   makes the three immediately distinct.}The only candidate to some metaphysical pretensions might be {\em the fact} ofterminating distinctions in such a way, the primitive and irreducible (eventhough relative) character of such limits.\noo{  In any case, no universally valid criteria of identity are to be expected.} \pa A final word on the relativity of identity. According to\refp{th:identity}, what is identical for me need not be for you, what I confuseas one and the same thing, you may be able to differentiate as two.Emphasizing relativity of identity to \co{existence}, we should keep in mindthat this is very different from saying that these \co{existences} have somedetermining or constitutive power over identities. Identities, like\co{distinctions}, are for the most {\em found} and not created (produced,posited, generated, projected) by the \co{existence}. Relativity need not haveanything to do with \thi{subjectivity}, for being found it retains the elementof being \co{founded}, which disappears only in the most \co{dissociated  experiences}.Furthermore, saying \wo{relative to \co{existence}}, we often (and in thecurrent context almost constantly) mean relativity to a {\em form of}\co{existence}.  Nobody decides what he wants to be identical and, moreover,what appears so will typically appear so to most (if not all) \co{existences} ofthe same form -- some things are equally identical to many. We will all agree onthe identity of this table here, or that tree over there. Just as there arepragmatic, and this involves also natural, reasons for drawing some\co{distinctions}, there are similar reasons for terminating them. The sensuousapparatus of humans will, under normal circumstances, deem some things identicalalmost irrespectively of who \co{actually} is involved in the situation. But asthe concerned contents become more \co{vague}, less prone to the narrow look of\co{actuality}, the differences can become more significant. Is the feeling ofjoy I have now, the same as the one I had yesterday? Is the love I experiencethe same as that experienced by the one I love? Is the city in which I live thesame city in which my neighbour lives? Wait! Here it is obviously the same city.Well, yes, but what constitutes its identity? Where does it end and where doesit begin? I always counted this particular suburb as a part of the city, whilefor my neighbour it was already outside. As with the \co{distinctions} ingeneral, the city does not have any \thi{essence}, any sharp boundary, althoughit seems to have some kernel, something which makes it {\em this} city. Allpeople may agree on the presence of such a kernel without, however, agreeing onthe precise boundaries -- they all may terminate the \co{distinctions} atslightly different points. \citet{There are no sharp divisions of   reality.}{IdealistView}{VI:4} Thus, although talkingabout the same city, they will \co{experience} and associate with it slightlydifferent \thi{essences}.\pa This pragmatic relativity of identity is about as far as the possibleanalogy with the \thi{relative identity theory}, as well as Locke and empiricismin general, goes. For we have no atoms, no logical objects, no basic \thi{ideas},\thi{perceptions}, \thi{impressions}, nor \thi{substances}. We do not share thedream to differentiate everything which can possibly be differentiated andthen, having thus obtained the \thi{absolute atoms}, to reconstruct the reality fromthem.% Although empiricist must, for practical reasons, stop the first part of the% project, he always thinks that it could be continued and attempts to carry out% the second part.Ireno Funes, the hero of a short story by Borges about perfect memory andinsomnia, would be a dream-hero of empiricism, nominalism and, so it seems, ofthe relative identity.  \citet{Not only was it difficult for him to see that the  generic symbol `dog' took in all the dissimilar individuals of all shapes and  sizes, it irritated him that the `dog' of three-fourteen in the afternoon,  seen in profile, should be indicated by the same noun as the dog of  three-fifteen, seen frontally.  [\ldots] He was the solitary, lucid spectator  of a multiform, momentaneous, and almost unbearably precise world.}{Funes}{}The perfect \co{precision} of minute distinctions does not disclose any eventualatoms but, on the contrary, dissolves all identities.  The search for suchatoms, for the most minute, ultimately self-identical elements can always becarried on further.  It stops, from the point of view of metaphysics ofprinciples and sufficient reasons, at a completely arbitrary point; it stops atsome point only because for one reason or another, typically unconscious,sometimes confused, but usually a good reason of avoiding \thi{unbearable  precision}, we stop to \co{distinguish}. \citet{My {\em life} consists in my  being content to accept many things.}{Certain}{344. A more  existential expression of the search for the ultimate foundation and despair over  its eternal invisibility is decadent boredom trying to entertain itself with  merely aesthetic variations. Count des Esseintes in \citeauthor*{aRebours}, is a  good example, trying to fill the bottomless emptiness with more and more  subtle distinctions which only deepen the sense of emptiness. The distinctions  of advertisement industry and ever new fashions, artificial needs craving only  for more novelties, reflect on the social scale the despair over the lack of  substance, mistakenly identified with the \thi{objective substances}.}Just like the ability to handle a wide variety of distinctions tells us something about one's intelligence, so the points at which one stopsdistinctions and rests satisfied tell us something about what kind of person oneis. \citet{What people accept as a justification -- shews how they think and  live.}{WittPI}{I:325.\noo{ A good philosopher says only what he {\em can} say --  and keeps silent.

One may wonder\wo{How do I know that this cup today and the one yesterday are the same?}, not\wo{How do I know that this cup here is the same?} nor \wo{How do I know that  this cup here and the one over there are (not) the same?}Since time and space are but \equi\ \co{aspects} arising from\co{spatio-temporality}, a brief comment might be in place.\pa If you see a building so high that you can not simultaneously see both its top andits bottom, you do not wonder. Perhaps you should? If you can never see it in itstotality (say, it is surrounded by other buildings which make it impossible tosee it whole from a distance), if you can never perceive it in a unity of one\co{act}, isn't the problem the same as with the same cup today and yesterday?Recalling one of the multiple senses of unity listed by Aristotle in\btit{Metaphysics}, V:6, one will immediately point to the possibility of acontinuous perception of the whole building from top to bottom; the continuitywhich does not obtain with the cup yesterday and today. Let us first refine the claim \refp{th:identity}: %\thesisnonr{Identity isa limit of \co{distinctions} \co{represented} by a \co{sign}, that is,contrived to the \co{actuality} of a single\co{act}.}\label{th:idsign}This \co{sign} will be, typically, an abstract \co{sign}, not merelyan aspect of the thing, but, for instance, a word which can be madefully \co{actual} even though the thing itself can not.  It is not the\co{sign} which establishes identity -- it only \co{represents} it. It \co{represents} the \co{actual} limit of \co{distinctions} withinthe \hoa. This horizon sets the limit on the possible \co{experiences} ofidentity -- identity is always \co{an experience} consummated fullywithin this horizon where the \co{non-actual} aspects of \thi{theidentical} appear through the \co{sign}.%\pa The continuity of relevance to identity is always continuity in time -- tThe continuous perception of the building, although traversinga region of space, is important because it does not create any\thi{gaps} in time.  For the \co{actual reflection} this continuityamounts to the unbroken presence of the \co{sign} and (aspects of) itsperceptual correlate.  You see the different stories of the building butthe \co{sign}, \thi{this building}, is kept continuously (even if not\co{reflectively}) as your sight moves along the walls.  Space, in any case its region which is accessibleto the observation, is exactly the field where such a perceptualcontinuity is possible.%In a manner slightly more%general than before (and not entirely precise), we could say that it%is the field of simultaneityIn the moment a break occurs, when you enter a shop and go out again or turnaround, the break of continuity is still a temporal break -- just as whenyou close your eyes, the building disappears from your sight {\em for some  time}. After such a break you still see the same building -- there is simplynot the slightest reason, in fact, not the slightest possibility of imaginingthe two to be different. The continuity of space (not the \co{objective}, but experiential space) has thesame character of endowing the continuous region with identity; any \thi{break}represents a \co{distinction} separating one thing from another. We could say,just as the perceptual field is the scope of simultaneity, so the possibility ofcontinuous perception is circumscribed as the ideal limit of simultaneity of\co{distinct} things in space. The identity of things seen only in theirspatial, simultaneous dimension is unproblematic -- it is the self-identity of\co{immediately} given \co{distinctions} and their limits. The \thi{gaps} inspace are the \co{distinctions} we \co{recognise} as separating different things. The\thi{gaps} in time have another import -- they reflect only the\co{dissociation} of \co{experience} into \co{actualities}.  As long as we canmaintain the continuity across time, the identity of a given object might remainas unproblematic as in its spatial \co{immediacy}.  The problem for\co{reflection} is that such a continuity does not, in general, obtain forthings which it would like to consider the same. The continuity between the cupyesterday and today is broken. And \la{vice versa}, whenever such an onticcontinuity is broken, it involves time.  Trivially: time is the dimension alongwhich things may cease to be the same. And a bit less trivially: identity is{\em the means} \co{reflection} employs to keep them the same across\co{dissociated actualities}. The question whether my sofa today is really thesame as the one yesterday is asking about the reasons I might find to concludethey are not. \wo{The reasons I might have} means simply the \co{distinctions}it might be possible to draw between the two. There are none (none of relevance,at least), and the sofa\herenow\ remains connected to (the same as) the sofa which has receded into thepast \co{actuality} of yesterday -- this \thi{gap} in time has been covered up.\noo{But one will object, because the identity of the sofa has nothing to do  with the reasons I might have to consider it one or two. Of course, but as  long as \co{I} cannot see any reasons, as long as \co{I} cannot distinguish  the two, \co{I} am bound to consider it the same.}\paThus, identity is a truly \co{transcendent} relation when viewed exclusivelyfrom the perspective of mere \co{actuality} -- it represents a noumenal $x$which lies beyond every \co{actual} appearance. Some such$x$'s can arise as results of \co{reflective} construction. But most common and natural ones precede it andare solidified as limits of \co{distinctions} prior to conscious, let alone attentive efforts.\noo{And yet, every \co{actual} appearance is \co{experienced}  as but an aspect, a side, a property of this $x$. For $x$ has been solidified  as a limit of some \co{distinctions}, if you allow me, we have created $x$ by  \co{distinguishing} it from all other things and by fixing its  \co{distinctions}.}  In either case, the \co{experience dissociated} intoseparate \co{actualities}, temporality split into a mere succession of\thi{nows}, call for an account of the \co{experienced} continuity.%$x$ provides such an account.\thesisnonr{Identity is a \co{reflection} -- a \co{representation} --of the \co{experienced} continuity; it is the \co{trace} which, \thi{filling thegaps} of \co{objective} time, {makes up} for its broken continuity which is nolonger \co{actually experienced} through the \co{dissociated} nows.}\label{th:idcont}\co{Actual} identity, the \thi{repetition as recurrence}, the equality of $a$and $b$, is an \co{aspect} of conscious \co{experience} which lives time through\co{actualities}. But it becomes {\em a problem} for \co{reflection} which,taking its \co{concepts} from the assumed obviousness of \co{immediacy}, triesto account by their means for the \co{unity} which \co{transcends} every\co{actuality}. The identity of \co{objects}, things and ideas is, indeed, avery fragile \co{aspect} of their \co{experience}.  Just like analysis candissolve every issue, it can likewise dissolve every identity, it can make\co{reflection} disregard it as \thi{unreal} because not given \co{objectively}.And from the threat of \thi{unreality} there emerge ghosts of \thi{ideal}entities -- ideal $x$ of which $a$ and $b$ are only different appearances andwhose recurring appearances could be, in principle, repeated \la{ad infinitum}.We have earlier seen universals which could be viewed from exactly thesame angle: accounting for the recurring repetitions of the same $x$. Ideallimits, like regulative ideas, \co{posited} in the unthinkable infinity of time,try functioning as the norms or else the ultimate witnesses to the absolutetruth which will be disclosed only in the eventual fullness of times. Of course,idealities deserve to be dissolved, but the crucial difference is whether anideal is merely \co{posited}, or whether it is also \co{reflecting} some deeperreality.  A total dissolution of everything which stretches beyond the limits ofever narrower \co{immediacy} is only the ultimate expression of the\co{objectivistic illusion}, of the thirst for the \thi{givens}, and the despairover their absence. A dissolved self cannot avoid dissolving the encounteredthings though this disease, like many others, bears the seeds of a possiblerevival.% The more intense the \co{reflective dissociation}, the more problematic, and% also the more important identity becomes.\noo{\pa \co{Externality} of an \co{immediate object} is the paradigmatic structureof identity, and most  examples and notions of identityare based on the \thi{substantiality} of \co{objects}.  Although\co{reflection} tends to ascribe the \co{object} noumenal, simpleself-identity, it is by no means a simple entity.  It is a limit of\co{reflective dissociations} brought to an end. Since these \co{distinctions} can always be carried further, there isno wonder that one has always had tremendous difficulties withdisplaying assumed \thi{basic objects} or else \thi{essences} ofthings.  \co{Object}'s identity appears noumenal because it is foundedin the pre-\co{reflective} \co{experience} on the basis of earlier\co{distinctions} and \co{recognitions} which effected just this, andnot another, \co{cut} from the background.  Its assumedindependence, the effect of \co{representation}, \co{doubleseparation} from the background is an \co{aspect} of its identity. %Something is an \co{object} only to%the extent it has been so \co{externalised}. The limit of %\co{distinctions}, so \co{externalised}, }\ad{\mine Totality of visibles: $a_1+a_2+a_3+\ldots = x$}\label{minId}Consideration of equality, of identity at the level of \co{actuality}, took somespace because it is where it belongs. Equality binds \co{dissociated actualities} together.It appears always (unless reduced to the empty $x=x$ of a given \co{object}, ofan \co{immediate reflection that it is}) as a \co{transcendent} relation,stretching beyond the \co{actualities} scattered across different points of timeand bringing them together.  But it {\em can} do it, and it is {\em needed} todo it, only because our being is not exhausted by the \co{dissociated  actualities} but has itself \co{unity} which \co{transcends} every\co{actuality}.Identity may be an \co{object} of \co{an experience}, as happens every time onerealises that $a$ is {\em the same as} $b$. This, inadvertently, requires both$a$ and $b$ to be themselves \co{actual}, or in any case thought as such. Thus,every statement of identity requires, or as the case may be reduces, its objectto be at the level of \co{actuality}.  There are however cases when such a reductionis hard, if at all possible to imagine.  What about the infatuation which I felta week ago and I am still feeling? Is it the same or not? It is the same, itconcerns the same person, it has some continuity.  But a week ago it had aslightly different flavour, I did not then see this person to have something ofvanity in herself, while I see it now. But it is still the same because\ldots Because I \co{re-cognise} the feeling and give it a name? The tendency to consider it the same is stronger than that, but only as long as itretains enough of the similarity. With time it may simply -- and continuously! --change, perhaps even into disgust, pity, repulsion. Then onemay find as many reasons to call it the same as reasons to call it different. Itis the same infatuation turned into repulsion, the same fascination turned intoboredom. Or was it, perhaps, from the start repulsion disguised as infatuation,boredom disguised as fascination? Whether the same or different, it does not matter because what matters in this case is what one is feelingand thinking, perhaps, also what one felt and thought before, but not if thisthought or feeling now is equal to some other.\paThe limiting case of \co{non-actualities} which, nevertheless, seem to requirean answer to the question about their identity is that of a person and theworld. The former was treated in \ref{sec:I} and\ref{sec:Self}, so here we only comment briefly on the latter. But everything said about the \co{totality}of the world applies equally to personal identity viewed from the level of\co{mineness}.% These two aspects -- that identity is \co{founded} in the unity of a being% \co{transcending actuality} and, at the same time, it reduces its objects to the% level of \co{actuality} -- ... brings in the questions about personal identity% and the unity of the world. Seen only from this level they have essentially the% same form. We will elaborate on personal unity in the following section, so here% we concentrate on the world only...%\subsub{Unity and totality}\co{Complexes} are \co{reflectively dissociated} into, or \co{reflectively}built from, their \thi{constituent parts}.  Most thinking is spent on constructionof such \co{complexes} where, as Pierce says, \citet{unity is nothing but {\em    consistency}.}{PierceFourIncap}{p.71. We give the word\wo{unity} a different meaning, but for the moment let us keep it this way.}Sure, a \co{complex} may be a mere gathering of unrelated parts, like a \thi{composite substance}, a heap of stones, but it is usually some sense ofaim and purpose, or just consistency, which makes us consider this rather thanthat as a \co{complex}, as a well-connected \co{complex} of parts, a table, acar, a heap of stones\ldots We certainly won't attempt to improve on Pierce'sconsistency trying to determine in what it possibly might consist.  We won'tbecause the possibilities may be innumerable.Although \co{reflection} would like to arrange everything as a \co{complex}, a\co{complex} of \co{complexes}, etc., in some cases the principle oforganisation can be completely unclear. One takes then often refuge to a\co{posited} limit -- applying some principle to the \co{actual} elements beyondthe limit of \co{actual} possibility, one claims to obtain some ideal limit.Quoting the limit construction one may easily happen to be very proud from theanalogy to the converging series in mathematical analysis. Unfortunately, theimage of countability and convergence is presupposed by all such limit\thi{constructions} in philosophy. But this means that constructions do notgenerate anything but only utilise the assumption of a prior unity.  All suchlimits, regulative ideas, posited ideals are but attempts to regain theprimordial unity in which they are \co{founded} and without which they could noteven be imagined.\ftnt{This does not mean that various ideal limits so  \co{posited} are always concretely \co{founded} in the respective unities.  There is only one \co{unity}, and the \co{totality} founded in it has two  respective aspects: of \co{myself} and of the world. But any particular limit  is always posited under some principle which is merely applied to the already  assumed totality.  The idea of \co{totality} is founded in the \co{unity}, the  principle so applied -- furnishing the assumed consistency to the  \co{totality} -- may be almost anything one can imagine. } They yield\co{totalities} which, at best, are only reflected by the respective limitconstructions.  A \co{totality} is but a gathering of its parts, is {\em one}only because the parts have been \co{posited} as a collection and are consideredas one. \co{Totalities} are not perfect unities but only \citet{illuminations of  combinations}{Proclus}{\para64} or, to put it directly, just heaps of stones.This is in fact as much as \co{actual} thinking is capable of making out of theworld, or personal identity -- the sum total, the \co{totality} of its\co{visible} elements. Whether it should be called empiricism or pantheismdepends only on how much divine character is ascribed to the \co{totality} ofthe world.\noo{\pa The concept (if any) of the \thi{objective}, that is, \thi{external world}has quite a schizophrenic character. On the one hand, it must be truly\thi{external}, completely independent from us, in order to be solidly\thi{objective}. On the other hand, it is to provide the truth and correctivefor our life and thinking and so, we need an access to it. No wonder that onehas to invent \thi{things in themselves}, transcendental subjects and othermonsters to make the ends meet.  The more sober ones stay aloof from the wholeproblem.  Like most philosophical problems, it has been solved -- not becauseanybody offered a satisfying solution, but because everybody got bored andtired.  \wo{Sure, the world is there -- let's talk about something more  interesting.} Sure, it is. But what is it that \thi{is there}, what is\thi{this world}?}\pa Saying \wo{external world} one usually identifies it with \co{externality}of \co{objects}. How do we think, what do we mean by \wo{the external world}?Easy, look at this table in front of you -- obviously, it is \thi{there}, it is\co{objective}, \co{external}. The \thi{external world} is just the \co{totality} ofsuch external things. This is how much we are able to make out of the assumed\thi{concept} of externality.But, do you remember the \co{objectivistic illusion}(I:\ref{objectivisticillusion})?  What \co{totality}?  There is no \co{totality}of {\em all} things, there are just \co{external objects}, plenty of them, butthat's it.  And certainly, the \co{totality} of {\em all} things isinaccessible.  It is never experienced, never given, nothing like that everconfronts us in {\em any} \co{actual experience}; there is no \co{totality} ofthings; things, \co{objects} do not sum up to anything, least of all to anyworld.  At best, this world appears as their ideal, that is, impossible andinaccessible limit.The meaning of asymmetry of Being (I:\ref{asymm}) is that lower things never sumup to give something higher -- higher level is inaccessible to the categories ofthe lower ones. \co{Above} the \co{totality} of \co{objects}, there is the\co{unity}, we might say, of the world, or perhaps, of the horizon of\co{experience}, which precedes \co{experiences} of individual \co{objects}; the\co{unity} of which the \co{posited totality} is but an imperfect \co{sign}.Bracketing this \co{unity}, this \co{aspect} of all \co{experiences}, and thentrying to account for the \thi{external world} or, perhaps, for its\thi{externality}, one ends up accounting for the \co{externality} of an\co{object}, while trying to account for \thi{the world}, one ends up accountingfor nothing but only \co{positing} the ideal \co{totality} of things.%But what is an \co{external object} other than an \co{object} of \co{an%  experience}?  \co{Externality} of \co{objects} is, unlike the \thi{externality of the world},\co{an experience}.  A thing, an \co{object} is not just \co{external} -- it is{\em experienced} as such.  Things are independent, \co{external} and, at thesame time, \co{experienced}.  To be independent and \co{external}, they do nothave to be inaccessible -- they are \co{objective} in virtue of the veryrelativity to our experiences.But \thi{the world}, the \thi{external world}? By its very nature, it isimpossible to have \co{an experience} of it -- as a \co{totality}, it alwaysextends beyond any \co{actual experience}. So, perhaps, every experience is onlya partial experience of the world? Perhaps\ldots But it would seem that apartial experience of $X$ is not an experience of $X$ but of its part, and ifone insists on it being a part {\em of} $X$, then $X$ must come from elsewhere.Every \co{actual experience} is \co{an experience} {\em of} its \co{object} orsituation, but not {\em of} the world. And yet, the world, the \thi{objective  world} stays in the background, the \thi{unified world} haunts every\co{actuality} and is \co{experienced} underneath every particularexperience\ldots% But then why do we need to speak about such {\em a} world, about such {\em a}% totality?\ad{Invisible unity: $\bullet$}\label{pa:perspectives} As said in\ref{sec:thisWorld}, the \thi{wholeness}, the \co{unity} of the world is notconstituted in terms of \co{actualities}. We feel compelled to accept it as a\co{totality} (and this always means, {\em one} \co{totality}) because, lack ofany unifying principle notwithstanding, its \co{unity} is \co{experienced} asanother pole of the \co{unity} of \co{myself}.  We would not get the idea of anabsolute \co{totality} of the whole world (nor of \co{ourselves}), if no\co{unity} were \co{experienced} prior to it.  \citet{Every whole composed of  parts participates in a unity preceding these parts.}{Proclus}{\para69  \citef{Once there is any manifold, there must be a precedent    unity.}{Plotinus}{V:6.3} We should, however, be careful with embracing all  variants of neo-Platonic units too enthusiastically. The \thi{wholes} and  \thi{unities} have much more conceptual flavor, and are not distinguished from  the \co{immediate} identity. In fact, the contentless self-identity of the  most immediate object is taken, here as elsewhere, as an epitome of unity.  Even the justification of this very proposition ends with the possibility of  the preceding units being just \thi{indecomposable atoms}, which must lie at the bottom  of any division.}  Every whole participates in the \co{unity} which\co{founds} its \thi{wholeness}.% \co{Totality} of the world is \co{founded} in the \co{unity} of \co{existence},% eventually, in the uniqueness of \co{self} and the \co{unity} of \co{one}.%in \co{Self} which \co{transcends} every particular determinationBut we have not seen any \co{unity}. So far, it might rather seem like there isnothing \thi{really} identical, nothing possessing \co{absolute unity} which isnot merely relative to our ability to make, and suspend, \co{distinctions}.  Isall that remains only \citet{a permanently tentative look?}{PontyPerc}{346-7}Indeed, every \co{visible} determination of anything \co{invisible} is by itsvery nature only tentative and approximate.

The problem of the possibility of knowingparticulars amounts indeed to the identity of indiscernibles. I can point atthis cup but all I know about it, except for its being \co{actually} given here,is the same as what I know about the indiscernible cup standing in the cupboard.Which of the two is here is entirely uninteresting and healthy \co{reflection}will never (in normal situations) worry about such identities. The situation isentirely different with human beings. I not only can point at Paul sitting nextto me; I actually know him, and knowing him is something infinitely more thanknowing his \thi{human essence}, than knowing him as being a man\la{simpliciter}. Knowing Paul is as different from knowing Peter, as Paul isdifferent from Peter, and they are infinitely different (even though they aretwins). On the other hand, knowing one cup is exactly the same as knowinganother, though indiscernible, one.  We know individuals (that is, \co{existing}individuals, not merely particulars) because they are not only limits of\co{distinctions} which always can be refined further, but because they nevercan be. To know a person transcends by far not only simple \co{conceptual}constructions but also deepest psychological insights, for it amounts to a\co{recognition}, beyond the character traits and psychological features, of theunrepeatable uniqueness of this person -- not as an abstract property but as themost \co{concrete} truth of fact.  In short, we distinguish between the\co{unity} of \co{existence} and a mere identity of \co{actual} things.\co{Totality} is an intermediate notion which arises whenever the desired\thi{principle of unity}, establishing the whole of \co{actualities}, can not beseen.\co{Self} is the \co{confrontation} with the \co{one}, and its \co{unity} is butthe uniqueness of this \co{confrontation}.\ftnt{\wo{Unique} and \wo{unity}  originate in the same Latin \wo{unus} -- one.} Each \co{birth} creates a new,unique individual. At first it is only a \co{virtual} kernel from which thisindividual will eventually develop in all \co{actual} manifestations.  It doesnot contain any \thi{complete notion}, it does not contain all the future andpast \thi{contingencies} which this individual may encounter in life, and whichmight be needed if the unity of a substance were constituted by its concept orproperties. Irrespectively of the conceptual indistinguishability from any other\co{birth}, it is an event of the \co{absolute} beginning, emergence from\co{nothingness}. As such, it establishes an ineradicable, numerical \co{unity},\la{haecceitas} of this individual, which is his \co{origin}, the point beyondthought and \co{experience}, where he touches \co{nothingness}.\ftnt{Thus we  must finally admit the misuse of this Scotist term. According to Duns Scotus,  every individual thing has the individuating entity which, so to speak,  follows after and in addition to the being of its essence, \la{esse essentia},  endowing it with the actual and individual existence, \la{esse existentia}. We  do not worry so much about the identities of \co{actual} things, and we do not  see so much difference between human \co{existence} and its \thi{essence} --  the unique individuality constituted by the \co{confrontation} with the  \co{one} can be equally identified with both, and \la{haecceitas} refers to  this triple identification.} No \co{visible} criteria account for this\co{unity}.  \citet{If we take wholly away all Consciousness of our Actions and  Sensations, especially Pleasure and Pain, and the concernment that accompanies  it, it will be hard to know wherein to place personal  Identity.}{LockUnd}{II:I.11.\noo{One can easily find similar quotations in    Hume, other empiricists, even James.}} It is not easy to imagine what\thi{taking wholly away} might mean, but allowing that, it would be exactly theplace where to look for \thi{personal Identity}. \citet{[I]f we had nothing  distinct in our perceptions, nothing heightened, or of a stronger flavour, so  to speak, we would be in a permanent stupor. And this is the condition of the  completely naked monad.}{Monad}{\para24}\pa \co{Unity} is the \co{absolute} identity -- \co{absolute}, that is, trans-phenomenal, relative to \co{nothing}.  It is not a consistency of a\co{totality}, neither is it the identity of \co{dissociated actualities}, buttheir ultimate \co{foundation} -- the \co{virtuality} of the origin.%% from which any given variety emerges.\noo{Perhaps, we should follow Aristotle%   and say, it is \gre{entelecheia}.[Psyche in Antiquity, I, p.69] But, as life%   principle, it was introduced by Hans Driesch. For Aristotle, it was kind of%   continuing-completeness, being-at-the-end, in analogy with \gre{endelecheia}:%   continuity/persistence.}%It does not have \thi{parts} but \co{aspects}.  It is not an intrinsicallyrelative totality where the \co{actual} elements are put side-by-side andconnected by another element, a \co{visible} relation; it is a \nexus, a\co{virtual} center, in which they have, as yet, not received their \co{actual}determinations and in which they are inseparably woven together.  It is notidentity for the \co{aspects} are \co{virtually} distinct, although these\co{distinctions} have not, as yet, reached the crisp delineations which theywill eventually obtain in the \co{actual experience} and\co{reflection}.\ftnt{That the \co{virtuality} of the origin has not {\em as yet}  been \co{precisely} separated indicates not only the temporal dimension -- the  higher levels, the earlier hypostases remain \co{present} as the lower ones  emerge.  The unities of various aspects, their \co{virtual} \nexuss\ are  \co{experienced} thoroughly and intimately, even if \co{reflection} focuses  its attention only on their \co{dissociated} \co{aspects}. Thus \co{unity} is  a constant element of \co{experience}, the constant \co{rest} which looms in the  background and for ever refuses to be drawn down to the categories of  \co{actuality}.  }According to Cusanus, \citet{there is only one essence of all, which is  participated differently.  It is participated differently because [\ldots] two  things cannot be perfectly alike and, consequently, participate one essence  precisely and equally.}{DDI}{I:VII.48-49\noo{We, on the other hand, view all    \co{existences} as participating (in any case, as being ontologically    \co{founded}) precisely and equally in \co{one}.}} Hmmm\ldots What is theground and what the effect here?  Here is a clue: \citetib{The universe, as most  perfect, has preceded all things in the order of nature, as it were, so that  it could be each thing in each thing.}{DDI}{II:5.117. It should not be too  difficult to draw close analogies to the unity of the Leibniz's system, his  pre-established harmony, reflection of the whole universe in every monad, and  the (resulting) principle of identity of indiscernibles.}%The universal, \thi{only one essence} is hardly anything obtained by identifyingindiscernibles. In \co{actual} terms it is obtained by identifying discernibles,the incomprehensible \la{coincidentia oppositorum}. We do not need such a\la{coincidentia}, because \co{actuality} is not our beginning.  The \co{one} isthat which precedes all possible discrimination; if you like, something alwaysassumed, never deduced. Its \co{unity} is not reducible to \co{actual}observations, for it \co{founds} the unity of each level.  The \co{one} is the\co{unity} of the \co{chaos}, \co{chaos} is the unity of \co{experience} and\co{experience} is the unity of \co{experiences}.  Or more specifically,\co{virtual signification} is the unity of \co{recognition} which, in turn,\co{founds} the unity of \co{aspects} involved in \co{representation}; or\co{simultaneity} is the unity of \co{spatio-temporality} and of \co{awareness}which \co{found}, respectively, the unity of space, of time and of\co{reflective consciousness}.  But these \co{founded} differences do not changetheir \co{founding unity}.  Ultimately, every human \co{existence}\thi{participates equally}, in the ontological order, the \thi{only \co{one}  essence of all}. The difference is the difference of indiscernibles, is thedifference between one \co{absolute} beginning and others which all, beyond thenumerical difference, are indiscernible \co{unities}.\pa The ultimate \co{unity} is the \co{one}: the \co{indistinct} is the ultimatelimit of all \co{distinctions} and of the very possibility of\co{distinguishing}, remaining forever beyond their horizon. Repetition and \thi{recurrence} are not mere accidents; they provide an abstract,that is \co{actual} and often \co{precise}, characterisation of allour being -- \co{experiencing} the {repetitions} of the \co{one},\co{recognising} \co{one} through Many, \co{experiencing} italways in new ways, in new \co{actualities}, from new perspectives\ldots  The\co{one} is not an \co{object} of any \co{actual experience}, all such\co{experiences}, all \co{distinctions} are but manifestations of the\co{one}, always under different forms, in different \co{actual}clothes.  The \co{one} is \co{experienced} but only through, or under,these variations -- it is \co{one} and the same, and yet,\co{actually} always different, as one \co{actual experience} isdifferent from another.  The \co{one} is \co{experienced} only throughall the \co{distinctions} and thus it is the ultimate violation ofindiscernibility of identicals -- in \co{actual experiences} it isthoroughly different, it is never given, and hence never given as the same, andyet it is always itself, always identical.Our being -- and our understanding, in particular -- is stretched betweenthese two limiting poles: on the one hand, the idealistic intuition ofeverything being but a manifestation of \co{one} and the same and, on the otherhand, the fact which from the \co{reflective  experience}'s standpoint is incontestable: that everything is a separate entityrelated only, if at all, ideally to something else. It might be tempting toconstruct a contradiction but the two do not contradict each other -- they onlyexpress the extreme and complementary \co{aspects} of \co{existence} which\co{experiences one} only through many.  The great challenge of \co{reflection}starting from the \co{dissociated experiences} is ideal abstraction -- to\co{re-construct} (parts of) this variety as manifestations of the same: starmovements and falling apples as gravitational force; matter and work as energy;addition and multiplication as monoidal structure; God of the New Testament andGod of the Old Testament as the same God, perhaps, even as the God of Muslimsand the non-god of Buddhists; the yesterday's pleasure and today's conflict asaspects of the same loving relationship.%For ideal abstraction it is never enough to merely claim the identity%-- being a {\em reflective} enterprise, it has to make it plausible%for \co{reflection}, how the \co{distinctions} of \co{reflective%experience} can plausibly be seen as manifestations of the same.\citet{What a shock of {\em recognition} it was (as it actuallyhappened to me) while studying with wonder the plate of Corotengraving -- to see it suddenly as a delicious episode from`Parsifal'.}{ValeryCorot}{p.143}Insights of the identity ofdifferences are among the greatest intellectual pleasures.  One knows experiences  which after a long and tedious workbring two apparently unrelated ends of the reasoning chain into aunity of a single realisation.%Such experiences have also a different modus.We have a problem in front of us which \thi{does not fit},which we can not grasp because %having a uniform formulationwe feel that there is something which evades and prevents us from solving it.And then comes an \thi{Aha!} -- a crucial \co{distinction} (and connection is,too, a \co{distinction}) which solves the problem, which makes everything fallon its place.  It may be too much of subtleties, but we would say that it is notthe evading \co{distinction} which brings the pleasure when it reaches the levelof consciousness.  This \co{distinction} has been there all the time, albeit,merely in the \co{vague}, \co{virtual} form of the cognitive dissonance, of theuneasy feeling that something is missing.  The pleasure arises from the factthat this \co{distinction}, now clearly \co{re-cognised}, \thi{makes everything  fall on its place} establishing a new unity.The power of thought lies precisely in this: to \co{re-cognise} {repetitions},to \co{re-cognise} the same in a variety of differences.  Only that, as far as\co{reflection} is concerned, it is seldom enough to claim the underlyingidentity -- it has to be \co{reflectively represented}, it has to become\co{visible} for \co{reflection} if it is to be \co{actually} given andconvincing.  Appreciating all such thoughts and smaller or greater experiences,one must always remember the great danger of any claims to unity misconstrued asuniformity, of claims which simply try to erase the differences in thepostulated but never \co{experienced} pseudo-unity.  For better or worse, in thesphere of \co{actual experiences}, \co{unity} is reflected mostly as onlyrelative identities.  Rilke's verse:%\begin{verse}{\small{\em Wer rechnet userer Ertrag? Wer trennt\\uns von den alten, den vergangenen Jahren?\\Was haben wir seit Anbeginn erfahren, \\als dass sich eins im anderen erkennt?~\ftnt{\citeauthor*{RilkeEsWinkt}}}}\end{verse}%notices the fact, but this fact has to be rendered \co{concrete} inevery particular case: the reflection of one in another, the gatheringof \co{actual distinctions} into a unity, has to be established foreach situation or problem and, often, it has to be established againand again to remind us constantly that \wo{[i]f many participate in one, they  are unified in their relation to the one} even though \citet{they are  different from each other to the degree, in which they are many.}{Proclus}{\para66}The highest \co{unity} does not dissolve the differentiation of the lowerlevels, does not mingle distinct elements in a flat uniformity. On the contrary,it lets them remain differentiated, even opposed to each other, for all such lower oppositions and conflicts do not contradict thegenuine \co{unity}. \pa Eventually, the \co{absolute unity} is the \co{unity} of the \co{one}.  Theundifferentiated, \co{indistinct one} is one and the same, is the \co{unity}underlying -- that is, in the order of ontological \co{founding}, preceding --all the \co{distinctions}.  This \co{unity} finds its \co{concrete} place, its\la{imago}, in the beings \co{separated} directly from, and hence\co{confronted} directly with the \co{one}.  \co{Self}, the \co{virtual} centerof every \co{existence}, \co{founded} in the \co{one}, \co{founds} the\co{unity} of the whole \co{existence}. The lower form of this \la{imago} is thefact of \co{myself} being a repetition, a repetition of the unique event of\co{birth}, and then \co{my self}, of the \thi{inborn possibility}. \co{My}uniqueness is not constituted by anything more particular, but is given to \co{me}. Every \co{existence},to the extent it is an \co{existence}, is unique and as such but a repetition ofany other \co{existence}: to the extent they \woo{participate in \co{One}, they  are one in the relation to the \co{One}.}{Proclus \para 66 - another  translation of Ibid.}  I am unique and you are unique and in this uniquenesswe are both the same.  There is no paradox here -- only the primitive characterof the \co{unity} of \co{existence} (if one likes, of the numerical difference ofindiscernibles) which is \co{founded} in the ultimate \co{invisibility} of\co{birth} from the \co{origin}.  At the level of \co{actuality}, this is againreflected in the repetition as recurrence of the same, in the temporal identityof \co{actual} things, as well as in \co{me} seen as the merely \co{actual ego}being the same now as \co{I} was yesterday.  Finally, in the \co{immediacy} of asingle \co{act}, the \co{unity} finds its \co{reflection} as the self-identityof the \co{immediately} given \co{object} and as the unproblematic self-identityof the \co{subject}, of the \co{immediate act} of \la{cogito}. In all cases,these lower self-identities are only borrowed, are only \co{founded}manifestations of the primordial \co{unity} which \co{transcends} them all and, hence, remains unaffected by their possible disturbances. \noo{\sep    Merological essentialism: each part of the body belongs to the soul and  contributes to its identity (we are here still within the actuality dominated  thinking, although entities we are considering are known to be non-actual)...    called by somebody the \wo{simple view} (but here only of personal identity)  distinct from the   environment (the imitated gestures). E.g., \citeauthor*{Meltz77,Meltz83,Meltz89},  \citeauthor*{Gall96}. We are not interested in precise timing of events but  the fact that even psychological research draws the empirically  discernible border of  the emergence of (a residual \nexus\ of) self to the few minutes after birth,  accords with our view much better than the earlier estimates (e.g., of  \citeauthor*{Piaget62}, followed by \citeauthor*{Ponty64}) which denied the possibility  of such an imitation before 8, and even 12 month.    \subsubnonr{Summarising identity...}  Just like the problems of identity arise from the antinomic attempts to apply  the substantial self-identity of \co{immediacy} to \co{actually} distinct  appearances, so the problem continues as the attempt to form an identity  embracing the whole world. The identity does not obtain, however, and the  closest \co{actual} thinking comes to such a unity is the totality of  \co{actualities}, the epitome of pantheism. Then such a totality is tried as  the principle of self which, however, never seems more than \co{myself}. No  unity is obtained but a mere collection, and there are those who seem  satisfied with that.    Lower categories seldom yield any insight when carried up to higher levels.    Although the \co{conceptual} formation follows the bottom-up, the motivation  is really coming from above. The question about identity of distinct  appearances would not arose without these appearances being already somehow  unified; the question about the totality/unity of everything could not be  asked, if the totality were not somehow \co{experienced}. The conceptual  attempts simply to clarify these questions within the \hoa.    But since their motives come from above, one has to reach beyond to account  for them.    \pa It is the person - grounded in the one - which founds unity; but the unity  concerns the whole being. This, however, does not change anything for the  virtuality of the personal origin cannot be separated from the whole personal  being (just like one is only as and through chaos; just like all levels are  present in every most immediate actuality).    But this unity can be relativised to any of the lower levels psychological  explanations can not do here anything more then elsewhere, namely, reduce  everything to mere subjectivism, perhaps even solipsism, reduce identity to  the mere sense of identity. This does apply at the level of mineness where the  sense of being the same person, myself, is often of primary importance,  although    At the level of ego, identity is often attempted reduced to the sameness of  the body, animal, and sometimes even of brain. Now, it is true that I can not  exist without my body    So it looks again like Kantian unity of apperception founding the unity of the  object. To an extent it is so...

No, of course, it is a command, not a statementexpressing a proposition. But then, suppose you close the door and he says:\wo{No, I did not mean it, I was only joking}. The command was not trueor\ldots? The command was not meant as a command or even better, the sentence,the \co{sign} which usually means a command in this particular situation did notmean it. It was a joke, not a true command. One would probably wish that we getrid of this \wo{true}, but we will not. The word \wo{true} used about a command,a work of art, a feeling or almost anything is \citet{put in front of another  word in order to show that this word is to be understood in its proper,  unadulterated sense.}{FregeTruth}{p.86} Thus a true command is a command, andnot a joke.  But if a \co{sign} expressing a command can be a joke, is it notfully natural and legitimate to speak also about \wo{true command} anddistinguish it from, well, \wo{untrue} ones? This is not much different fromdistinguishing a command from a non-command, but the crucial issue is that wehave a \co{sign}, a sentence, which although usually is one may also be theanother. Just like Tarski formed originally the biconditionals for propositions%\equ{The sentence \wo{X} is true if and only if X. \label{equ:bicond}}%one can form a biconditional for almost every word and a thing $x$%\begin{equation}\equ{\wo{$x$} is a true \wo{P} if and only if $x$ is P.\label{eq:Wx}}%\end{equation}The meaning of \wo{true friend} might thus seem no different from the meaning of\wo{friend} and this is probably what one would make out of it, if one were toconstruct any formal theory.\ftnt{The schema \refeq{eq:Wx} is, more or less,  the same as the basic case of the inductive definition of satisfaction for,  e.g., first-order logic.}But we are not after reducing anything to anything, and this schema is not fullysatisfying. \wo{True friend} can easily mean the opposite of what \wo{friend}happens to mean in a given situation, and then it can mean at least as manydifferent things as \wo{friend} can. We do not believe in any genuine, primary,\thi{true} meaning of a word, of which others would only be derivative oradultered versions. The genuine and inherent \co{vagueness} of \co{signs} wasdiscussed in I:\ref{sub:represent}.\refpf{pa:signsMean}.  Onerecognises, of course, the difference of accent and emphasis. Asprosententialism, or variants of deflationism might claim, \wo{true} functionsat best as a means of emphasis or indirect reference. However, the emphasis can amount to new \co{distinctions}: the increased need to emphasize thatthings are {\em truly} what they are, that \wo{$x$ is a {\em true} friend}, that\wo{$y$ is {\em truly} useful}, etc.  signals certain linguistic degeneration,one might say, deflation of the meaning of the words where, like in theOrwellian world, \wo{friend} no longer means what it truly means.\noo{If  \wo{true friend} meant the same as \wo{friend}, then one would better explain  why we sometimes use the one and sometimes the other expression. One should  then also have some problems with the meaning of \wo{false friend} but,  obviously, we do not have any.} On the other hand, even if \wo{true friend} tends to mean the same as\wo{friend}, so \wo{false friend} does not simply mean a non-friend.  A friendis false when, contrary to all appearances, contrary to all \co{signs}indicating and usually meaning friendship, he turns out not to be one.\noo{ Continuing in the vein of schema (\ref{eq:Wx}), one may observe that:  \equ{The word \wo{W} means W.\label{eq:Wmean}} This looks, if not  irresponsibly empty, so at least quite Wittgensteinian.  \citet{The limit of    language is shown by its being impossible to describe the fact which    corresponds to (is the translation of) a sentence, without simply repeating    the sentence.}{WittCultValue}{??? [The schema appears in    \citeauthor*{DummettM}, p.108 [Truth, p.343, footnote~37]]} Even if this  does not go for some words (which often can be explained), the point is the  same as above: the function \wo{the meaning of\ldots} (no longer a predicate)  can be used in exactly the same way, namely for disquotation, as the predicate  \thi{\ldots is true} -- explaining the {\em meaning of} \wo{W}, one explains  neither more nor less than W.\ftnt{With the minor, if occasionally    significant, difference that the word is taken in \la{suppositio formalis}    and not \la{materialis}.}  Most (modern) dealings with language happen at  the meta-level (higher-order) of \wo{\ldots} and one is deluded to believe  that such objects have any clearer and more manageable structure than the  repulsively mental \thi{\ldots}, or even more repulsively metaphysical  \ldots~. Unfortunately, except for the observations concerning the properties  of the mere signs and (im)possible distinctions in their uses, all the old  problems remain because all real questions involve immediately the  disquotation, that is, the return from \thi{what is \wo{truth}?}  to \thi{what    is true?}, from the meta-levels of the quotation marks to the object-level.  At the object-level, however, the relation to the extra-linguistic world is of  the primary importance. Even if we could not define it, make it \co{precise},  embrace it fully and exhaustively, we may still try to understand it. And if  we can not even understand it (through only some of its necessary conditions),  we need not claim that it does not exist. Such a conclusion is a pure  immanentism, as the case may be, reduction of the world to the language we use  to speak about it. But then, the mere use of the word \wo{truth} would prove  its reality.  }\pa\label{pa:truthAll} \co{Signs} are \co{actual} points terminating the\co{traces} of \co{transcendence}, \co{actual} expressions of thenon-\co{actual} and, eventually, \co{invisible distinctions}.  \co{Signs} whichwe usually do not consider to carry truth-value (because they do not expresspropositions? or even worse, because they are not declarative sentences?) can beconsidered true in the generous sense of drawing the \co{distinctions} inaccordance with the \co{rest} of relevant \co{distinctions}, whether \co{actual}or only \co{present}.  \wo{Please, close the door!} may be true -- with respectto the actual wishes ofthe one who pronounces it. Similarly, a question %, \wo{Is it raining outside?},normally suggests that the person asking it does not know, and canbe true with respect to this. Rhetorical question is exactly an untrue question,a non-question, which only appears as a question. In short, there is hardly anylinguistic \co{sign} which could not be endowed with the element of thetruth-value (which does not mean, that it must be its primary element). Buttruth is not restricted to linguistic \co{signs}. \citet{If you were in a place where you knew that there were both healthy and  poisonous herbs, though you did not know how to distinguish between them, butthere was someone else there whom you did not doubt knew how to distinguishthem, and when you asked him he told you which were the healthy and whichpoisonous, and he told you that some were healthy yet he himself ate others,which would you believe, his word or his deed?}{AnselmTruth}{9} His deed tellsthe truth which his words tried to hide. This could be easily misinterpreted as follows: what we consider as possiblytrue need not have the appearance of a proposition, but must be expressible as aproposition. If a question can be true, it is because it expresses also someproposition. \citet{It is easy to think of a language in which there is not a  form for questions, or commands, but questions and commands are expressed in  the form of statements, e.g., in forms corresponding to our \thi{I should like    to know if\ldots} and \thi{My wish is that\ldots}}{WFM}{Appendix  III:1\hee{???}}  So a command could be a joke or else a true command but thenthere is a corresponding proposition which is false, respectively true. If one insistedobsessively on this point, we might even let it pass but the problem is with thestatus of propositions, not to mention their actual content.% There are \co{acts} and attitudes which may be \co{recognised} as true without% us being able to specify which proposition would express their content.There is a much deeper sense -- than a mere rewriting of its meaning asa declarative sentence -- in which a command, and every \co{act} or\co{action}, can be true or untrue.  It can be true in the sense of being a goodcommand, a command which agrees with the human nature, a command the following of whichwill help one to realise one's true goal, a command which commands to do whatshould be done, in short, by agreeing not only with the \co{actually} givenfacts and observations but also with the deeper \co{distinctions} drawn acrossthe field of whole life.  One can certainly deny the very existence of such things, butsuch a denial will be rather only an expression of the uncertainty (or the lackof consensus) as to which particular commands are good and how they can possiblybe distinguished from the bad (false?) ones.  On the other hand, one might object thatthis is an illegitimate stretching of the meaning of the word \wo{true}. But such anaccusation starts from the assumption that only propositions, if not merelydeclarative sentences, can be true (or false) and this is exactly the assumptionwhich we do not share. In a deeper sense (to which we willreturn later) the truth-bearer is~\ldots \co{actuality}. Every \co{actual sign},every appearance (whether a friendly attitude, a command, a statement) makes adifference and hence carries an element of truth -- namely, truth with respectto a broader horizon of \co{distinctions}. \noo{For the present, we limit this generosity to the \co{reflective} (and  mostly linguistic) \co{signs}.  \noo{, i.e., those which are \co{dissociated      as signs}.}  }\subsubnonr{Truth and falsehood}\pa \co{Meaning}, we said in I:\refp{pa:signTrace}, is a \co{trace} of theprimordial \nexus\ of \co{signification}. It arises as a consequence of the\co{dissociation} of \co{sign} and signified giving rise to the abstract\co{signs} as opposed to \co{distinctions} they may signify. Emergence of\co{actuality} from the horizon of \co{experience} increases the \co{distance}-- the \co{distance} which separates one from the \co{origin} but also, in themost mundane form, the \co{distance} between the \co{actual signs} and the\co{actual} as well as \co{present} \co{distinctions}. \co{Sign} functions onlyin a context of usage but what makes it into a \co{sign} is the fact that itcarries its \co{meaning} -- the potential for drawing (particular)\co{distinctions} -- with it. This peculiarity of abstract \co{signs}, of\co{representations} as \co{reflective} doubles, dissolves the reactivecharacter of \oss\ and turns \co{representation} into an \co{act}, something notmerely conditioned by the \co{external} stimulus but involving also an elementof spontaneity.\noo{(Although conditioned by the higher levels, viewed from the  pure \co{immediacy} of the \co{act}, this spontaneity appears entirely  \co{subjective} and undetermined.)}Truth is now an adventure of meaning, of the \co{representations dissociated}from their origins and capable of actively effecting \co{distinctions}.Original \co{signs} are, in a sense, always true, for they are not dissociatedfrom their \co{meaning}. \co{Dissociated, reflective signs}, on the other hand,carry their own meanings, meanings which need not comply with the horizon of\co{distinctions} to which they are addressed.  Falsity (in any form, as amistake, misunderstanding, lie) is possible only as a result of\co{representation}, of the \co{dissociation} of \co{sign} (with its\co{meaning}) and the context of the addressed \co{distinctions}. Mostabstractly, falsity is a break, a mismatch between the \co{actual} and the\co{present} -- truth emerges as the desirable norm opposed to that.\co{Representations} can also address the \co{actual distinctions} and thusarises also the possibility of \co{representation} to disagree with the given\co{actuality}. Truth vs. falsity is a distinction within the sphere ofmeaning.\ftnt{We do not oppose the claim of Quine/Davidson's about the field  linguist's need to figure out beliefs and meanings of native speakers  simultaneously.\noo{after Rorty in TRUTH, p.333, ftnt.18} From such a  perspective divorcing truth from belief and belief from meaning may be  difficult. But we are not doing any linguistics, nor even any philosophy of  language. We only claim that in the generative order of \co{founding}, meaning  precedes truth. (Notice the following formulation: \citef{Suppose I think I    see a mouse disappear behind a chair. Clearly this belief could be mistaken.    But would this belief be wrong if I did not {\em truly believe} a mouse was    a small, four-footed mammal, or a chair an object made for    sitting?}{DavidsonEpistExt}{p.195} The emphasized phrase should probably  read \wo{mean}, though this would only support our point and not the argument  intending to show that any false belief requires a web of true ones. The  conclusion of the argument may be acceptable but it should not require  substitution of \thi{true beliefs} about mice for the meaning of the word  \wo{mouse}.) A child's world is full of \co{signs} (occurring only as the  \co{distinctions} which are their meanings) before some \co{dissociated signs}  turn out to be lies, or mistakes.\noo{(Truth (and falsity) are, of course,    much earlier phenomena than \co{attentively reflective} lies.)} Mistakes  occur against the background of accepted truths but also, and primordially,  against the background of meanings which, if they are \thi{true}, are so only  in a very special sense of the original \co{signs} which, not being  \co{dissociated} from their meaning, can not possibly be false.}  Lying is,from the point of view of the development of consciousness, a pretty advancedstage -- animals are not very cunning liars, even though they can sometimes bedeceitful.  Crying babies do not lie, crying youngsters and adults often do.\citet{A child has much to learn before it can pretend. (A dog cannot be a  hypocrite, but neither can he be sincere.)}{WittPI}{II:xi\kilde{p.194}} Theability to lie marks the transition past the level of the immediate truth of the\oss\ to their final, \co{reflective dissociation}, and the ability to lie in aconvincing and sophisticated way is \equi\ with an advanced system of\co{representations}.\pa Truth restores the unity disturbed by falsehood, and so the question aboutthe former presupposes clarification of the latter.  Truth as an explicit,\co{actual} phenomenon -- as a desirable norm -- enters the stage only asdistinguished from, in fact, as a consequence of the possible falsehood. It isthe possibility of an \co{actual sign} to mislead, to lie, to mean somethingwhich turns out to be different from what is the case, that is, to draw some\co{distinctions} in a way which does not conform to the \co{rest} of\co{distinctions} which are \co{present} (relevant) -- in short, it is thepossibility of mistake and failure -- which constitutes truth as the desirednorm. Thus, although truth as a fact, as the primordial \co{unity} is thebackground against which falsehood emerges as its violation, it is falsehoodwhich founds the truth as the \co{actual} norm.\ftnt{First failures of innocence  have the mood of disappointment with an unfaithful friend. One is disappointed  -- not by one's incapacity and failure (such \co{egotic} worries come later),  but by the world which deceived one.\noo{According to Lurianic Cabala,  \heb{<<shevirat ha-kelim>>}, \thi{breaking of the vessels}, is the second stage  of the world development, in which the divine light enclosed in the finite  vessels disperses as the vessels break under the strain, resulting in  disharmony and evil, which will now await for the final stage of  \heb{<<tiqqun>>}, \thi{restoration}.} } \noo{ Using (\ref{eq:truth}) as the  starting point, one might be tempted to say that S is false with respect to D  simply iff it is not true, i.e., iff $\mean S\not\subseteq D$.  But as we  emphasized, the pseudo-formal formulations must be taken with a lot of salt.  This relation would hold, for instance, when $\mean S\supset D$, and one would  rather not want that.\ftnt{So, if D are all the facts and observations for    which Newton's laws are true, then relativity theory, comprising more than    that, would be false with respect to this D. One may play futile games with    other possibilities, e.g., $\mean S \not= D$, $\mean S \cap D = \emptyset$,    etc.} We do not define falsehood on the basis of truth but rather the  opposite.  }%It is the \co{actuality} of falsehood, rather than of truth, whichgives rise to the \co{distinction} between the two. It is falsehood which is thecrucial \co{distinction} -- the \co{distinction} between the \co{meaning} of anabstract \co{sign} and the \co{distinctions} of the addressed background, the \co{distinction} whose possibility % does not obtain at the level of \co{signs} (coinciding with their meanings) and% which isappears first as a consequence of the \co{reflective dissociation}. %taking place with the \co{reflection} (Book I, \refpp{tripleDissoc}).  .\ad{Excluded Middle?}All \co{actuality} is a \co{sign}, and \co{signs} aretruth-bearers.\noo{, \refp{pa:truthAll}.} In a sense, one could therefore saythat, since every \co{actuality} is surrounded by the horizon of \co{presence} and hence can agree ordisagree with it, every \co{sign} is true or false and the scope of the\la{tertium non datur} is unlimited. But we would prefer to view truth as an explicit norm whicharises only against the possible falsehood. As long as such possibility does notarise, there is no need for truth or, as one could also say, truth is implicitlygranted. The fundamental claim is that truth is secondary in relation tomeaning, that \co{sign} is a \co{sign} in so far as it means something, as itmakes a difference by drawing a \co{distinction}, but it need not be true orfalse for that.\ftnt{\citef{What a picture represents it represents    independently of its truth or falsity, by means of its pictorial    form.}{Tract}{2.22}\noo{It should not be necessary to emphasize, that our  \co{signs} have little in common with Wittgenstein's \thi{pictures}.}}  Wetraced an aspect of truth even in commands and questions but typically themeaning of such \co{signs} overshadows the truth-aspect completely.\noo{ (simply  because the \co{signs} are, as a matter of fact, true).}Better examples aregiven by the traditional paradoxes. %\equu{(L)}{This sentence is false.}%The impossibility of assigning any truth-value to (L) has been declared aparadox. But this appears so only in the context of bivalent logic which insistson all statements having one of the only two truth-values.\noo{Even then one  introduces further distinctions to handle, for instance, open formulae which,  after all, are perfectly legal syntactic entities of the kind one might expect  to have a determined truth-value. But it may happen that neither such a  formula, $F(x)$, nor its (purely syntactically formed) negation, $\neg F(x)$,  has the value \thi{true} (or both have the value \thi{false}) which, if  nothing else, signals a special behaviour of negation with respect to  satisfaction, and consequently truth, of such formulae. We are not saying that  (L) is, formally, of a similar kind; only that just like truth-value of open  formulae is, even if formally unproblematic, so a bit undetermined (in the  sense that negation does not flip it), so may be the truth-value in natural  language of the statements like (L).} The additional identification of meaningwith truth-conditions forces then one to declare the statement meaningless. Butone can not meaningfully claim that it is meaningless, since one arrives at thisconclusion by analysing its truth-value as a function of~\ldots itsmeaning.\ftnt{If (L) is true, than {\em what it says} holds, but it {\em says    that}\ldots One might object that it is only the meaning of the components  of (L) which is known, while the whole statement fails to have one. But this  looks like splitting the hair. We do not combine arbitrarily the meanings of  \wo{false}, \wo{statement}, \wo{is}, \wo{this} but do it exactly according to  the rule specified by this statement. It is only this compound meaning of the  whole statement which causes the trouble with assigning to it any definite  truth-value.} We do not see any paradox here nor, for that matter, in Tarski's generalformulation of such phenomena, the undefinability theorem, stating that asemantically closed language can not obey the rules of classical logic.\ftnt{To  avoid technicalities, let us think of a semantically closed language simply  as one containing its own truth predicate and the self-referential  capacities. \thi{Classical logic} means here primarily two  truth-values.} The proof shows that such a language contains sentences which,like (L), do not have any well defined truth-value.  Why should it cause anyworries? Why should it be so that every statement must have exactly one of twopossible truth values? We know, in fact, that it is not so -- besides (L) andother paradoxes, there are other dubious cases like \wo{the sea-battle  tomorrow}, \wo{the current king of France who is bald}, etc. Various ways maybe designed to endow such statements with a truth-value, but they tend toover-interpret the intuitive meaning.  All the theorem says is that thetruth-value of (L) can not be determined in the world of boolean functionsworking (according to the classical rules) on the two standardtruth-values.\ftnt{Some newer and more inventive theories of truth no longer  insist on the bivalence and, instead, try to accommodate such phenomena, as is  done, for instance, in the revision theory of truth, where truth of a  statement is the fix-point of the appropriate unfolding of its meaning and  where some statements may simply not have such a fix-point. E.g., 1.~if (L) is  true, then it is false; 2.~if (L) is false, then it is true; 3.~if (L) is true,  then it is false; etc. -- the series does not converge to any definite  assignment of a unique truth-value to (L). \citeauthor*{GuptaRevisionA};  \citeauthor*{RevisionAB}; \citeauthor*{GuptaRevisionB}.}\noo{The D element takes care of this in that it relates truth of a statement to  the context of its application. \wo{My mother's name is Jenny} is neither true  nor false with respect to the universe of mathematics -- it is irrelevant.  Similarly, \wo{$\displaystyle{\sum_{x=1}^{x=n}x \not= \frac{n^2 - n}{2}}$} is  neither true nor false with respect to my family relations, but simply  irrelevant. This does not mean that any S may be turned true or false by  playing arbitrarily with the context D. As said in \refp{pa:notArbitraryD},  this context is more or less uniquely given by the meaning of the statement  (although some adjustments, narrowings or widenings may be needed in any  particular case).  }\pa\label{pa:fixedTruth} It is only the assumption that the world is a given andfixed \co{totality} of things or facts \thi{in themselves} which leads to theconviction that every sign (at least, proposition) is either true or false, andthat with the absolute -- that is unchangeable -- finality. The lack of such afinality does not mean relativism in the sense of subjective arbitrariness; itonly means that any particular truth can happen to be extended/adjusted/modfied,and that the \co{absolute} truth does not belong to such particulars but only tothe \co{absolute}.  \noo{ But, on the other hand, it makes most things true: the  armchair there is green, and this is as true as any such a statement can be;  Truth is a relation and hence is relative to {\em both} its arguments; but  such relativity does not mean subjectivity nor arbitrariness; only  non-finality, non-fixity, non-absoluteness...  }The absence of precise bivalence and the limitations of the principle ofexcluded middle go even further: truth, and hence also falsehood, is a matter ofdegree.  Saying that \wo{$x$ is blue} about an $x$ which is pink is triviallyfalse.  Is saying that \wo{$x$ is blue} about an $x$ which is dark blue true?Yes, if darkness does not matter. And no if it does. But when it is not true, isit false? Perhaps, perhaps only to a degree.  A half-truth is often a falsehoodbut, then, it is also a half-{\em truth}.  Proliferation of various theories offuzzy sets and fuzzy truth, of vague and probabilistic variants of the notionstreated traditionally as rigid distinctions, witnesses to the changingunderstanding of these notions.  Truth, admitting of degrees, is not simplyopposed to falsehood which, too, is a matter of degrees. They are opposite butthe opposition is not a pure, univocal bivalence. Just like most \co{acts} areneither good nor evil, so most \co{actual signs} are neither true nor false.There is a large grey zone between the two extremes, and \co{signs} falling inthis zone may often be declared true {\em and} false or, as the case or wish maybe, as neither.\subsubnonr{Truth}     \pa\label{pa:notArbitraryD} Truth is a possible property of \co{actuality} and,consequently, also of the \co{actual signs} and their linguistic expressions. It is arelation between two (sets of) \co{distinctions}: the truth-bearing \co{actual  signs} and the truth-giving (\co{actual} or not) \co{distinctions}. Denotingthe former by S and the latter by D, \wo{S is true} means \wo{S is true with respect to D}.  Frege's objection (actually, to thecorrespondence theory, which here can be extended to D), that truth cannotconsist in a relation for this \citet{is contradicted by the use of the word  \wo{true}, which is not a relation-word and contains no reference to anything  else to which something must correspond}{FregeTruth}{} is a funny example ofthe strange assumption that language, and in fact already its common usage,contains all and only truth.\ftnt{There are few traces of the relative motion in  ordinary language use, so that claiming that trees along the alley actually  move as I am walking would be not only unnatural but {\em actually    contradicted} by the {\em usage} of the word \wo{move}.}  D is hardly ever mentionedexplicitly because it is determined by the \co{shared} background ofcommunication, by the context of discourse.%We mentioned the possible disagreement between the \co{represented} and given\co{actuality}. The \co{distance} between the two can be seen as the differencebetween S and D, when not only the former but also the latter involves(primarily) only \co{actual distinctions}.  Saying \wo{It is sunny}, we do notspecify \wo{at present, at the place where we are talking, with respect to the  actually observed weather conditions, etc.}  -- all such indexicals areimplicitly given. Saying \wo{Life is a disappointment}, we do not specify thatwe do not mean \thi{at present, at the place where we are talking, etc.}  Inpractice, D is usually fully transparent, given implicitly by the {meaning} of Sand the situation.\ftnt{This {meaning} involves what Austin calls the  \citef{demonstrative conventions}{Austin}{} correlating the words with the  actual, historic situation in the world. But likewise, it involves also  indications that some words are not to be so correlated. All such relations  and correlations are aspects of \co{meaning} in our generous sense of all the  drawn \co{distinctions}.} Thus, not only context disambiguates the meaning butalso vice versa, meaning narrows the context of interpretation -- the two are\co{aspects} of one \nexus.The \co{meaning} of S is some set of \co{distinctions} which itself constitutesa part of the world and hence this \co{meaning} is by its very nature woven intothe texture of the world, into the \co{rest} of the \co{present distinctions}.The statement \wo{It is sunny} draws some \co{distinctions} in the actualsituation and these are related to other \co{distinctions}, for instance, tothose which we can drawn by looking around or by (not) feeling raindrops on thehead.  The meaning of \wo{Life is a disappointment} draws some \co{distinctions}in the actual situation: perhaps, it is a general statement about life, perhaps,only an expression of the depressive period in one's life, perhaps, only asarcastic comment on the train of somebody else's complains. The \co{vagueness}of the statement amounts to indeterminacy of meaning which, in extreme cases,can make search for its truth futile. But even without any \co{clearer}indications, one will recognise in such a statement an expression of some\co{quality} which may seem more or less in agreement with one's ownunderstanding of life. The \co{distinctions} (D) implied by the meaning of thestatement are completely different from the previous case, but the truth of bothhas the same general form of agreement between the respective sets of\co{distinctions}.% \pa% Truth-conditionalists (as also later truth-verificationists) tried to reduce% meaning to truth under the assumption that truth is either something simpler or% more primitive than meaning. We agree that truth is something much simpler than% meaning, but it is not more primitive. It is simpler because it assumes more and% hence its intrinsic nature (what distinguishes it from the relevant opposite:% falsehood) is simple. By the same token, it is less primitive because what it% assumes is exactly the more primitive \nexus\ of meaning.\pa\label{pa:truth}The question about the nature of truth reduces almost to the question aboutmeaning; it \citet{depends on just two things: what the words as spoken mean,  and how the world is arranged.}{DavidsonCoherence}{p.139} The crucial issueconcerns, of course, this last phrase. In our case, \thi{the way the world is  arranged} corresponds, in every particular situation, to some more\co{distinctions}, or else to some \co{distinctions} made by other means thanthe (linguistic) \co{signs} whose truth is under the question. Veryschematically, we can express the required relation between S and D as follows:%\equ{S is true with respect to D iff $\mean S \subseteq \mbox{D}$\label{eq:truth}}%i.e., a \co{sign} (a collection thereof, an \co{actuality}) S is true withrespect to D iff it means/makes only \co{distinctions} made in D.\ftnt{As a  curio: this can be reformulated so that every truth comes out as an identity,  for instance,\noo{using Boole's $\nu$D for `a subset of D', and writing $\mean    S=\nu$D, or in a more modern form,} using the equivalent formulation of the  subset relation: $\mean S\cup D = D$.  Of course, we use this pseudo-formalism  merely as a symbolic abbreviation. It may be helpful, but $\subseteq$ may  equally well be replaced by some other form of \thi{fitting} or  \thi{conformity}.  We do not intend any formally \co{precise} theory of  anything.}\paThe relativity to D certainly will not lead us to any relativism orscepticism. But it is not only apparent. Truth of a \co{sign} depends on theobject it addresses; truths about relative beings are, by this very fact,relative, while \co{absolute} truth can only concern the \co{absolute}.% In practice, D is almost never specified explicitly, let alone voluntarily, but% is determined by the meaning of S. It may vary changing the truth-value of a% given statement.\ftnt{The meaning of S can, of course, depend on the actual%   situation, context of conversation and what not. Varying D reflects this%   possibility.}The stick lying at the bottom of a river is more like a snake, bending, swingingand swaying, drawn half-way out of the water it is bent, and drawn completelyout it is straight.  Descartes concludes that our sense-perceptions delude us(at least in the first two cases) and can not be trusted. It remains unclear whythey delude us in the two former cases but not in the last one, and theparticularly suspicious minds keep playing the games of total illusion, brainsin the vats, and the like. It rather seems that our senses are equallytruthful in all three cases: in the first two what we see is true with respectto the visual distinctions (to put it blatantly: what we see is what we see, andthere is no falsity about it); in the third case, what we see is true also withrespect to other \co{distinctions}, say, those made by the sense of touch and,for that matter, our knowledge that the stick remains unaffected by the way anyparticular person might see it.\ftnt{The point expressed traditionally by saying  that truth is not the matter of perception but of judgment, e.g., \citef{truth    or falsity seems to me to be in opinion rather than in the senses. For if    the inner sense is deceived, the exterior does not lie to it.  [...] This is    the case when someone similar to someone else is thought to be him, or when    hearing something other than human voice we think it to be a human voice.    But it is the interior sense that does this. [...] So it happens that    interior sense imputes its mistake to the exterior sense.}{AnselmTruth}{6}  \citef{It is therefore correct to say that the senses do not err -- not    because they always judge rightly but because they do not judge at    all.}{CrPR}{I:2nd Division.Introduction.1;A293/B350} Judgment was supposed  to relate to the ultimate sphere against which all particular cases were to be  judged, while we have replaced this sphere with D.}The relativity to D is the common feature of truth theories which differprimarily with respect to what they consider to be the relevant D.\ftnt{D  appears, in one form or another, in all explicit models: for instance, in  formal model theory, as the actual structure (perhaps, with the assignments to  the free variables) in which the truth of the formula S is evaluated; in  situation semantics of Barwise and Perry, as the situation addressed by the  utterance, in Kripke semantics for modal logic as the actual world, among all  possible ones, etc., etc.  But we do not study formal theories.}  The schema\refeq{eq:truth} contains the abstracted elements involved in most discussionsof truth and thus allows us also to see some of the differences between variousapproaches. For instance:\begin{itemize}\itemTruth-conditionalism uses the same formula but to define $\mean\_$ and nottruth. Instead of assuming given $\mean\_$, it takes as fixed D (the world,totality of facts, or the like) and the understanding of the left hand side. Thetruth-condition, corresponding to the subset inclusion, amounts then to adefinition of the meaning function $\mean\_$.  \item  Correspondence theories take D (and hence also the target of$\mean\_$) to be the external world. (How this is to be understood is anothermatter.) \item  Deflationists take D to be the whole universe (i.e., make any inclusion in Dtrivial, which amounts to removing D), and let $\mean\_$ simply remove thequotation marks around S.\item  Coherence theories also fix D but take it to be some set of accepted beliefs.\item  Pragmatists would like D to be some ideal, eventual conditions to be judged asdesirable (or, perhaps, just that which will remain \thi{there in the end}(let us not ask where \thi{there} is and when \thi{the end} might be)), with$\mean\_$ assigning to its argument the outcome of actions done in accordancewith it. \end{itemize}It is impossible to dissociate the discussion of truth from ontology.  Thedifferences above concern the understanding of the reference frame D. With thelatter theories (coherentism, pragmatism) it is not, perhaps, ontology in theusual sense, yet it acquires the fundamental meaning for the theory {\em because}it functions as the measure of truth, as the element of a transcendent character,if not as the transcendence itself.  A critique of some theory of truth amountsusually to a critique of this frame, of the presupposed (or implied)ontology. In the following, we will distinguish the kinds of truthdepending on D, on the addressed level of \co{distinctions}. But first one final remark.%\ad{Not whole truth, various truth}\pa Truth is a \co{trace} of \co{transcendence} surrounding the \co{immanence}of the \co{actual signs} and the reference frame D can vary according to thepossible variations in the scope of \co{transcendence}. Something can beconsidered true with respect to: the actual situation, some given set ofobservations and experiments, the life experience, the (un)imaginable\co{totality} of all \co{distinctions}.  Consequently, truth admits of degreesand a statement true about the factual appearances can be false with respect toother dimensions. But although D may vary as much as S, it is the same schema\refeq{eq:truth} from \refp{pa:truth} which governs the relation at everyparticular level.  Only having fixed D, one can possibly speak about {\em the}truth. One could then imagine the equality S=D as the ultimate truth (about D),while every partial truth about D as its proper subset. We could also havedisjoint S1 and S2, both true with respect to D -- completely different truthsabout the same.  Also, triviality is possible only when D is fixed or, as we canalso say, when some things are obvious. Triviality is something which makes nodifference, not an S with empty meaning (every triviality means something)% (such that $\meant S{$\emptyset$}$).\noo{One should always be wary of misuse of%   mathematical concepts and symbols....} It has a meaning, only that thisbut an S with meaning which in no way contributes to the actual D -- it onlyrepeats some already obvious \co{distinctions}.\noo{As one has observed an  invention of a plethora of discourses -- like \thi{moral discourse},  \thi{aesthetic discourse}, \thi{rational discourse}, etc. -- we should make  clear that unable to discern much sense behind them, we mean by \wo{discourse}  simply any particular situation (or as the case may be, a lasting  relationship) in which some concrete people communicate by any means  whatsoever. It may be hard to imagine a situation involving at least two  persons which is not a discourse: \co{sharing} the situation is already a  communication, involving a lot of common knowledge.}In a particular situation, it is often much more important and difficult toagree on which aspects to consider relevant, than on the content of each aspect,it is more difficult to agree on D than on S. This is only a local reflection ofthe more general fact, namely, that even the most stubborn realists have notmanaged to come up with a convincing model of the world, of the ultimate D which could(should and would) serve as the constant measure of truth,\refp{pa:fixedTruth}. The world we live in is the world of \co{distinctions}which we are able and forced to recognise. %This harbours some Now, the more \co{distinctions} D, the more (possible) truths but also, by thesame token, the more falsehoods.\ftnt{If such observations were of relevance,  one could point that, according to \refp{pa:truth}.\refeq{eq:truth}, the  number of truths grows, their triviality notwithstanding, exponentially with  the number of \co{distinctions}.} \woo{One is certain of one's knowledge only  when one knows little; doubts increase with knowledge.}{Goethe\kilde{Blad    tkwi...,p.56}} There is probably some limit beyond which moredifferentiation, needed as it may seem in the search for further knowledge,breeds only more confusion and idle dispute, where \citeti{every solution to a  problem is a new problem,}{Goethe}{\kilde{p.55}} where every new step,multiplying the truths, or rather only probabilities and possibilities oftruths, removes us from the truth. Saying too much (thirst for \co{precision}shares at least that much with its frequent companion -- the fear of triviality)is more often than not a violation of the truth. The true art is not only toknow what can be said but, primarily, to know what can not and therefore shouldnot even be asked for. \citet{And it is no easie matter, being in the midst of  the cariere of a discourse, to stop cunningly, to make sudden period, and to  cut it off.

Or so, at least, it seems. We have saidwhat such ideal \co{totalities} are good for, but we will return to this, aswell as to the question about the \co{absolute} truth, discussing the levels oftruth below.%\refpf{pa:levelAtruth}. \subsubnonr{The levels of truth}%Truth-bearer is \co{actuality} or, in a bit more specific sense, the \co{actual  signs}.  Truth is a \co{trace} of \co{transcendence} reflecting the anchoringof these in the wider reality. What is taken as this \thi{wider reality}determines the understanding, if not a detailed theory, of truth.  The level, ordepth, of a truth reflects only the level addressed by the \co{signs}, whichcorresponds to D in the schema \refp{pa:truth}.\refeq{eq:truth}.\ad{\imm The immediate truth}\label{pa:levelAtruth}\label{pa:immedSubject}% At the lowest level of \co{immediacy}, the \co{sign} simply coincides with the% signified. Sensation, if not also perception, can always be taken as true with respect toitself, and this is the way of immanent truth taken by sensualism orphenomenalism, whether of empirical or idealistic flavour. Every sensation istrue with respect to the fact of its occurrence.  In fact, every \co{sign} istrue if taken only with respect to the trivial \co{distinction} of its merebeing given: it makes a difference whether \wo{qukkda} is given here or not. Itis, however, such a trivial and irrelevant difference that one will hardly evertake it into account. We are, after all, not interested in mere \co{immediacy}but in what it means.The rationalistic variant of this level of truth takes into account not only thetrivial coincidence of the \co{immediate signs} and their meanings but thepossible \co{distance} between meanings of abstract \co{signs} and the addressedreality. It appeals to \co{immediate} ideas which appear as self-evident, thatis, unconditionally true.\ftnt{Truth becoming mere certainty is a constant  aspect of this reduction, which starts perhaps with Descartes' postulate  \citef{never to accept anything for true which I did not clearly know to be    such [...] and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was    presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of    doubt.}{DesMethod}{II\kilde{p.22}} Later, it accompanies verificationism and  coherentism alike. \citef{All you have any dealings with are your doubts and    beliefs [...]  Now that which you do not at all doubt, you must and do    regard as infallible, absolute truth.}{WhatisPragm}{p.188-9}\noo{Doubt,    belief indicate, if not prove, the focus on \co{reflective} attitude.}}\noo{  In a more elaborate form, one can bring in the abstract \co{signs} and  caricature the idea as claiming that \wo{blue} is true when related to a  sensation of blueness. The verbal \co{distinction} relates to the visual  \co{distinctions}.  It is not the abstract \co{sign} which coincides with its  meaning, but the meaning of this \co{sign} coincides fully with the addressed  \co{distinction}.  (In terms of the schema \refp{pa:truth}.\refeq{eq:truth},  we have S $\not=\mean S$, but $\meant SD$.)} We will not repeat here theremarks on idealized \co{immediacy} from \ref{sub:idealImmed} (in particular,\refpf{pa:DescartesKnow}), but only notice again that, all the differencesnotwithstanding, phenomenalism and rationalism join the ranks in so far as theinfallibility of the truth they are searching for is found in the\co{immediacy}, whether of sensations or self-evidence.%of a \co{sign} coinciding with its \co{meaning}.In either case, the reductionto \co{immediacy} means reduction to pure \co{subjectivity}. This conclusion was notnecessarily drawn by the proponents of the respective ideas, but as theunderstanding of truth it amounts to solipsism:  the whole truth is the pure\co{immediacy}, that is, pure \co{subjectivity}.%-- with its sensations, impressions, ideas -- is.\pa But truth is a \co{trace} of the ultimate  \co{unity} and hence it carries withinitself the sense of \co{transcendence} which is impossible to dissolve in anysubjectivistic reductions. Truth can hardly be dissociated from ontology.%In a strange way (or perhaps not so strange, after all)Cartesian ultimate certainty, \la{Cogito ergo sum}, places itself in the\co{immediate subjectivity}: the point of self-evidence which, however, unlessaugmented by God with some additional insights, would leave one in the perfectself-satisfaction (or shall we rather say, despair?) of a solipsist. Exactly thesame threat appears to Philonous who, having reduced the existence (and truth)to being \co{immediately} perceived, has to invoke higher consciousness toensure any {\em real} existence and truth.\ftnt{\citeauthor*{BerkeleyDial}{,    II}}To avoid solipsism one has to give up the limitation to the irrefutability of  the \co{immediate signs} and admit some \co{distance}. As we have seen, the \co{objective aspect} of this level, its ontology (if we may misuse the term), is a disappearing point, an\co{immediate, external object}. Supported by all the common-sense one caninvoke, truth becomes thus correspondence of the \co{immediate, subjective  sign} and the equally \co{immediate} but \co{external object}. Thisconceptionhas been dominating since Aristotle's famous:\citet{To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false,while to say of what is that it is, or of what is not that it is not, istrue.}{AristMeta}{IV:7\kilde{$\Gamma$:7.27}} We won't analyse it in all possibleaspects, but want to show its association with the principle declared by much ofthe tradition to be the fundamental \thi{law of thought}, if not also of\thi{being}. % \tpa{The logical aspect. }\ftnt{We will indicate how some aspects of understanding truth along%   various levels can provide motivation for analogous distinctions within%   formal logic.%   The most crucial aspect seems to be the meaning%   one attaches to negation, and we will consider some extra-mathematical%   features which find their expression in various properties of -- or at%   least the role played by -- negation. Of course, we do not address any points%   of strictly mathematical or formally-logical nature.}\pa\label{pa:logicA} \citetib{[I]t is impossible for anything at the same time  to be and not to be.}{AristMeta}{IV:4} Indeed, the \co{objects}, theself-identical, indivisible \thi{substances}, solidified complete notions whosereality is consummated in the \co{immediate} limit of \co{actuality} make theprinciple of contradiction most natural and obvious.  The condition \thi{at the  same time} is decisive and it is this condition which narrows the horizon ofattention to pure \co{immediacy}, the ideality of extensionless \thi{now}.Within so narrow a scope of the \hoa, an \co{object} can not both be and not-be,and as it is assumed to possess only equally \co{immediate} properties, it cannot both be-so and not-be-so.Let's also notice that, although the principle is stated few lines earlier in amore epistemological terms, \wo{it is impossible for the same man at the same  time to believe the same thing to be and not to be}, it is immediately turnedinto an ontological principle.  In search for infallible and \co{visible}certainty, not only understanding and \co{reflective} knowledge, but also beingget reduced to the pure \co{immediacy}.%\pa\label{pa:immedNexus}But what is this, apparently so obvious, \thi{at the same time}? An $x$ can notbe simultaneously black and not black. OK, but the whole issue is this\thi{simultaneity}. It is not even some imagined \thi{least possible passage of  time}, but a residual and timeless point of immediacy. If I see an objecthaving and not having a property (or being and not being), I \thi{know} thatsome passage of time must have been involved. (An alternative way of dissolvingthe contradiction would be to postulate different objects.) We do not deal herewith a fundamental principle -- of non-contradiction -- but with a \nexus\ ofwhich this principle is only an \co{aspect}. Simultaneity, taken for granted inthe above formulation, is needed to obtain the principle but, equally well, theprinciple itself can serve as the basis for \thi{defining} simultaneity -- asthe limit of differentiation, as the limit excluding any possible contradiction.Such a temporal limit coincides with the imagined space point; each is only the\co{posited} residuum of the respective dimension. This spatio-temporal residuumis, in turn, an image of the absolutely self-identical \co{object}, the idealsubstance. Thus to this ideal limit of \co{reflection} addressed in\ref{sub:idealImmed} -- the \nexus\ of \co{immediacy}, space-time point,substantiality -- we can now add also the principle of non-contradiction.\noo{  (and soon will also add necessity).}The associated law of excluded middle expresses then the completeness of thenotion, of a \thi{substance} which is \co{precise} and definite. In the narrowscope of \co{immediacy} it must either be or not-be, and for any equally\co{immediate} property, it must either be-so or not-be-so.  This also expressesthe absolute character of negation, as the \co{reflection that it is} isolatesabsolutely its \co{object} excluding everything else from the \co{actuality} of\co{reflection}.  Indeed, with respect to the \co{immediacy} of an \co{act}, an\co{object} has only two possibilities of either being here or not being here.This narrowing of being to the ideal point constitutes the bivalent\co{precision} of \thi{yes} vs. \thi{no}, \thi{being} vs. \thi{not-being}, andunderlies the bivalence of truth and falsehood posited as an equally\co{precise} opposition.\noo{Spinoza's \la{omnis determinatio est negatio}, even if it was meant to  point in the direction of unlimited substance, describes excellently the  origin of negation which results from the isolation of \co{objects} into the  horizon of \co{reflective immediacy}.  }%\newpa  \ad{\act The actual truth}\label{pa:truthB}%\act $P_{1}\lor P_{2}\lor P_{3}\lor\ldots$ \\The above correspondence theory, arising from the \co{subject}-\co{object}\co{dissociation}, applies equally at the level of \co{actuality}. An \co{actual  complex} underlies the idea of the \thi{fact} or \thi{state of affairs}, asthese arise in variants of the correspondence theory. This is the scope withinwhich all indisputable trivialities of the kind \wo{Snow is white}, \wo{The cat  is on the mat}, etc.  have their \la{locus} -- both expression andconfirmation. Consequently, it is from this sphere that correspondence theoristsfetch all their \thi{obvious} examples.Although emerging directly from the assumed ontology of \co{objects}, the truthbecomes a bit more multifacet than the contradiction of \thi{yes} and \thi{no}.Negation does not any longer have the absolute and determinate character.  It isno longer the mere binary \thi{yes} or \thi{no}, the bivalent contradiction, buta mulitfacet \co{complex} of contraries.  A thing can be blue or green or redor\ldots Various predicates do not stand to each other in relation ofcontradiction, yet they may exclude each other.  For a property $P$, theabsolute negation not-$P$ becomes less informative -- it can be now taken onlyas an abbreviation for an extensive, perhaps even infinite, alternative of allits contrary properties.\ftnt{The logic still retains the laws of  non-contradiction and of excluded middle, but its extra-logical character  changes by de-emphasizing the role of negation and bringing forth the positive  alternative of contraries.  As one example (of a multitude of logical systems  which formally capture this transition) one can mention logics of finite  observations -- pointfree topology, theory of locales -- which develop this  idea by allowing one to define more advanced, lattice-like structures of  disjunctions/conjunctions of positive concepts where negation, if present at  all, is only of secondary importance.\noo{e.g., S.~Vickers, ``Topology via    logic''.}\label{ftnt:locales}}\pa The \co{horizontal transcendence} of this level is \co{more} of\co{complexes}, and the search for truth keeps multiplying the analysed facts,phenomena and truths about them.  Truth of a theory is the issue of this levelwhich, as has been observed, is in general  irreducible to the truth ofits empirically observable consequences. The question of the degree of truth, orcomparison of two theories, becomes of interest and the truth of a theoryseems to be of a different kind than the truth of a single statement.  Variousapproaches, even if severely distinct in conceptual constructions, seemnevertheless to be always variations over the pragmatic concept of truth. For wehave seen better -- more true? -- theories replacing the worse ones.  As Newtonsuperseded Aristotle, as Einstein superseded Newton, so progress seems tobelong to the notion of (such a) truth. But like every declaration of progress-- either it is only a reflection of a prior ideal goal or else createsimmediately the question about such a goal.  Unless one feels satisfied with amerely sociological account of the fact of {\em acceptance} of one theoryinstead of another, one should somewhat account for the primacyof some theories over others.%  -- [CORRESPONDENCE/absolutised:OBJECTIVISM (obj.illusion)...]The changeable nature of most formulations and theories accepted as true,combined with the image of absolute and unchangeable truth, lead to the truth asthe  ideal goal, truth as a regulative idea.\ftnt{This is, in fact, inherent in  the very questions \wo{How?} and \wo{Why?} asking for an explanation. They arepossible only on the prior assumption that things are {\em not} what theyappear, that every encounter has some hidden essence (whether cause, goal orstructure). This (we could say, transcendental assumption) turns the discoveredsolution of one problem into a new problem because it, too, is only anappearance in need of a new explanation. The postulated infinity of the processof explanation is only a reflection of turning this  \co{dissociation} ofthings from their meaning into the image of absolute, eventually-to-be-reached truth.}  Pierce: \citet{experience shows that the calm and  careful consideration of the same distinctly conceived premises (including  prejudices) will insure the pronouncement of the same judgment by all  men.}{PierceFourIncap}{} It is very, very uncertain if experience really showsanything of this kind. But even if it did, ofwhat concern could it be to me or to you, to any concrete human being?  Everything \citet{which will be thought to   exist in the final opinion is real, and nothing else.}{PierceBerkeley}{p.82}How long shall we wait to see what is real?  The essential questions concerning{when} such a common pronouncement can be obtained and how could we possiblyknow that it has been obtained (and won't be challenged any more) are not only  open but also impossible to close. (All forms of eschatology are nothing but  calls to the infinite waiting for the historical end of times.) Most  unfortunately, however, such totalitarian futurologies forget almost everything. I am sitting now in the sunshine eating a tastyice-cream. It is extremely real, as real as the heat of the sun, but I doubtanybody will ever, ultimately, on the day of settling the accounts, care todevote any thoughts to this fact. Whether anybody would or not, its reality\la{hic et nunc} is completely independent from what such a committee of mindsmight eventually decide.\pa The \co{horizontal transcendence} of \co{actuality} is \co{more} of\co{objects} and \co{actualities}, and dissatisfaction with the correspondencetheories refers to this aspect. First come the trivial questions. Where is the\co{precise} distinction between \co{sign} and signified, between meaning andwhat is meant? Nobody ever gave a rigid, \co{precise} definition of it, and some feeljustified to conclude that there is therefore no distinction.There is also a mightier argument with which Berkeley might seem to havediscredited even the mere possibility of maintaining correspondence.  For  \citet{so long men thought [...\noo{that real things subsisted without the      mind, and}] that their knowledge was only so far forth real as it was    conformable to real things, it follows they {\em could not be certain} they    had any real knowledge at all.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{\para 86 [my emph.]}  \citet{How given that we \thi{cannot get outside our beliefs and our language      so as to find some test other than coherence} we nevertheless can have    knowledge of, and talk about, an objective public world which is not of our    making?}{DavidsonCoherence}{p.141}\noo{We are not concerned    here with Davidson at all, according to whom coherence is only a criterion    ensuring correspondence.}%  Since we indeed \citet{\noo{we}cannot compare belief with non-belief to see if    they match,}{RortyPDT}{p.334} then let us better reduce truth to some form  of its corroboration which, at least in principle, should be possible  \thi{inside} our beliefs.  Thus, one seems forced to replace truth with  the corroboration of truth.\ftnt{Deflationism being the most recent and  extreme form of such a reduction.}  A \thi{fact} gets reduced to the  criteria of its verification, to its pragmatic utility, to coherence with  accepted truths, to a consensus within a community, or what not. The more  radical representatives claim that the criteria or characteristics they arrive  at actually {\em are} the concept of truth, while the more sober ones admit  that establishing acceptable criteria of truth need not necessarily require or  imply the grasp of the concept of truth itself.%\pa%Wittgenstein?? & coherentismThe general scheme of the critique is similar, technical and more particulardifferences notwithstanding: what is a complex theory (not a single statementbut a {\em set} thereof; perhaps just a highly structured description) supposedto correspond to? Also all the \thi{entities} like negations or disjunctionsseem to reside only \thi{in the mind}; they seem to have no simply \co{visible} correlates in the \thi{reality outside}, thecorrespondence to which would constitute their truth.\ftnt{Objections of the same kind, but of more specific forms, concern the  ontological assumptions frequently associated with (a variant of)  correspondence theory. One would say that true statement corresponds to a  fact, or a state of affairs, or something that actually obtains in reality.  The problem is to clarify the understanding of such entities -- what exactly  is a fact? (We won't follow the lengthy debates                                %, like that between Austin and Strawson,  whether \thi{facts} are something \thi{in the world} at all. It often seems  that attempts to distance oneself from philosophy end  in bad  philosophy rather than outside it.) If \thi{the cat on the mat} is a fact, then is it  also the fact that \thi{there is no cat on the mat}?  What kind of (objective!  external!) fact is that? There seems to be no satisfying answer from the  proponents of the ontology of facts, but we would not take it as a successful  critique of the correspondence theory.  If \thi{mental} vs.  \thi{outside    reality} has any significant meaning, and any meaning for the theory of  truth, then what with the statements like \wo{I love her.}? One may attempt  behavioristic reductions but most would probably agree that if it is true then  the fact, if any, to which it corresponds is pretty \thi{mental}. Certainly,  for the one who is making the statement, it is in no way external.}But such a critique (motivating idealistic coherentism or, most generally,immanentism) seems to rest on some all too strong, if not directly wrong,assumption. The assumption amounts to absolutisation of the dualism: the\thi{objective public world} is \thi{out there} and we are trying to reach itfrom some \thi{closed inside} -- not just a duality, presence of two distinctaspects, but an absolute dualism. The world and the mind(or language) are posited as totally incommensurable entities which, by theinitial and all underlying assumption {\em are not} and {\em can not} come intocontact with each other. As this makes the conflict indissoluble, the only thingwhich remains is to get rid of one of the elements. Mind (or language) muststay, as it is doing all the consideration, so the only element which can goaway is the extra-mental, or extra-linguistic reality. This form of idealism has beenthe background for the coherentism from its beginnings with Bradley andJoachim.\ftnt{If not with Berkeley. Statements like, e.g., \citef{It is a hard    thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end    in consequences which cannot be maintained or made    consistent.}{BerkeleyPrinc}{Introduction \para 3} may not announce a  full-fledged coherence theory of truth, but they signal the presence of its  essential elements.}Of course, you cannot both lock the box and have it open. But who has said that thebox is locked, that language does not refer to anything extra-linguistic, thatmind is able to relate only to itself? This, as we said, is motivatedexclusively by the immanentism, the wish to account for everything in the\co{visible} categories and, in the present context of truth, to reduce it tothe \co{visible} criteria of its verification.  The argument is simply this: saying that truth is arelation of language to the world, we remain \thi{within} thelanguage. But do we really? If I hear that\equl{\wo{There is a funny guy on  the square.}\label{eq:rel}}I convince myself about the truth of this statement by lookingout the window -- not very linguistic act and certainly not one keeping me\thi{inside} the \co{actuality} of my solipsistic \thi{mind}.We have -- we {\em do have} -- the relation between the linguistic expressions andthe world (or between S and D), something like:\equl{\ \xymatrix{\txt{\wo{There is a funny guy on  the square.}}    \ar@{<->}[rr]^>>>>>>>>>>r && \txt{{the funny guy on the square}}}\label{eq:relF}}%Now, applying \refeq{equ:bicond} from \refp{pa:whatcanbetrue} and saying that\equl{\wo{To  check if \wo{There is a funny guy on the square} is true I have to look at the  square.}\label{eq:relrel}}%is indeed a linguistic expression which, in a sense, has turned \thi{is true}into a higher-order predicate, has \thi{internalised} the $r$ from\refeq{eq:relF}. As Tarski saw, natural language contains its own meta-languageand is semantically closed but this is only an impediment in rendering such alanguage in purely formal terms of a mathematical theory. If one does not aim atsuch reductions, this fact can be seen exactly as the source of the power whichnatural language draws from the contact with its \thi{outside}, from the factthat, unlike any formal language (or for that matter any language when raised tothe level of the only and exclusive object of study), it is not an isolated and\co{dissociated} entity existing exclusively according to its own definition andnorms but, on the contrary, that it is only an \co{aspect} of \co{existence}involved into its world.  Just like the universal possibility of {objectifying}anything leads to the \co{objectivistic illusion}, so the universal possibilityof such an \thi{internalisation}, the mere fact of the relation \refeq{eq:relF}being expressed linguistically as \refeq{eq:relrel}, can be misused for reducingeverything to a mere linguistic expression.  But just like the \co{objectivistic  illusion} amounts to forgetting almost the whole sphere of \co{existential}meaningfulness, so this reduction is possible only if one forgets that\refeq{eq:relrel} is only a \co{reflection} of \refeq{eq:relF}.  All suchlinguistic (or mental) reductions forget exactly this first fact, the originalrelation \refeq{eq:relF}, and dwell exclusively at its \co{reflection}\refeq{eq:relrel}, the mere \co{signs} over which they do have some power. Buttruth is not the same as its expression or criteria and \citet{the thing  [statement] which is true can be know before its truth is  known.}{ScotOrdinatio}{I:d3.q4\noo{p.99}}%As pointed earlier, \refeq{eq:Wmean} p.\pageref{eq:Wmean},\citet{The limit of language is shown by its being impossible to describe the  fact which corresponds to (is the translation of) a sentence, without simply  repeating the sentence.}{WittCultValue}{\hee{???.} Or else, extending the  schema \refp{pa:whatcanbetrue}.\refeq{eq:Wx}: the meaning of \wo{W} is W, as  observed, e.g., in \citeauthor*{DummettM}, p.108\kilde{[Truth, p.343,    footnote~37]}} Wrong assumptions lead often to right conclusions, just likeright observations can be used to justify wrong conclusions.  This veryobservation seems to underlie two opposite views.  On the one hand, language cannot be explained by anything extra linguistic, because every such explanationremains within the language. Limit, if there is any, is only an internal limitof the language itself, and it provides the only constraint on its meaning and,eventually, truth.  Certainly \wo{reality}, \wo{extra-linguistic reality}, mightmean something slightly different if \wo{world}, \wo{life}, \wo{language},\wo{person} and many other words meant something slightly different from whatthey do; and the necessity of repeating the sentence may be equated with thenonexistence of perfect synonyms or, more generally, of different sentences withperfectly same meaning.\ftnt{Which is not the case so that Wittgenstein himself  discusses counter-examples, e.g., \citeauthor*{WittPI}{ II:20}.}  But thenthere is not much sense in trying to explicate the phrase \wo{the relation of  language to extra-linguistic reality} nor, for that matter, any other phrase.Each means only what it means and is irreducible to any other.%This may be welcome but hardly to the philosophical champions of linguisticism --Language is for speaking, not forspeaking about, and the only task left is to catalogue various ways ofusing various phrases. On the other hand, although this relation \refeq{eq:relF} can be named andreferred to {\em in} the language, although its meaning is understood relativelyto the understanding of the words it involves and other words -- it is not bythis token linguistic.  There may be little sense in trying to {\em prove} thelimitation of the language using the language, but such a limitation can be {\em  shown}, or perhaps only pointed to. Even if it can not be \co{precisely}specified within the language, its \co{presence} can still be \co{clearly}indicated. This is one of the fundamental functions of language -- allowing usto talk about something we cannot say, to point towards something we cannotdefine \co{precisely}. This openness is both the strength and the flexibility ofnatural language.  There may be as many relations $r$ in \refeq{eq:relF} asthere are linguistic expressions, for each draws the \co{distinctions} inanother way, and words do nothing more (nor less) than that. But even such anunlimited variation does not change the basic fact which it, in fact, assumes:there is a limitation of language and this limitation -- the openness ontosomething more than mere language -- is the whole and only power oflanguage.\ftnt{Like every genuine strength, it is not owned by the one to whom  it is given and can sometimes even appear as weakness.} The limitation of thelanguage is that one can hardly explain the meaning of any word or phrase to onewho does not understand it, that one cannot explain what \wo{blue}, \wo{taste}or \wo{love} mean using the language alone; the limitation of the language isthat it cannot exist alone: \citet{to imagine a language means to imagine a form  of life.}{WittPI}{I:19} This limitation is what underlies the meaning oflanguage; language lives only through the relation which words and sentencescarry by being (used as) what they are: \co{dissociated signs}, epiphaniescapable of forgetting their\noo{divine} origin but incapable of functioningwithout it.%THUS: use SHOWS the meaning, but not IS the meaning%Wittgenstein??\pa The issues of truth and of meaning, distinct as they are, are veryintimately related and the \thi{coherentism} of the one will easily spill overthe other. Perhaps the most dramatic variant of coherentism says: \wo{Nothing  beyond the text.}\noo{Derrida, Of Grammatology,p.158} Text is absolutised as{\em the only} carrier and container of meaning and, consequently, if it isstill a legitimate idea at all, of truth.\noo{ Well, not even that -- {\em reading}of the text is the only such carrier.  True, unread text would hardly have anymeaning.  It is pity to have to spend time on trivialities but this is,unfortunately, what such claims result in.}  Let us imagine two readingscenarios.  1) I have a book, $B$, which I know was written by an author (whom Imay know or not, does not matter).  I read it and find a lot of interestingstuff, meaning, even truth, in it.  2) In the other scenario, I have exactly thesame book $B$ only I know that it was written by an \thi{intelligent} machine.% \ftnt{No impossible assumptions about enough%   monkeys typing for enough long time and producing Romeo and Juliet are made%   here. We are just assuming it for the sake of the illustration. For%   \thi{textualism}, however, such assumptions might even seem welcome.}Will the \thi{truth}, the \thi{meaning} of the book be the same in bothreadings?The champions of \thi{pure textuality} would like us to either abstract away thedifference or pretend that no difference obtains.  However, even if in 2) onewere able to understand exactly the same from $B$ as in 1) (except, perhaps, howthe heck did a machine manage to write {\em this}?), one would still not be ableto attach to it equal value nor, for that matter, equal meaning as in 1).  Itdoes not matter if one knows who exactly the author was, how much one possiblyknows about him and his time, although these things {certainly} {\em may}influence the reading and understanding of the text.  But what matters is thatone knows {\em that} the text was written by a human.  This, {\em in and by  itself}, makes the text a possible revelation of truth which can be trivial ordeep, simple or involved but, in any case, possibly relevant and touchingreader's humanity.  Reading is a form of communication with other humans, evenif the author is not present and if we want to call it fusion of the horizons ofmeaning,\noo{(mine and text's),} a process of personal interpretation of animpersonal cultural artifact, or whatever.  The fact that the text can involvemuch more than the author ever intended to put there is as uninteresting as thefact that an accidental slip of a tongue can mean something much more than theone to whom it happened is conscious of -- we are still dealing with humans andthis is the universal horizon, the eventual reference frame which encirclesevery text.And finally, if one got the same book $B$ without knowing who, or what, wroteit, its reading would be different from both 1) and 2).  Yet, reading it andgradually discovering (yes!  in the text only!)  some understandable, humanmeaning, one would create the image of the possible author in terms of 1), interms of a human who possibly might have written such a text.  At least, onewould think, bright guy, he says a lot of interesting things, while in themoments where things get a bit dubious one would, as usual, try to ignore thembut, perhaps eventually, use them to construct a more refined understanding ofthe \ldots {\em message}; perhaps, by augmenting what one understood with thedubious parts, perhaps, by ascribing them to the idiosyncrasy of the author.The point is only to repeat, after hermeneutics, that we do treat a text as apossible message worth deciphering, but it is such a message only because it wassent by another human. If it were sent by an ant or an\noo{ extraterrestrial or  extracelestial} extracelestial intelligence, we would be deciphering different-- slightly or perhaps vastly, different -- thing.In short, many texts of accidental, merely informative or purely entertainingvalue might be written by anybody, even machine.  But in the moment one assumes,expects, or discovers, some deeper meaning in the text, the text itself becomesa medium of human communication -- this is, eventually, the universal context ofevery text.\ftnt{The {\em individuality of the particular person} who happened  to write the text may, but need not, be of significance. \citef{[A] book is    created by another I than that which appears in our habits, in company, in    weaknesses. If we want to understand this I, we must try to recreate it in    our own depth [...]  Man who lives in the same body with a great genius has    little to do with the latter, but he is the only person known to his    acquaintances; consequently, it is absurd to evaluate a great poet, as    Sainte-Beuve does, according to what kind of person he is or what his    friends tell about him.}{ProustSB}{The method of    Sainte-Beuve's\noo{p.128/133:earlier in \btit{Sainte-Beuve and Baudelaire}}}  Unlike those who, dissatisfied with the petty \co{ego} of personal  folk-psychology, claim subject's total superficiality, here dispensing with  the former serves only the purpose of emphasizing text's origin in the deeper  layers of \co{self}, of genuine human subject(ivity).}%\newp\pa \wo{Nothing beyond the text} does not limit the attention to any single textbut to the \thi{textuality as such}; a single text, a {book} is but a piece of\thi{interminable text}, where other texts are the natural reference frame forany given one.  It is supposed to mean that there is no ground for assuming\citet{anything beyond the signs, anything whose sameness and existence would  not be conditioned by the process of naming.}{Text}{p.106 \citaft{RortyIM}{    p.77}} This sounds almost OK -- disquietingly so\ldots Let us ignore thetendency (of ones who seem to do nothing but reading and writing) to calleverything which involves signs \wo{text}.  Still, a sign which is not a sign{\em of something else} is not a sign!  It is, perhaps, a thing, a \thi{that},but what makes it a sign?  Only the \co{distance} between it and its meaning.  Amore drastic change of language seems to be needed, but what is the point inchanging the meaning of the word \wo{sign} to such an extent that it ceases todenote \thi{sign}?  \wo{\la{Simulacrum}}, a copy without any original, tries totake care of that, of reducing the \co{sign} to its purely \co{actual} dimensionand dispensing with anything signified, anything lying beyond its abstract\co{actuality}.\ftnt{We take notice of the remarks that \wo{text} does not mean  text but something hard to specify, some \co{totality} of \co{distinctions},  the \co{totality} of meanings or, perhaps, meaning-carriers, a web of beliefs,  a kind of network of interconnected -- or rather a magma of free floating and  hardly identifiable -- units; eventually, a pantheistic substance overriding  identity of its parts. The arguments of idealistic flavour, which point to the  impossibility of a contact between two dissociated substances, yield one  substance which, as also in our case, is the \co{one} underlied  differentiation. The absolutisation of \thi{text}, underlying the claims of  nothing lying beyond it, amounts to applying a similar argument which,  however, can be legitimately applied only to the ultimate \thi{substance}.}Most things exist and function completely independently from the process ofnaming but, indeed, they emerge only in the process of \co{distinguishing}. Thedifference might seem to concern only the wording, but it is quite fundamental,as fundamental as that between \co{actual signs} and the general\co{distinctions} or else, as that between \co{actuality} and \co{presence}. Certainly, \co{distinctions} arise only gradually and at every stage form awhole system -- there is no such thingas a single \co{distinction} existing \thi{in itself} independently from others.% ; transitions between levels concern primarily the degree of% \co{precision} of the involved \co{distinctions}.Similarly, what is meant by \wo{love} is related to, perhaps even dependent on,what is meant by \wo{sympathy}, \wo{affection}, \wo{hate}, etc.  So, inprinciple, we can agree that meanings of all words are woven into a total web ofthe language.  But this inter-dependence is only a reflection of the\co{distinctions} drawn in the matter of \co{experience}, between things,feelings, understandings.  The plasticity of the {\em web} of language at bestreflects only the plasticity of the \co{experience}, like the \co{actual signs}\co{reflect} only \co{distinctions} drawn also beyond the \hoa.  But it does notmean that every single, \co{actual} element of this web has a meaning only byits relation to the rest and is conditioned exclusively by such a relation.  Onthe contrary, unlike a scientific theory (which, according to Quine, is a vasttheoretical super-structure only at its outer boundary touching the world ofexperience and experiments), natural language meets \co{experience} at {\em  every} point; the fact that meaning of a particular statement can depend onmeanings of other words and statements does not in any way cut this particularstatement off from its relation to the extra-linguistic aspect of\co{experience}, from the extra-linguistic \co{distinctions} which it draws andaddresses.\thi{Text}, any system of \co{signs}, or language is indeed, as Merleau-Pontysays, \citet{life itself, our and thing's life.  [But] not that {\em language}  conquers and appropriates them, for what would be left for saying, if there  existed only things said?  It is a mistake of semantic philosophies to close  language as if it spoke only about itself, because it lives [by] silence;  everything we throw to others grew up in this great, mute country which will  never leave us.}{VisInvis}{Inquiry and intuition;p.131\label{cit:mute}}Expanding a bit this statement, we would add that the \thi{mute country} can itself be organised by\co{signs} which themselves need not have linguistic character, but even theseare \co{signs} only by the force of their meaning (eventually,\co{non-actuality}) which they bring into the horizon of our attention.\co{Sign} is the paradigm of \co{actuality}, and \co{dissociated sign as a sign}the paradigm of \co{immediacy}.  The insistence on pure textuality and absenceof anything beyond the \co{signs}, in its attempts to escape from simplifiedcorrespondence to \co{actualities}, falls straight back into the midst of\thi{metaphysics of actuality} which, de-mitologised by the removal of the lastelement of \co{transcendence}, becomes pure \co{immediacy} of a mere {sign}.The \la{simulacrum} of \co{transcendence}, the \thi{interminable text}, appearsas the ultimate form of \co{subjectivistic illusion} which sees nothing beyondthe \hoa\ but other \co{actualities}, now not even \co{objects} but only\co{signs}.  Perhaps, it is only an accident, perhaps, an intellectual sickness:searching for \thi{the other}, it finds only itself; in the midst of its searchfor the ultimate \co{transcendence}, it \co{thirsts} for ecstatic unity, and sokeeps removing the \co{transcendence}, narrowing the attention to what, being\co{immediately} given, deludes \co{reflection} with the promises of \co{unity}.And so, \citet{in that outward moving there is frustration or compulsion; a  thing most exists not when it takes multiplicity or extension but when it  holds to its own being, that is when its movement is  inward.}{Plotinus}{VI:6.1}~\ftnt{The simplistic relation to formal logic  suggested in \refp{pa:truthB}, footnote~\ref{ftnt:locales}, can be given more  substance by observing the trend according to which logic is not about  formulae but about proofs (which must not be confused with proof-theory!  --Roughly, proof-theory studies derivations of valid formulae, while the  genuine concern with proofs addresses only their internal mechanisms and  structures). The work, and general philosophy, of Jean-Yves Girard can serve  as an excellent example of the attempt to carry out the programme quite  ambitious and admirable when judged by the strictly scientific standards: get  rid of the traditional syntax-semantics split, explain the meaning of the  (syntactic) entities by the role they play in proofs, internalise  meta-considerations by requiring and utilising reflection principle (in the  technical sense of converting higher-order statements into equivalent  first-order ones). All these goals of pure logic can be seen as a reflection  of the more general, philosophical immanentism discussed above. With respect  to the last point, in \citeauthor*{LocusSolum}, we even find the quote from  Wittgenstein: \citef{I may play Chess according to certain rules. But I may    also invent a game where I play with the rules themselves.  The pieces of    the game are then the rules of chess and the rules of the game are, say, the    rules of logic. In this case, I have {\em yet another game}, not {\em a      metagame}.}{WittRemarks}{}\noo{\btit{Locus Solum: from the rules of logic      to the logic of rules} has a nice dictionary which, to some extent, can be    understandable even for a philosopher.} As such projects and observations  might be, and to some degree rightly, associated with our views, let us only  emphasize the crucial difference: \co{one} is \co{above} all the webs and  games which also are their own metagames. The moment in which this \co{transcedent    origin} of all \co{distinctions} is ignored marks the beginning of  immanentism.\label{ftnt:logicB}}If we are willing to see in the \thi{text} a \co{totality} of meanings, aplastic \co{totality} of fluid elements with always unsharp boundaries, we mightsee in it an analogy to our \co{chaos}. But beyond \co{chaos}, there is\co{nothingness}. There is something beyond the \thi{text}, something that mayseem infinitesimal and insignificantly small, but which, exactly by lyingbeyond all differentiations, weights more than their whole web. It is a moment ofsilence, of silence which is tranquil and not intense, grateful and not awaitinganything. A moment of silence which neither grasps nor reaches for anything butmakes all the things and meanings light, weightless, which suspends all meaningsand thus, almost paradoxically, endows their totality with the deepest meaning-- the touch of eternity \co{above} in which all meanings and differencesdisappear, this \thi{transcendental signified}\noo{Grammatology,p.49} whichhalts the regress of potentially infinite re-interpretations of \co{signs} by\co{signs}, of one \co{actuality} by another. It is only from such moments, fromsuch an ultimately mute country beyond, that the \thi{intertextual} web arises.Just like everybody enters this web from there, so in the moment of genuinesilence one also leaves this web and touches eternity \co{above} it. Although suchmoments may be very rare, they do occur and, easy to ignore as they are, theytestify to the tremendous difference between the interminable search for the\co{totality} of \co{visible signs}, which can rest only in the ideal limits oreschatological phantasies, and the \co{unity} of truth \co{present} in the lifeone is living.\ad{\mine Truth of totality} The \co{objectivistic illusion} underlyingsimplistic versions of correspondence theories, is likewise manifest as\co{subjectivistic illusion} in coherentism: first, in the fact that the wholebecame a mere \thi{text}, a collection of mere \co{actualities}, \co{signs}; andthen, in the usual multiplication of facts and truths (here, \co{signs}) as onetries to embrace the whole; the whole which refuses to appear as anything morethan a \co{totality}.  Coherence (sometimes reduced to mere logical consistency)is a desired property of such a \co{totality}, being an indication of thepossibility that one has \co{actually} grasped the whole. %, the \thi{significant whole}, as Joachim said,The main problem we have with pictures like that of Pierce's truth is that thewhole is simply a \co{totality}; perhaps, well organised and structured butstill only a \co{totality}. Moreover, it extends beyond any reasonable limits ofinquiry -- this is why the truth about it must be postponed until indefinitefuture, for it will take infinity of time to collect and study the infinite\co{totality} of facts, problems and phenomena and to arrive at a consensusconcerning it. As most regulative ideas and ideal limits, it betrays the attemptto capture something higher in terms of a \co{totality} of lower elements.\co{Totality} is a project of \co{mineness} and the corresponding mode of\co{horizontal transcendence}, the \co{not-mine}, has the particularlysignificant modification: the others. Focusing on this aspect of\co{transcendence} leads to replacing the more or less conceptual coherence withthe social consensus.The eventual context of all considerations is the context of one's life. This,however, is a never ended \co{totality}, a \co{totality} which seems to possessno internal coherence except that \citet{which it happened to obtain at the last  turn of hermeneutical circle.}{RortyPP}{\citaft{RortyIM}{ p.72}} Any possible\co{transcendence} announced by \co{signs} is attempted removed, so that eventhe system of \co{signs}, the ever escaping \la{simulacrum} of the\thi{interminable text}, gives place to the arbitrariness of \co{mineness}.Indeed, where is the possible distinction between mere opinion and knowledge,between private idiosyncrasy and general validity?  Nobody ever gave a\co{precise}, rigid definition of it.  So \ldots there is no distinction, atleast, none possible to maintain.But nobody wants to be swallowed up by the arbitrariness of\thi{subjectivity}.\noo{Derridean \thi{postcards} attempting to illustrate the  impossibility, or at least inadequacy, of a general language and theories by  insisting on private, purely idiosyncratic ways of constructing a  \thi{narrative} provide an example of such a turn which tries also to maintain  the absence of anything beyond the privacy of associations and its  self-sufficiency, needing no involvement into the questions about possible  truth.  This \thi{privacy} and opposition to generality (if not explicitly  conceptual, then in any case, acted and expressed) squares rather badly with  the claim \wo{nothing beyond the text} for now it seems rather that there is  \wo{nothing beyond the reader}.  But whoops, no, no!  There is no reader, and  if there is any, he is only an \thi{interminable text} himself.  Or, perhaps,  it is something completely different, only one prefers to avoid playing {\em    this} \thi{language game}. Sure, why not, it is nice to get a postcard, even  if it does not say anything.}%Beyond \co{me} there are others, the whole community, tradition.  Thesociological aspect appears (albeit in as yet limited and not aggressive form)already with Pierce since, for some reason, the eventual usefulness of anopinion cannot be judged by its own standards, it requires a consensus.\citet{And the catholic consent which constitutes the truth is by no means to be  limited to men in this earthly life or to the human race, but extends to the  whole communion of minds to which we belong, including some probably whose  senses are very different from ours, so that in that consent no predication of  a sensible quality can enter, except as an admission that so certain sorts of  senses are affected.}{PierceBerkeley}{p.83} Indeed, one may try to pay the duerespect to the \co{transcendent} character of truth, to overcome\co{subjectivism} or even solipsism by appeals to a community, by blurring thedistinction between the \thi{objective} and the \thi{inter-subjective}. This wayof \thi{taking care of} the \co{transcendence} of \co{not-mine}, characterisingthe sociological invasion of philosophy, amounts really to its removal andleaves, eventually, only a community of writing and speaking, a community of\thi{narratives}.  Then there seems to be only one goal: let's interact, talkand \wo{keep conversation going}.  Strangely enough, one drags in all kind ofextra-conversational, extra-textual things like ethics, society, culture,solidarity\ldots So, after all, does not conversation suffice?  It seems it doesnot.  For pragmatical mind, conversation is only means of action, and a goodconversation brings in powerful narratives, effective metaphors.  But appeals todescriptions and metaphors which simply work, which are effective, which servethe purpose seem rather empty if keeping the conversation going is {\em the}goal.  (Sure, it is not {\em the} goal because there is no such thing as {\em  the} goal.  One is only pressed by \thi{wrong language game} to say what thepoint possibly might be.)  But even the strictest codes of a court etiquette,enabling one to spend time conversing without saying anything, had always leftan opening for actually saying something.  Reducing everything to a game of\la{simulacra} one would still like to escape the resulting arbitrariness, thatis, to retain the possibility of saying something.  And so one needs something-- tolerance, solidarity\ldots -- which sounds sufficiently convincing\thi{in itself}.  But is it convincing?  Sure, because \thi{decent fellows like  us} do accept such values.  But what if I am not one of the conversationalclub, if I am not a decent guy and do not accept such values?  I guess, I am notpart of the game, I am not admitted to the conversation.  But then, since onetalks about \thi{solidarity} and \thi{tolerance}, of constant extension of thehorizon of \thi{we}, so please, extend it, perhaps even to the guys who bombone's home town.  This, after all, is only an expression of a yet another,powerful narrative metaphor.\pa There is certainly an element of truth in it. Consensus, just likecoherence, need not exclude truth and it is often important to achieve anagreement with others which means, to accept the same truths, with respect tothe same horizon of \co{distinctions}.  One can also think of more extreme caseswhere all the \co{distinctions} of relevance are {\em only} those agreed upon bythe community -- then the criterion of truth will become conformance to them.This could remind a bit too much of a petty-bourgeois conformism but this, orthe general smell of ethnocentrism around the consensus theories, can always bedissipated by positing some more ideal communities like the one just seen inPierce, or a bit more limited community of rational discourse, or otherinventions of the kind. The element of truth hiding behind the consensus theories concerns the\co{vague} intuition of its transpersonal \co{aspect}. This \co{aspect} oftruth, however, is not transpersonal because it resides only in some communalconsensus but, on the contrary, because, being \co{present} in every human, it\co{transcends} {\em his} \co{reflection} and the \co{subjectivity} of his mere\co{representations}. It is the \co{aspect} of \co{non-actual foundation}, theIntellect, which surrounds every \co{actual} person with the sphere where\citet{the object known [is] identical with the knowing agent, the  Intellectual-Principle, therefore, identical with the Intellectual  Realm,}{Plotinus}{V:3.5\label{cit:actIsObject}}\ref{sub:notunconscious}-\ref{sub:invArch} and \ref{sub:objsubj}.  But replacing\thi{truth} by \thi{inter-subjectivity}, consensus theory reduces possible truthto that about which all might reach an \co{actual} consensus, and that is closeto nothing.  Failing to escape \co{my} subjectivity in the sphere of socialsubjectivity, failing to rest satisfied with the inaccessible ideal limits, oneinvents eventually the ideal of consensus allowing everybody run his ownbusiness, the ideal of plurality and non-conformism.% The \thi{pluralistic universe} where \thi{anything goes} may have valuable% aspects, but in this context it may be read as \wo{anything is true -- just make%   it work}.This is only a slight variation on the old theme of pragmatic ethics in a\thi{pluralistic universe} taken over by the recent masters of manifold andvariety.  Having lost, in the plurality of disparate opinions and\thi{discourses}, any means of saying that something is more important, morevaluable, higher, deeper or more true than something else, and thus of sayingwhat possibly might be a meaningful goal for which things should \thi{work}, theonly possibility left is to embrace everything.  One even imagines systems(political, cultural) allowing for non-conformism. (Positive, as the intentionsbehind such, as behind most other utopias, can be, the result reflects only theorigin: the absolutisation of atomism on the social scale, only claimed to havepositive value.) However, just like a sign which does not signify is not a\co{sign}, so a system open for everything is not any system but \ldots a lackthereof. Also, non-conformism which is allowed as an option, as if calculatedinto the system, is not any longer non-conformism.  A system allowingnon-conformism, by this very token, abolishes its possibility.  One could,perhaps, keep conversation going.  But everyone should know the situations wherethis becomes a mere gesture of unbearable politeness, because what the other issaying, no matter how intelligent and well-argued, is simply nonsense.Universal pluralism and tolerance would have one main consequence -- totalde-individualisation and indolence, uniformity, the exact opposite of theintended variety\ldots Discourse in such a setting would, too, cease to havemeaning, because where everything is allowed, where all goals are equally good,where everything is acceptable, there is no need to argue (not to say fight) foranything. When everybody is entitled to be heard, eventually, nobody bothers tolisten. Sure, these are only idealizations,\thi{regulative ideas} since no suchthing can ever happen.  Yet, there are some who speak as if they wanted them tohappen\ldots\pa Certainly, admitting {\em every possible} variety of narrative metaphors isa bit too generous. But saying what should be excluded, by the very fact ofexcluding something some members of the all-embracing community might defend,points always beyond the limits of possible consensus. However, having onlynarratives without any inherent and mutual values, such exclusion appearsarbitrary.  No matter how explicitly one admits ethnocentric assumptions, oneremains ethnocentric which, eventually, means arbitrarily self-satisfied.  Andif anything at all might possibly be meant by \wo{truth} it can not stand alltoo much arbitrariness.  The convenient words one tries to invoke --\wo{solidarity}, \wo{universality}, \wo{communicability}, \wo{tolerance} --point towards something which one believes would cure this arbitrariness,something \ldots fundamentally human.  Ethics seem to replace truth; not in theKantian way, though, as complementing the project of knowledge of appearances,but simply {\em replacing} it.  Ethics, moreover, devoid of any truth, that isan arbitrary \thi{ought} to mere worship of manifold and plurality, growth anddiversification, increase \ldots The popular medical term for that is\wo{cancer}.  Truth is only what works, and so is good.  Powerful metaphors,powerful narratives \ldots But what makes a metaphor, a narration {\em  powerful}?  What is it that makes some language \citet{strike also the next  generation as inevitable}{RortyCIS}{I:2;p.29}?  Communism was once a powerfulnarrative, many next generations were struck by it as inevitable. And itsprolific, powerful consequences\ldots Yet its power was not very different from-- in fact, was founded in -- its falsehood.  Is it so that people somewhatintuit that this and not that narrative can be made effective, used to changethings?  Change to the better, perhaps?  These are, of course, \thi{wrong  questions}, which assume that there is some \thi{what} behind the actual eventof a narrative simply happening to be powerful. It just happens, and so does truth.So let it happen in most prolific ways, with no interference or persecution ofits possible happenings.  (Why such a proliferation is to be any better thanunification is not clear -- after all, consensus seems closer to the latter thanto the former but, we might guess, one wants to be politically correct.)\noo{  claiming, without clarifying, both.}\pa It might seem that we are confusing two distinct issues: consensus theoriesof truth and the politically motivated views trying to admit free unfolding andmultiplicity of views. We join the two because they both arise from the sameperspective putting the social aspect in front of any other.  The problem ofnon-conforming groups and individuals is equally annoying to the consensustheories as to those preaching unrestricted proliferation of narratives: thelatter have to exclude deviant individuals and dangerous narratives, while theformer, in addition, also admit for those who announce some truths before thetimes are ripe for a general consensus about them.  Somehow, they must takenon-conformism into account and, trying to do so, step beyond the purity oftheir basic claim. Freedom of unfolding, as well as consensus, must be qualifiedby some additional element -- of respecting the limits, of being reasonable, ofnot coercing others. And indeed, even a mere fear of being persecuted can beequally good means of coercion as actual persecution.  But if we need to excludepersecution to upgrade a mere consensus, or a pluralistic non-conformism, or thepower of narratives, or whatever comes next, to the level of truth, why notdispense with all these concepts and upgrades and only say that it is enough notto persecute?  \wo{Truth is non-persecution.}  Well, it does not sound bad,does it?  Why not?  Because it again touches something which one wants torecognise as humanly correct, not to say true. Even if truth is something that,in principle, everybody could recognise, it does not mean that it is somethingeverybody actually recognises. And it is likewise with falsehood. The servilityof praising something that \thi{strikes also the next {generation} as  inevitable} is as astonishing as the depersonalisation andde-individualisation implied by the unrestricted pluralism.  It is an invitation(the less intended, the worse) to following the mob psychology, like that whichforced the victims of Marxism (in all its variants) to follow the\thi{development} proclaimed inevitable for all future generations.%   -- [not-me: CONSENSUS/absolutised: SOCILOGISM or%   PANTHEISM : the absolute is totality]The consensus theories, this absolutised sociologism, reflect the mentality of astock market and agents of public relations, or else the wishes of theministries of propaganda.  No doubt, there are sociological dimensions andsituations in which mob's convictions are sufficient for action or, as isusually the case, mass hysteria.  Thirst for \co{visible} criteria endstypically with conflating the criteria with the things they were onlysupposed to be criteria of. But have we not heard enough lies which, repeatedsufficiently many times, refused to become truths.  \thi{Inter-subjectivity}, nomatter how pluralistic, how total or totalitarian, is still a {\em  subjectivity}, something which can not constitute truth but only, and only atbest, discover it.\ftnt{If we were to draw free associations to some aspects of  formal logic, we would focus here on the attempts to incorporate  \thi{otherness} by not negating its value. Formally, it can be seen as a  further limitation of negation's omnipotence by renunciation of the law of  excluded middle.  Three-valued or, generally, many-valued logics are examples  of that. (We are not discussing here technical intricacies.  The fact that,  for instance, three-valued logic can be formally represented by introducing  the meta-predicate of validity (or truth), within two-valued logic certainly  does not concern us here.) As often happened in the history of mathematical  logic, the beginnings go back to philosophy, indeed, to Aristotle's'  syllogisms and future contingents.  A third logical value, introduced by  {\L}ukasiewicz, denoted the \thi{unknown} truth-value of statements  about future contingents.    The diminution of the absolute role of negation reflects the recognition of  some form of boundedness of our truth-gaining capacities, perhaps even genuine  incompleteness of \co{our} knowledge.  In spite of all Leibnizean  constructions of complete notions of substances which contain all future  events which will happen to them, {\em we} do not know if \wo{there will be a    sea-battle tomorrow}.  Already Arnauld pointed out to Leibniz that we should  better concern ourselves with the ways {\em we} can know things, rather than  with the ways God might know them.  The logics with non-contradiction  principle and law of excluded middle, if taken as more then mere logics,  reflect rather God's than our view of the universe.  Logics renouncing the  excluded middle are motivated by incompleteness of {\em our} knowledge, by the  simple fact that \co{I} may not know whether $P$ or not-$P$ is (going to  become) true. (The (in)completeness of knowledge being modeled is not to be  confused with the (in)completeness of the logical system itself.) Besides  many-valued logics, one can mention here intuitionistic logic, built precisely  around the idea of knowledge which remains incomplete and limited to the facts  which can be positively constructed, as well as, fuzzy logics which try to  model vagueness of concepts.  Linear logic of Girard is a completely different  example where incompleteness of the modeled system corresponds rather to the  boundedness of resources consumed during the reasoning process.\label{ftnt:logicC}}\newp \ad{\inv The absolute truth} %One\citet{Truth in its essential nature  is that systematic coherence which is the character of a significant whole.

It is the sphere where the clue is not toinclude \co{more} heterogeneous \thi{facts} into a unifying theory but rather tounderstand that \thi{less is more}, that the same \co{eternal} things penetrateall variety of \co{actualities}. The truth addressing the level of\co{invisibles} is rather contained in simple words of wisdom than in complexityof smart arguments.

The \co{absolute} truth does not embrace allthe lower, \co{visible} ones -- it abolishes them.  The \co{distance} separatingthe \co{actual signs} from their meaning is here so remote, that no \co{visible}rules can any longer govern the expressions of truth. And only the exclusive reliance on the \co{visible} rules and criteria can confuse their lack witharbitrariness and the absence of truth.\noo{The \co{unity} of \co{one} lies \co{above} the multitude of  \co{distinctions} and even though \woo{He said one [...] I heard two.}{Ps.}}The \co{unity} of one being certainly admits contradictions.  Viewing this\co{unity} in its temporal aspect, there is nothing contradictory in being, atone time $P$ and, at another time, not-$P$.  But much more can be said.  \co{I}can, at the same time, both like and dislike a person.  And it is not of muchuse to say that then \co{I} like and dislike distinct properties of the person,because persons are not \co{complexes} of properties but individual beings.Sure, \co{I} can like the person for \thi{being x} and dislike for \thi{being  y}.  But \co{I} can also, simultaneously, both love and not-love the person,the whole person.  \citeti{I hate her and I love her.

This can be blamed merely on theinadequacy of the language to express the actual feelings. But blaming it forsuch an \thi{inadequacy}, one has already assumed that the feelings must beprone to a \co{precise} description in terms of \co{immediacy}, that is,non-contradiction.  Higher things seldom are prone to such descriptions and,indeed, their descriptions can often be most adequate by using contradictorypredicates.  Coming to terms with such higher aspects of one's life, it isnecessary to realise that simple yes-no questions can have no answers.  Onesitting there and trying desperately to figure out \wo{Do I love her or not? Do  I or do I not?\ldots} is probably still in his adolescence, trying to capturethe accumulated tension of \co{vagueness} and \co{clarity} in the categories ofrecently developed \co{precision} and \co{reflective visibility}.%\noo{Much of the adolescent \thi{pain and suffering} is related exactly to the  appearing need to disambiguate a series of issues which, so far, have lived  quietly in their genuine element without any precise borders or  determinations.}%When, eventually, some \co{action} must be undertaken, one may have to bringeverything down to the \co{actual} choice between yes and no: \wo{Shall I invite  her for a dinner or not?} But it is a question about \co{actual} course ofaction where, indeed, contradictions can be intolerable.\ftnt{The logical aspect  of this level of truth takes the final step in decreasing the role of negation  by renouncing also the law of non-contradiction, admitting states (or  theories) with both $P$ and not-$P$. ({It is very doubtful or, in any case,    quite disputable whether such things are still logics and if they are good    for anything at all. But we are not concerned with the value, nor even    comparison, of logical systems which we are observing here from an external    and un-mathematical point.})  There may be various \co{actual} reasons for  that.  One, exemplified in non-monotonic logics, is the wish to model  development of states of belief. At some point, one may simply not know which  of the two holds. This can be now taken not so strictly as in intuitionistic  logic (which simply denies the law of excluded middle) but as saying that both  are possible and one may be allowed to draw conclusion from the one and the  other.  This is a weak form of para-consistent logic where one would simply  allow an agent to \thi{know}, \thi{believe}, \thi{be in a state} including  both $P$ and not-$P$.  Admitting such states in a stronger sense may be  motivated by examples of, typically, scientific theories, which involve or  entail contradictions, but which are not meaningless. This may be also a way  of approaching some paradoxes, like liar paradox, which seem to be  \thi{dialetheias}, \thi{true contradictions}, since they can be understood as  being simultaneously both true and false. In any case, the main consequence of  admitting (apparent or real) contradictions is that one has to prevent the  possibility of obtaining from them all possible propositions (as would be the  case in classical logic), which would again equate such states with something  meaningless.    Most generally, such logics relativise the meaning of negation. In the  non-adjunctive system of Ja\'{s}kowski's discourse logic, negation applies to  the statements of the same interlocutor but not to those of others; in  non-truth-functional system of da Costa, the value of not-$P$ is completely  independent from the value of $P$; in relevant logic, pioneered by Anderson  and Belnap, negation becomes a purely intentional operation, so that $P$ and  not-$P$ are interpreted in different structures. This can be related to the  recognition that concepts are not precise but vague and hence negation does  not posit an absolute alternative but remains itself, so to say,  underdetermined.  Going in this direction, para-consistence might approach  fuzzy or many-valued logics which, indeed, can be used for modeling  para-consistency as proposed, e.g., by Asenjo.\label{ftnt:logicD} Nicholas of  Cusa could be probably seen as a pioneer in this field, although his  motivations were of purely spiritual nature and his attempts aimed only to  communicate the true \equin\ of opposites in the \co{origin}. His  \la{coincidentia oppositorum} concerns \citef{the Uniting Beginning, [where]    we see opposites prior to duality, i.e., before they are two    contradictories.

Let us notice in passing that a \co{sign} meaning\co{nothingness} is very different from a \co{sign} meaning nothing, or from thelack of \co{sign}: silence meaning \co{nothingness}, \ger{Stille und Ewigkeit},is different from silence which does not mean anything or, as the case may be,is only tensely expecting its own termination waiting for somebody to saysomething.\ftnt{Thus, on the one hand, \citefi{Silence alone is Thy    praise.}{Ps.}{LXV:2; St.~Jerome's translation} But not all silence is  praise, for there is also silence of emptiness, of lack turned into  disappointment: \citefi{Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost    dwelt in silence.}{Ps.}{XCIV:17\kilde{Ps.94}}\label{ftnt:silencePraise}}Also (and now we see again the inadequacy of simplistic pseudo-mathematisationslike $\subseteq$ in \refp{pa:notArbitraryD}.\refeq{eq:truth}), as intentionsbelong to meanings, there is a fundamental difference between a \co{sign} whichboth intends and means \co{nothingness}, and one which, intending something,means nothing, between a \la{koan} and an overlooked contradiction. The \co{absolute} truth is \co{that}: \co{that} there is, or else, \co{that}there is truth. And what is \co{that}? \co{Nothing}, \co{that} which makes itimpossible for any person or any community to {\em arbitrarily} decide what istrue. At the same time, \co{that} makes it possible to oppose any particular\thi{truth} which \co{actuality} might attempt to \co{posit} as the truth, asthe \co{absolute} truth.  Falsehood with respect to the \co{nothingness} is notits plain negation, something; it is not anything specifically distinguished assuch, because no particular thing, no \co{distinction} opposes the\co{absoluteness} of \co{indistinct}.  \co{Indistinct} remains untouched\co{above} the whole world, \co{above} all \co{distinctions} and falsehood withrespect to \co{that} amounts to projecting some \co{distinctions} into the\co{indistinct}.  \co{Absolute} falsehood is something particular {\em only  when} predicated about the \co{absolute} or, what amounts to the same,absoluteness predicated about anything relative -- in short, an \co{idol}.\pa \co{Idolatry} divides because, \co{positing} something relative as\co{absolute}, it \co{alienates} from \co{that} which is \co{one}; trying tomake it \co{visible}, it not only veils but also falsifies it.  Relativity meanslimited scope and validity, and \co{positing} it as \co{absolute} sets oneagainst all that contradicts this absoluteness, namely, all that falls outsideits scope.  And so, he that tries to unify under some \co{visible} slogans, endsup dividing, \citeti{he that gathereth not [in truth] scattereth  abroad.}{Mt.}{XII:30/Lk.XI:23} The scattered pieces, the pieces left outsidethe scope of the \co{actual} unity remain, however, as the seeds of constantrestlessness, disquieting reminders of the refusal and exclusion.  And\citeti{[t]he stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the  corner.}{Ps.}{CXVIII:22} The new building, to last, must not be just arearrangement of the old pieces including, in addition, a few pieces previouslyexcluded. It is raised only by accepting relativity of the relative and ceasingto search for the \co{absolute} among the \co{visible} pieces.      Truth is the way of -- and, as a \co{trace} of \co{transcendence}, a norm, acall to -- \co{unity}, keeping heaven and earth together. It is the\co{transcendent unity} and as such a contra-distinction to the falsehood of the\co{actuality} taken as \co{absolute}. It is the element of \co{transcending} --beyond \co{actuality} -- which establishes it primarily as the {\em call} to\co{unity}, as the {\em norm} of preserving the \co{unity}.  Following this normunites, but not necessarily in any trivial sense of a conceptual agreement -- itunites primarily in a complete disagreement, \co{above} and as if in spite ofany \co{actual} conflicts.\ftnt{\citefi{What opposes unites, and the finest    attunement stems from things bearing in opposite directions, and all things    come about by strife. -- Graspings: things whole and not whole, what is    drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant.    The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the    one.}{Heraclitus}{DK 22B8-B10.} We are, of course, very far from any  pantheistic interpretations of the slightly unlucky phrase opening the last  sentence.} It is not a trivial acceptance, which often means justabsolutisation, of all the differences. It is rather an admittance that thesedifferences are only of relative value, are manifestations of something which,remaining \co{invisible}, unites.  The image of truth as the absolute either-or,not admitting any degrees and compelling everybody to unconditional acceptance,as both \co{absolute} and \co{visible}, is a fallen angel reminding of the lostparadise. \citet{The urge to possess absolutely {\em only certainties} is a  residual religious drive, and nothing more.}{WS}{16\noo{after Lou Salome's    Nietzsche, p.82}} It is the \co{trace} of the highest aspect of\co{absolute} truth which, however, concerns only the \co{absolute}.  Among therelativity of \co{actual} facts, truth can hardly  conform to such standards.%As everything \co{spiritual}, it is fully or it is not at all.)Any demands for it to \co{actually} and \co{visibly} unify and gather are onlyways of reducing its meaning and power.  For \co{absolute} truth is not relativeto any particular aspects of our \co{actual} world and life, but exercises itspower \co{above}, as the ultimate norm, ever reminding us about the onlyrelative significance of whatever we manage to capture under our \co{actual}look and grasp. Reducing it to any \co{visible} norms and criteria falsifies itscharacter of being exactly the \co{absolute} norm which remains valid when all\co{actual} criteria have failed or been violated.\pa Every \co{actuality} is a \co{sign} which may be true or not with respect tothe \co{absolute}.  In the deepest sense life, viewed as a constant\co{confrontation} of \co{actuality} with \co{transcendence}, can be true.  Tolive in truth is to live in conformance to the \co{origin}, in the \co{unity  above visible} dispersion; to use Luria's inventive imagery, to gather thedispersed pieces; in the constant process of restoration, \heb{<<tiqqun>>}, tokeep repairing the divine vessels broken in the earlier stage of dispersion,\heb{<<shevirat ha-kelim>>}.\ftnt{The same intuitions seem to underlie the Orphic  myth of Zagreus-Dionysus' rebirth -- return to the original unity -- from the  pieces scattered in the souls of all people.}  Successful%gathering\heb{tiqqun} concerns the whole hierarchy of Being, \co{unifies} all its levelsaround the highest truth; not in any coherent theory but in the full recognitionof the relative differences, even incommensurability, of lower\co{distinctions}, whose possible consistency and compatibility never sums up tothe ultimate \co{unity}. The \co{signs} can be true in different degree,depending on the level they address. An \co{idol} is hardly ever a complete lie,it can be promoted to the special status precisely because it harbours sometruth; but the status of the \co{absolute} is undeserved because it is only {\em  relative} truth. I saw once a professor (of philosophy!) conducting a proof infirst-order logic for the statement that God who is both omnipotent and goodcannot possibly exist.  Formally, the proof was correct and His Professorshipseemed very pleased with himself -- he almost seemed to believe that he actuallyproved anything of interest. But correctness, and truth, with respect to thelevel of mathematical immediacy need not reflect any truth with respect todeeper perception and understanding of the world. One can be both right andwrong at the same time.\ftnt{In a particular case, it can be hard to say if  rigidity is an expression of pride, of insecurity, or of both, but it is easy  to notice that one can be both intelligent and stupid. Such observations might  be taken only as a preliminary to the observation \thi{the smarter, the more    stupid} from \refp{pa:smartStupid}.}  Truth of most statements terminates atthe level which they address, and in this very fact there hides an additionalaspect of truth, of knowing and respecting the limits. But there are also othermodes of speaking. The similes, invoked in wisdom literature and variousBiblical stories, are true at several levels -- not because they can beinterpreted in various ways but because their plain meaning extends to andmerges with the senses at deeper and deeper levels. This is the rare \co{unity}of wisdom which is able to embrace the truth of whole human being in the\co{actuality} of one image, in a few simple \co{signs}.%\paIn the deepest sense, a life can be true, a life which is lived in conformanceto the \co{origin}. This does not in any way assume any \thi{essence of human  nature}, but it does suggest that there are some fundamental aspects of the\co{existential} situation which, deserving respect and recognition, can beignored and forgotten. (We will address them in Book III.)  Truth in thestrictest, metaphysical sense of an access to the unchangeable reality appliesonly to the deepest sphere of life.  Simply because this sphere of ultimately\co{invisible foundation}, and its relations to the lower sphere of\co{visibility}, is the only constant aspect of human experience and history.\citet{Our fundamental ways of thinking about things are discoveries of  exceedingly remote ancestors, which have been able to preserve themselves  throughout the experience of all subsequent times.}{Pragmatism}{p.83  \citaft{Cotkin}{ p.165}} But the fact that they \thi{have been able to  preserve themselves} is not an accident of the historical development prone topragmatic verification. They were able to preserve themselves only because theyreflect the deepest aspects of human situation.  The lower aspects and,eventually, concepts, ideas and theories are certainly prone to steadyre-evaluation.  But this in no way affects the truth concerning the ultimatereality of our being. This truth needs no arguments and demonstrations, it is\co{above} all truths, unaffected by their passage and indefeasible by theirpretensions, waiting in its eternal silence until the skirmishes which futuretimes fight against the past fall silent too. \citet{We have incapacity of  proof, insurmountable by all dogmatism.  We have an idea of truth, invincible  to all scepticism.}{Pensees}{VI:395} This truth is what it always has been andevery human being can only attempt to live it \co{concretely} or, as the casemay be, fail to do so.  To dissolve the \co{absolute} in the relativity of\co{visible} truths is to falsify it, for \citet{it is absurd to make the fact  that the things of this earth are observed to change and never to remain in  the same state, the basis of our judgment about the truth.}{AristMeta}{XI:6.  We will not, of course, follow this observation with the conclusion that,  since only heavenly bodies are \wo{always in the same state and suffer no    change}, they have anything more to do with the \co{absolute} truth, for  this is already reducing the \co{absolute} to the \co{visible}, if only  remotely so.}  An unmistakable sign of such an absurd is ascription of\co{absoluteness} to some relative truth.  This is the {\em only} \co{absolute}untruth the history of human kind has ever seen.\sep\pa\label{pa:immedArbitrary} Let us summarise briefly.The particular ways in which particular judgments or theories are checked vary tremendously leaving hardly any universal criteria to stick to.  This,however, does not mean that I can judge as I please, and all {theories of truth}try, in one way or another, to account for the absence of such arbitrariness.Arbitrariness is the pure \co{immediacy}, the pure subjectivity of mere \la{hic  et nunc} which, \co{dissociated} from all the \co{rest}, seems to offer itscontents in a wild spontaneity. Arbitrariness is pure{immanentism}, \co{dissociation} of \co{immediacy} from its context,surroundings and, eventually, origin.  To account for non-arbitrariness oftruth one does, willingly or not, point to some form of \co{transcendence}:\thi{correspondence} to \co{externality}, \thi{coherence} to the \co{more} ofthe context, \thi{consensus} to the \co{non-mineness} of other humans or culture,and the last one (which does not have any established name nor any strictlyphilosophical tradition) to the revelation of \co{invisibles} and silence of the\co{origin}.The tradition correcting the views which bring truth all too closely tosubjectivity observes that denying any sphere of\co{transcendence}, one denies also the meaning of the word \wo{truth}. Such adenial indeed solves all the problems in one stroke: there is nothing to talkabout. There may be some dose of positive intentions behind such claims. But theword itself refuses irresponsibly to die and, moreover, it refuses even to bereduced to any other word. Perhaps, we are playing our \thi{language game} a bitwrongly? A bit irresponsibly? A bit too ecstatically? A bit too {immanently}?Yet, this tradition (of correspondence theories, or realism) encounters theproblem of dualistic ontology which it can neither ignore nor solve.  To someextent, we follow the opposing tradition (of immanentism, or idealism), namely,to the extent that every \thi{what} is relative to (our) \co{distinguishing}. Inthe world of \co{distinctions}, there is no strict dualism: the {meanings} ofour \co{signs} and the \co{distinctions} with respect to which their truth isconstituted are essentially of the same kind: they are both \co{distinctions} inthe same \co{indistinct}. Almost as Frege demanded of a correspondence that it\citet{can only be perfect if the corresponding things coincide and are,  therefore, not distinct things at all.}{FregeTruth}{p.86. Or, as already  Plotinus observed, albeit with a much more profound reference to human  reality, only with respect to the intellectual realm: \wo{the object known    must be identical with the knowing act [or agent], the    Intellectual-Principle, therefore, identical with the Intellectual Realm.    And in fact, if this identity does not exist, neither does    truth.}$^{\ref{cit:actIsObject}}$}There is, however, a difference between the two in that the \co{actual  distinctions} of mere \co{signs} can  merge into the \co{non-actual}%or \co{external}ones. Our \thi{immanentism} of relativity goes along with the fundamentalimportance of \co{transcendence}, of \co{non-actuality} serving as the measureand corrective of the \co{immanent signs}. We disagree completely with anyreductionistic attempts, with any form of verificationism\ftnt{Later  Wittgenstein's practice seems to have strong pragmatic roots, and  verificationism is a recurring theme. \citef{Rather, we must first determine    the role of deciding for or against a proposition.

It has both aspects of verificationism \citef{Truth \la{ante rem}    means only {\em verifiability} [...]}{JamesTruth}{p.61} and utilitarianism,  according to which truth \citef{is distinguished from falsehood simply by    this, that if acted on it should, on full consideration, carry us to the    point we aim at and not astray}{PierceFix}{5}% \citef{To \thi{agree} in the widest sense with a reality {\em can only mean to%     be guided either straight up to it or into its surroundings, or to be put in%     such working touch with it as to handle either it or something connected%     with it better than if we disagreed}.}{JamesTruth}{[p.59]}Unfortunately, as already Russell pointed out, it is not only highly problematicto specify the \thi{point we aim at}; the criterion of eventual \thi{betterness}or usefulness is often useless if one were to use it for determining truth -- itis much easier to ascertain that \wo{snow is white} than to figure out whatmight be the use of such a truth.}%reducing truth to some \co{visible}, preferably observable if not measurable elements ofexperience.  If one wants to insist that \wo{only what serves life is true},then one must also add that \wo{only truth serves life}, if \wo{truth is what it  is expedient to believe in} then also \citet{what is {\em really} true it is  good to believe and evil to reject.}{PierceBerkeley}{[my emph., p.87]}Constructing truth as some ideal limit terminating inquiry,as a regulative idea extending gradually its actual scope, arises from the sameimmanentism, albeit in an attempt to take care of the transcendent aspect as well,adding it, as if at the ideal terminus of interminable sequence. By this addition it really inverts the immanentism and makes thereduction especially well visible: for now no actual, visible and temporal sign can be (considered) true.We get closer to the correspondence theories observing that if truth gets reduced to anycriterion then we have really dispensed with the very idea of truth which isexactly the last norm remaining when all other criteria have been violated.% This is an aspect of the absoluteness of truth -- relativity to the regions of% the world, to the levels of drawing the distinctions and to the degree of% conformance notwithstanding.In particular, along with all criteriology, there disappears also what for itappears as a big problem: the truths which might remain forever unknown.\ftnt{Certainly, our ontology of  relativity to \co{existence}, makes also all truths, except the \co{one},  disappear when no \co{existence} is left. But it does not imply that all the  truths a particular \co{existence} discovers during its life time disappear when this  \co{existence} dies.}  Taking $D$ (in our \thi{definition} \refp{pa:notArbitraryD}.\refeq{eq:truth}) to be \thi{the number   of brontosauruses that ever lived}, then we may meaningfully say that thesentence \wo{The number of brontosauruses that ever lived is precisely 75,278}is true (or false) with respect to  $D$, although we will never know which one it is.We follow the correspondence theory in that truth expresses an agreement:between the \co{immanence} of a \co{sign} and the \co{transcendence} where its\co{meaning} resides. But this agreement is not between two incommensurableelements. Truth is a \co{trace} of \co{transcendence}, of the fact that,eventually, \co{I am not the master}. But this ultimate \co{confrontation} islived as the \co{unity} of \co{actual} and \co{non-actual}, of the\co{distinctions} which reside on both sides of the boundary of \co{actuality}.We do not live in two incommensurable worlds of mental and external affairs --we live in one and the same world emerging through the\co{distinctions} relative to our \co{existence}, which we draw and recognise{\em in} the \co{indistinct}. % : the \co{external} things of the% world are (limits of) such \co{distinctions} and so are our understandings of% them.  Completely different \co{distinctions} will confirm the truth of% \wo{There is a cat on the mat} and of \wo{I love her}, but in both cases these% are \co{distinctions transcending} the \co{immediacy} of the \co{signs} which claim% their presence.% \ftnt{Slightly different \co{distinctions} would need to be present in% the \co{actual} situation to make \wo{There is no cat on the mat}, \wo{There is%   a cat or a dog on the mat} true.% % But this is still trivially something we can% % see, this is still something addressing the perceptually drawn \co{distinctions}% There is no trouble with the logical constants like \wo{not} or \wo{or} for they, too,% amount to drawing the \co{distinctions} in the way peculiar to their meaning.}\pa Besides trying to balance the merits of these two views\noo{(which are contrary onlywhen \co{dissociated})} we have, of course, emphasized that truth depends on thelevel addressed by the \co{signs}.  The relevant \co{aspect} of\co{transcendence} is, except for the highest level, the\co{horizontal transcendence} corresponding to the level of things addressed bythe statements (theories, views) which one wants to judge with respect to theirtruth or untruth.\ftnt{\wo{It is hot} is confronted merely with the immediacy of  the sensation; \wo{There is a cat on the mat} will be confronted with  the \co{actual} facts (as will be \wo{There is no cat on the mat}!); an  elaborate theory will be confronted with observations of its predictable  consequences, with the requirements of internal consistency and, perhaps, of  conformance or commensurability with other accepted theories, etc.; the  general ideas, like \wo{Man is what he leaves behind him}, will be confronted  with other, similarly general ideas, with the personality of one who  pronounces them, with the pronouncements of others and, eventually, with the  personal intuitions and convictions.} And so, even if we grant someplausibility at the level at which the respective theories operate, they hardlyretain it with respect to the lower, or higher levels. The kind of theory oftruth one is able to propose depends primarily on the kind of things addressed,because things of different levels are involved in different forms of\co{transcendence}.Thus truth borrows its specific character from the things addressed but it isall the time a \co{trace} of the \co{original confrontation}.  \citet{Thus  veritable truth is not accordance with an external; it is self-accordance; it  affirms and is nothing other than itself and is nothing other; it is at once  existence and self-affirmation.}{Plotinus}{V:5.2} From this \co{original  foundation} it borrows the expectations of addressing something -- and henceitself being -- unchangeable, one and shared by all.  But as long as it isconcerned with relative beings, the truth itself can only be relative; only whatconcerns the \co{absolute} can be \co{absolutely} true.%Relativity of truth means only relativity of all possible \thi{whats}, of theaddressed \co{distinctions}. But given the addressed subject-matter or situation, the truthwith respect to this relative context can be definite and \thi{absolute} -- the\co{actual signs} can conform fully to the addressed \co{distinctions}, therelation between S and D, as indicated in \refp{pa:truth}.\refeq{eq:truth}, isperhaps the matter of degree but not of any relativity. \co{Above} all relative \thi{whats}, the \co{absolute} truth is only the ultimate \co{that}, the reminder \co{that}there is (truth) which can be expressed and manifested but never captured andexhausted by any \co{actuality}.  Truths of the lower levels need not conform tosuch absolute standards. The lower need not mimic the higher, need notattempt any similarity, for this is impossible. But it must not forget thehigher either, for then correct observations can turn into false ideas, truepropositions can turn into false theories, correct arguments into wrong causesand series of right decisions into disastrous mystifications. Truth, let us say,is a \co{concrete participation} in the \co{traces} of \co{transcendence}, andas there are different forms and levels of \co{transcendence}, so truth of alower level may turn out to be a falsehood of a higher one.  Truths which stopshort of the \co{absolute} remain relative, and this is a common lot. But ifthey forget it, if they forget the \co{absolute}, they start imperceptibly toclaim absoluteness for themselves and thus turn into falsehoods.  \citeti{Your eye  is the lamp of your body.

It is insecurity about the meaning which  creates insecurity about truth. One can always bring in new aspects and claim  their relevance, one can always differentiate further the meaning -- sceptics  have almost unlimited field of maneuver.    It is trivialities of the kind \thi{Snow is white} which serve as the most  stable and irresistible examples of truths because they relate to the most  obvious and common reference frame of perception.\ftnt{It may be telling to    observe that crucial examples used by Russell in his (in our opinion, mostly    adequate) critique of other theories of truth (like pragmatism in    \citeauthor*{RussellPrag}, coherentism in \citeauthor*{RussellTruth}) are    precisely of this kind.}    \ad{Coher/consensus} Reduction to verification leads naturally to some form of  coherentism. Truth refuses to be reduced completely to merely immanent  dimension as this would signify also its reduction to subjectivity, while the  intuition that truth is the \co{trace} of \co{transcendence} in our  \co{actuality} is hard to ignore. Coherence with a wider scope of \thi{truths}  takes over the role of transcendence in relation to every single \thi{truth}.  Whether it is coherence within the verification community (as Pierce, James or  newer French sociologism), or else within the set of mutually  supporting/verifying truths (Pierce, Quine, Wittgenstein (?)) is only a ...    Consensus gives a mystical power to a community. It may have such a power but  not with respect to truth, only with respect to falsehood. Truth by consensus  is dependent on common acceptance, giving consent to it. We can imagine some  legal ways of consenting (passing laws, etc.), but these do not extend to the  domain of truth (at most, they may falsify truth). This is so, because  community does not consent in the same way as individual does... Nobody will  claim that we may have a case where the community consents to No while all  individuals to Yes (or vice versa). In fact, here communal consensus consists  exclusively of the consensus given by every single (involved, or for other  reasons eligible) individual    \ad{Deflationary}\label{pa:deflation} Deflationary\ftnt{We do not    differentiate between the possible variants of deflationism (minimalism,    redundancy theory, reductivism, etc.), as they seem to share the features    which are relevant to ur discussion.} no theory, jut reduce truth to meaning  (with no meaning theory, deflationary is empty, and says only that all `truth'  is needed for are indirect references -- this, however, is no theory of  `truth').

In the  sentence \wo{~\wo{Snow is white} is true.} the \thi{is true} appears as a  second (or higher) order predicate applicable to the sentences. In a sense, it  is exactly what happens when hearing that snow is white we are asking if it is  true. But the whole point is the meaning of this last phrase, is the questionabout what it means for a %(let's say) first-ordersentence to be true.%% Notice that here quotation marks can be put only around the whole thing:% \wo{..for first-order sentence to be true} and not as above, \wo{... for%   \wo{first-order sentence} to be true.} We know (or, to be pedantic in the% truly pseudo-scientific manner, let's say), we all assume that (all, or at least% some)%Most expressions of the language relate to something extra-linguistic, no matterwhat it is, let us talk about as \wo{the world}. We thus have the startingpoint, where X is some \co{sign}, probably a sentence \equ{X -----?------ the  world \label{eq:defA}} The self-referential capabilities of the language allowus to express -- or rather to refer to -- this relation within the language.Thus we can say things like \equ{The sentence \wo{X} has the relation \wo{?} to  \wo{the world}\label{eq:defB}} All deflationists are able to claim is that inmost cases (when, as already Tarski observed, the \wo{Sentence X} is givendirectly) the meaning of \wo{?} in (\ref{eq:defB}) is the same as the meaning of? in (\ref{eq:defA}). They kill a paper tiger of a higher-order,intra-linguistic definitionalism. The real question -- namely what is ? in(\ref{eq:defA}) -- remains untouched.  Deflationism wants to claim that, sincethe higher-order statement (\ref{eq:defB}) means the same as the lower-order one($X$ in (\ref{eq:defA})), the whole issue of the relation ? disappears.Unfortunately, our primary interest is not in which propositions \wo{X} are true-- we are interested in true propositions.  As Ramsey observes, \citet{the  problem is [...]  as to the nature of judgment or assertion [...

But this stillleaves the whole problem (of the relation ?) open!  We can here agree with theobservation that \citet{once it is allowed that the role of \thi{true} is to  mark a particular kind of achievement, or failing, on the part of a  proposition, contrasting with its being warranted or not, there will have to  be decent sense in the question, what does such an achievement, or failing,  amount to?}{CrispinTruth}{p.215} Formally, it may be that \citet{the truth  predicate is the device of disquotation}{QuineTruth}{p.13}, but this is onlyan expression of the semantic ascent, that even when we move to expressions of ahigher-order form, we are still interested primarily in the objective referenceto the world.Dubious affair of: we can't say what it is -- so, we do not know what it is --so, let's be pragmatic, we do not need it -- so, let's remove it} %end \noo Consensus...\noo{ Logic in the broad sense is a part of rhetoric, is a part of the art of  speaking.

This is, indeed, thefundamental relation but not the only one. As we have noticed contrasting\co{invisibles} and \thi{forms} in \ref{sub:formMatter}, and then discussingmemory in \refpf{pa:memovirt}, there is also a flow bottom-up, in which\co{actuality} influences the \co{invisible distinctions} and contribute toformation of more \co{virtual nexuses}.\noo{The \thi{bowed serial position curve} occurs when people are asked to  remember a list of items (e.g., numbers), given {\em one} at a time. Most  people tend to remember well the items from the beginning and from the end,  but not from the middle, even though at the moment of the actual stimulus  (each item) the subject does not know when the list is going to end.  Surely,  these two `events' constitute a \co{cut} as they are more significant than the  items in, and in particular in the middle of the list. They are more  significant because, among other things, the subjects {\em are told} what's  going to happen, that they will be given a list whose end will occur without  any warning. This foreknowledge certainly plays a role in identifying -- and  hence also remembering -- the end of the list, once it occurs.% Fetching the most recent items from the memory may be ascribed to their presence% in retention, from which the middle items have been expunged.    eventually, one will remember only that there was a list which had beginning  and end\ldots But is this last (that it had beginning and end) something one  {\em remembers}? One may forget {\em how} it started and ended, but hardly  {\em that} it did\ldots This may seems backward-projection }\pa\label{acts} \co{Acts} are limited to the \hoa\ in that the unity of a single\co{act} is consummated within this horizon, with the \equi\ \co{aspects} of the\co{actual object} and \co{actual subject}.  But, of course, we do not \co{act}in a completely spontaneous, that is, \co{dissociated} and meaningless way.Every \co{act} has a \co{rest}, is anchored in a wider context.  The unity of acomplex of \co{acts}, of an \co{action} or even \co{activity} is constituted notby their \co{objects} (they may vary and change) but by their \ldots well,objectives, \co{motivations}, eventually, \co{inspirations}.  An \co{object} ofan \co{act} follows (is chosen by) the purpose of the \co{action}; the purposeof the \co{action} follows the \co{motive} of the \co{activity}; and\co{motives}, often life-long \co{motivations} and traits, are in turn\co{expressions} of the \co{inspirations}.%Provided, that everything is fine.Thus, like every \co{actual experience}, an \co{act} is a cut through and out ofthe sphere of \co{experience}, across all levels of one's being, in particular,across the sphere of \co{visibility} as well as \co{invisibility}.  The\co{invisible} limit is, eventually, the \co{one} which is \co{present} onlyalong with the cuts through all the intermediate levels.  The \co{presence}influenced by the \co{act} can never be its intentional \co{object}.  To theextent \co{I} try to make it such, it withdraws and changes its character.  Inthe most trivial cases, if \co{I} think \wo{I have to learn swimming.  I have to  learn swimming\ldots} while trying to follow the instructions, \co{I} willhave very hard time.  The best \co{I} can do is to concentrate on following theinstructions.  If the intention of \co{my act} is \thi{to be good}, \co{I} mayhappen to do a fine thing, but the \co{invisible aspect} of the \co{act} hasthen withdrawn beyond the horizon of this intention and brought forth somethingmore than what was intended.  (Probably, what motivated \co{me} in the firstplace {\em to try} to be good.)  It is not that \co{I} am not conscious of what,eventually, hides behind my \co{acts} -- it is only that \co{I} {\em can not  possibly} make it \co{reflectively actual}, in any case not in the \co{act}itself.  This \co{rest} of every \co{act} is the witness, on the one hand, ofits anchoring in the wider sphere of my being and, on the other, of \co{act}'spossibility to influence it.\noo{What happens is entirely analogous to what we have seen with memories  retreating into the sphere of \co{virtuality}.  The contents of \co{acts} (and  this means, the full contents, both the \co{objective}, \co{visible} and the  hidden \co{invisible} motivation and background) are engraved in the memory  and, gradually, influence the structure of the \co{invisible} sphere.  It is  however crucial that, although each \co{act} is associated with the sphere of  \co{invisibles}, such associations are thoroughly personal.  Statistically,  one may and one does attempt some classifications, but it is never certain if  the \co{acts} commonly known to produce desirable effects on the person will  do so for a given individual.  \co{Vague} generalities are all we may expect  from impersonal descriptions and general theories.  }\pa A trivial example can be formation of more and more advanced \co{concepts}.One will usually start with a very rough and simplified understanding ofsomething, but by prolonged study one's \co{concepts} will be refined.  Onetends to confirm it only by observing an increased ability to solve \co{actual}problems, perhaps, to relate various aspects and provide more sophisticated\co{actual} descriptions.  But it is not so that more knowledge gets simplyaccumulated as separate pieces in a big sack.  With the possible exception ofphotographic memory, a person forced to memorise more will also form more orless explicit structures for arranging the increasing amount of facts.  More{\em or less} explicit!  The less explicit ones may not be accessible toobservation or introspection but, the claim is, they are formed nevertheless.Arranging mathematical or strictly formalised knowledge in such a way, one willtypically identify more central results and theorems which allow one to derivesecondary results.  But this is only a plain \co{visible} analogy.  Arrangingless formalised knowledge and memories, one will also develop structures whichresearches on memory try to unveil.  For our part it is only the most rough andgeneral of such structures which is interesting -- the structure of\thi{compressing} a manifold of \co{actualities} into a more unified \nexus,perhaps, gathering them under the unifying \co{sign} of a \co{concept}.We are not talking here only about memory in the common sense of the word, forthe \thi{compressed} \co{actualities} can, in fact, slip out of memory.  Butthey have contributed their part to the formation of something which we mightidentify with a \co{virtual} center.  We have indicated a generic example ofsuch a process when discussing memory and possible transition of \co{actual}events to \co{virtuality}, \refpf{pa:memovirt}.  In the case of \co{conceptual}constructions, this can manifest itself as the acquired ability to \thi{intuit}a large number of related problems in {one} \co{act} (called often an \wo{act of  intuition}, but what matters to us is only that it is {\em one} \co{act}).Prolonged and dedicated study of an area leads to a {\em development of  intuition}, to the state where a person is able to grasp, in one \co{act}, avariety of aspects and to know that and how these aspects are related and mightbe \co{actualised}. \citet{The successful practice of intuition requires  previous study and assimilation of a multitude of facts and laws. We may take  it that great intuitions arise out of matrix of  rationality.}{IdealistView}{V:1.\kilde{p.139} Although intuition as described  above concerns only unity of \co{visible complexes}, the mechanism of the  great and deep intuitions, which are the primary concern of Radhakrishnan,  seems to be of the same kind.}  The same happens when learning some skills,like swimming.  At first, every movement has to be consciously attended andactively controlled.  It is only through repetition and exercise that I, orrather my body, \thi{gets it}, that all the movements, their sequences andmutual relations converge into an intrinsic and organised whole.%the same on \co{concepts} (built botom-up) and other%\co{actual distinctions} which \thi{infect} feelings and higher signs;%acts \ldots Shall we also include prayer, acts of compassion, etc. for %building up the attitude of \yes?%\tsep{\co{Actual} influence ?}\pa Now, such processes happen not only when we try to learn something but alsowhen we do not.  The level to which the involved \co{actualities} can be broughtmay vary, but the idea is the same -- they get organised, or disorganised, theyget stored for an easy access in long term memory, or they get \thi{forgotten}.As they \thi{move upwards}, they enter various (and hardly recognisable)complexes and, eventually, disappear in \co{virtuality}.  But although they may thus disappear in their \co{actual} form, they areretained in the \co{invisible} centers to the formation of which they havecontributed.In such a process, \co{invisible} centers can be formed, from which it may beimpossible to extract the \thi{original parts}.  This can be exemplified, forinstance, by the subconscious formation of complexes (in the Jungian sense ofthe word) or other subconscious processes which analysis may only try to bringforth again. Saying that \wo{time heals all wounds} we refer to quite the sameprocess of \thi{covering up} or, perhaps, \thi{suppressing} some\co{experiences} by a long series of \co{actualities}. The original experienceand its memory seldom will disappear, but they can gradually dissolve, lose thepossibly violent or damaging potential, in an aura of works and days which forceman to focus on other things. Education and upbringing of children offer innumerable examples.  \citt{Sow an  action, and you reap a habit; sow a habit, and you reap a character; sow a  character, and you reap a destiny.}{James \citaft{Cotkin}{p.69}} True, butwhich action will lead to what habit, which habit to what character, etc., arethings which we can only approximate in general terms.  \citet{When a man dwells  on the pleasures of sense, attraction for them arises in him. From attraction  arises desire, the lust of possession, and this leads to passion, to anger.  From passion comes confusion of mind, then loss of remembrance, the forgetting  of duty\ldots}{Bhagavad}{II:62-62} Plausibility of such observations dependsalways on more specific and personal aspects and traits which determine\co{concretely} what is and what is not \wo{dwelling}, \wo{lust}, etc.Apocryphal stories describing childhood of a saint or a hero are exactlyreflections of such a rough and general understanding of the ways lower eventsand actual experiences accumulate into higher traits of character andpersonality, even if they usually reflect the only form under which such\co{invisible} processes are \co{actually visible}, namely, as a\thi{predetermined destiny}, as being \thi{marked by the gods}.  Dependency on the \co{concrete} personal traits is reflected by the fact thateach step upwards requires, of course, time.  A single event or \co{act} hasseldom deep consequences, and repetition of prescribed \co{acts} may even haveconsequences quite opposite to the intended ones.  For between any two controlled\co{acts}, many others happen, and even if the person does not \co{act}, hestill \co{experiences}.  Very few are lucky enough to have a wise tutor who isable to give a constant, personal advice.  For the most, we learn and acquireour habits and character through roughly accidental interaction with parents, family andimmediate surroundings.  Which, for the most, means, we do not acquire muchcharacter and even less destiny.  Again statistically, the less advice, controland guidance in upbringing, the less strength and character, that is, unity ofthe personal being.  For loose and free confrontation with the indefinite, perhapsonly freely chosen, objectives, as many a pedagogue would say nowadays, the\wo{promotion of independence and individual creativity} by avoiding obstaclesand high demands, breed perhaps individualism but hardly individuality.%de-individualised individuals.Tedious work, perhaps boring work is, more often than not, a blessing whichteaches a young person more than superficial overstimulation.  But sure,whatever happens will have an influence on the habits, character, perhaps evendestiny.  We always get what we sow, but we hardly ever know what we are sowing.\wo{We live forward, but we understand backward} says Kierkegaard and deep wisdom,which is also knowledge of the future, is a rare exception.  It requires, aboveall, the acquaintance not only with the seeds one uses to sow but also the soilinto which they are sown.  For \co{acts} and \co{actual experiences} are alwaysimmersed into the \co{invisible} sphere of \co{concrete} personality and statistics may be helpful but will never suffice.\noo{\wo{She does not seem to love me any more.

A goodadvice may be something I just did not realise but recognise once it is given.But more profoundly, a good advice tells me to do something which I do notunderstand, something I am {\em not able} to understand.  It tells me to act ina way which I do not know whereto leads.  Surely, one has to have a lot trust inthe person to follow such an advice.  But if it was a wise advice, I will learnonce I arrive, because acting in the recommended way (and if heavens so wish)will eventually lead to a new \co{unity}, if not to the place I had imagined andwished, so in any case to a new resting place. Wisdom is the capacity to give agood advice which, like a teacher's knowledge and instruction, transcends thehorizon of the one who is in need of it. Transcending this horizon means hereexactly that it knows the effects of accumulated activity over time, that it isnot restricted to the mere \co{actuality}.Ontological \co{founding} of lower levels by the higher ones does not concernany specific contents but only the general structure and character of eachlevel. The influence of the lower levels on the higher ones, on the other hand,concerns specific contents, like bringing up a particular (kind of) person,developing particular (kinds of) skills. We will consider such a more specificrelation between the contents of various levels in the following Book.

The current Book does not presentepistemology as any \thi{theory of knowledge} guaranteeing any certainties andresolving all doubts or -- what appearing more modest is even more presumptuous-- offering a method for resolving doubts which might possibly arise. Ourepistemology (if epistemology it is) addresses only the general ways of meeting\co{transcendence} and its \co{actual reflections}. The search for truth and theineradicable conviction that it not only means something but also is better thanfalsehood, is only one special form of this fundamental \co{thirst} \co{founded}in the \co{awareness} of the insufficiency of \co{visibility}; curiosityor fascination, confusion or boredom, bafflement and even despair, areothers and all can occur in various combinations with each other.  Ourepistemology (if epistemology it is) presents only some \co{reflections} which might help maintaining the continuitybetween the \co{actual} contents and their \co{transcendent} origins, thetension without which \co{dissociated actuality} turns into dull emptiness devoid of the sense of meaning and reality.  Scientific activity canbe an expression of such a confusion or curiosity, but questions about the \co{actual}scientific contents, the \co{actual} results of \co{objectivistic}reductions, do not have much to do here.\noo{Usually (though not too often),  only the most prominent researchers in some field reach the experience of the  field's fundamental limitations.  Ignoring the outsiders, it usually takes a  most prominent scientist to express the genuine concern about the fundamental  meaning of science and its (in)capacity to diffuse this meaning.}Yet, this digression has its reason.  Mathematics has always held a particularplace among the sciences.  Indeed, to such an extent that most other sciencestry desperately to approach mathematical standards (sometimes for better,usually, for worse).  Good reasons for the prominence of mathematics can bediscerned at the level of abstraction at which we are moving.  One shouldn'tprobably go as far as to say that the beauty and purity of mathematics have, inthemselves, existential import. But they are reflections of the spiritual dimensionof \co{existence} in the degree unmatched by any other science. The \la{a priori}character of mathematical objects and constructions makes one suspect, if not\co{clearly recognise}, the ultimately\co{transcendent} origin of mathematical truths.Discussing truth, %in \ref{sub:truth},we related occasionally its levels to various forms of mathematical logic(\refp{pa:logicA}, footnotes~{\small{\ref{ftnt:locales}, \ref{ftnt:logicB},\ref{ftnt:logicC}, \ref{ftnt:logicD}}}.) Wewould have to agree that such a {classification} is a bit arbitrary.  Formalityof logical systems allows one to mix variousnotions, like negation, disjunction, as well as semantical constructions, andapply them across all the levels.  And this is so because mathematical systemsdo not describe things, feelings, actual perceptions, but uniform mathematicalobjects. They may be motivated by extra-mathematical considerations but onceformulated they become part of mathematics. One mathematical theory canpostulate complex mathematical objects vastly different from thosepostulated by another such theory.But to the extent they are both {\em mathematical} they address, eventually, basicmathematical objects and therefore, can be related to each other.The question concerns not the detailed choices but the fundamental issue: whatis the relation (if any) between a logical, or generally, mathematical systemand extra-mathematical reality?  What are the ultimate objects of mathematics,and what, if any, is their relation to experience?% We will address these questions relying again on the general conviction that% unity of \co{actual} differences is seldom, if ever, to be found in the% \co{actual} state of affairs, in the affairs of \co{actuality}, but rather in% their emergence from a \co{virtuality} of an origin.\paIn every science one finds the hard seed of pre-scientific reality and beautiful flowers of scientific imagination. The former, the origin, is rooted in our intuition and \co{experience}. As the virtual origin it neither contains all possible details of future results nor determines the ways in which science can develop. It only precedes any such development, lies beyond and before it, and lends its basic notions some intuitive content which can be appealing even to the uninitiated laymen.%\ftnt{Derrida Introduction to OG: origin ``sends'' its inspiration... to       %which one tries to return in the zigzag...}Origin is not a foundation. In fact, laying down a foundation marks already adefinitive break with the origin. It amounts to internalising the originalintuitions in terms of a language which from now on will develop according toits own standards. We do not want to review the arguments between formalists,Platonists, intuitionists, etc. We do not even want to see the differencesbetween classical and non-classical mathematics, between geometry, arithmetics,algebra, topology, etc. Such distinctions involve one into mathematicalarguments. The question about origin is, on the contrary, the question aboutwhat makes all these branches into branches of one and the same mathematics,what makes the results of Pythagoras, Fibonacci, Viete, Riemann, Cantor equallymathematical.Quine's statement that a (mathematical) theory commits one to the ontologydetermined by the range of bound variables, is certainly very clear andconvincing.  Indeed, the entities a theory describes are those which can witnessto the truth of the existential statements -- \wo{there exists an $x$ such  that\ldots} Any particular, not only mathematical, theory has to specify suchentities.  But our point is very different. As we will argue, any mathematicaltheory addresses, eventually, only one kind of entities.  As remarked above inconnection with various logics -- differences of modeled phenomena andmotivations notwithstanding, they are all {\em mathematical} logics.  Quine'sontology -- the range of bound variables -- is still entirely\co{objectivistic}. The theory represents epistemological apparatus which dealswith particular entities, that is, a particular ontology. One is concernedexclusively with the objects explicitly treated by the theory, and these areobjects defined already {\em within} a mathematical world. As such, one does notat all address the issue of origin but at most of foundation and, in fact, amuch more specific issue of differences between the local ontologies of varioustheories or formalisms.  Asking about the origin of mathematics we will not beconcerned with such issues at all; we are not asking what objects can possiblybe constructed mathematically but, on the contrary, what primary objects giverise to the mathematical constructions. The origin of such objects willbe found at the very first stages of differentiation, in the sphere whereontology has not as yet got dissociated from epistemology.\subsection{What is a point?} %-- pure distinction} \pa\label{pa:pointA} \citet{A point is that which has no part.}{Elements}{I,  Def.1} It is the residual unity \citet{beyond which there cannot be anything  less.}{DDI}{I:5/13} Intuition of a point is the same as the intuition of a\thi{substance}, of a purely \co{actual object}, which is the mere site of itsself-identity, that is, a point.  It is like the least something which still is,the least something from which nothing can be removed without removing the thing(that is, the point) itself. Evanescent site of pure \co{immediacy}\ldotsNow, it might seem that to come from \co{actually} given \co{objects} tomathematical points there is a need for abstraction, since an \co{actual object}is always a particular thing with all its properties, while point is only theresidual site with no properties whatsoever. It might seem that a point resultsfrom a process of abstraction in which \citet{we obtain from each object a more  and more bloodless phantom.  Finally we thus obtain from each object a  something wholly deprived of content; But the something obtained from one  object is different from the something obtained from another object -- though  it is not easy to say how\ldots}{FregeHusserl}{} It might indeed seem so, butonly when we assume that \co{objects} are the only original givens and thattheir givenness is a primitive, simple \co{immediacy}. Then, indeed, anythinglacking in some \co{actual} content seems to arise from the \co{actual} givensonly by abstraction.\pa But \co{objects} are not the original givens. On the contrary, \co{objects}are abstractions from the \co{concreteness} of \co{experience}, results of aninterplay of \co{distinctions} within the \hoa.  Consequently, the process of\co{founding} does not proceed from \co{objects} towards their \wo{bloodless  phantoms}, for these phantoms are there, are given along with the \co{objects}themselves.  An appearance of an \co{object} is equivalent with the narrowing ofthe \hoa\ to \co{immediacy} which \co{dissociates} some \co{distinctions} fromtheir background.  The apparent independence of \co{objects}, not only from the\co{subject} but also from each other, the fact that \wo{something obtained from  one object is different from the something obtained from another object,} isthe result of this isolation.What precedes, in the order of \co{founding}, appearance not only of\co{objects} but of anything whatsoever is \co{distinction}.  And as in \co{any  experience}, its whole structure, that is, its whole \co{foundation} is also\co{experienced} in the \co{immediate self-consciousness}: \co{distinguishing}particular contents we also \co{experience} (even though not thematically) thevery fact of \co{distinguishing}.Furthermore, even if there are no rigid \co{distinctions}, that is, no sharpboundaries \co{distinguishing} \co{precisely} and univocally one content fromanother, the fact of their \co{distinctness} is given sharply and\co{precisely}.  Just as one can be uncertain where one stripe of a rainbow endsand another begins, so one is certain that they are different stripes, that eachhas, if not a sharp boundary, then in any case some kernel which is distinctfrom the kernel of another stripe.  The mere, yet quite fundamental, fact of\co{distinguishing}, with the immediate awareness of definite distinctness, is \co{pure distinction}.  It has the same character as the pure \co{precision} ofgivenness of an \co{object}, its mere \thi{being there}, in the \co{immediacy}of \co{reflection that it is}.%\thesisnonr{Intuition of a point is the same as the intuition of a \co{pure    distinction}.}~\ftnt{\thi{Intuition} here should not be taken in a thetic  sense, as an \thi{intuition of\ldots}, positing some \co{object} \thi{\ldots}.  It is an aspect of \co{an immediate experience}, a \co{non-reflective},  non-positional \co{self-consciousness} of the structure of \co{the actual    experience}.  Such an intuition, a \thi{point-awareness} is the same as the  \thi{\co{pure distinction}-awareness}.    This identification can seem to go counter our differing images of the  two: point is a mere dot $\cdot$, while distinction a line $|$  splitting the space in two. But these are only pictures. We could bring them  closer, for instance, if we imagined distinction as a circle $\circ$ (still  splitting the space in two, cf.~I:\refp{th:cut}). Since no distinction is  rigid, the exact   circumference of the circle is blurred. But this does not make the fact of it  being made less clear -- the fact which we could imagine as the point at the  center of the circle. So understood, \co{pure distinction} corresponds to the  neo-Platonic monad responsible (albeit always in a very unclear way) for the  generation of actual numbers. \citef{The cause is in it [monad], and they    [numbers] are causally in it because it subsists as the beginning of all    numbers. [...] intelligible numbers are so poured out from the monad that    in some way they become clear in the mind; next flowing out from mind to    reason [...]}{Periphy}{III;p.172} \citef{In the case of numbers, the unit    remains intact while something else produces, and thus number arises in    dependence on the unit: [...] there is, primarily or secondarily, some form    or idea from the monad in each of the successive numbers -- the latter still    participating, though unequally, in the unit [...]}{Plotinus}{V:5.5}  Distinction between monad generating the numbers and The One is maintained but  never entirely clear.  (Eriugena calls even Creator a Monad: \citefib{Monad    which is sole Cause and Creator of all things visible and invisible [vs.]    created monad in which all numbers always subsist causally, uniformly, and    according to their reasons, and from which they emerge in many    forms.}{Periphy}{III;p.172-3}) Very close conceptual associations between  the two are handled by more or less intricate hierarchies of (degrees of)  units, like The One, monad, henad, henads, etc., into which we will not  inquire.  }Consequently, no abstraction is needed to arrive at a point, \citet{we have a  direct awareness of mathematical form as an archetypal structure.}{LawsForm}{  Introduction; p.xxiv\label{cit:numberArchetyp}} It is a structure present in any apprehension of an\co{object}, an \co{aspect} of \co{any actual experience} and as such is itself\co{experienced}.\pa True, abstraction may be needed to posit a point as an \co{actual object},to \co{reflectively} isolate this \co{aspect} of \co{an experience}.  But this doesnot change the fact that it is an \co{aspect} of every \co{experience} and emerges fromthere only as a result of \co{reflective} isolation -- it is not a mereconstruction, an empty, or conceptual abstraction.  Taking a point in this way,as an \co{object} of \co{reflection},\noo{Even if advanced \co{reflection}  involves manipulation of \co{signs}, usually artificial \co{signs}, and  construction of complicated models, primarily, it is only abstraction from  \co{experience}, it merely reflects some of its aspects without preserving  others.  In mathematics, \thi{reflection} is a property of a mapping between  structures.  A mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$ \thi{reflects} a property $P$ if  from the fact that $B$ has $P$, $P(B)$, we can conclude that also $P(A)$.  In  general, our \co{reflection} does not have this property, since its function  is to {objectify} and \co{externalise} aspects of \co{experience} which are  not necessarily \co{objective}.  But to the extent \co{reflection} merely  isolates an \co{actual} aspect of \co{experience}, as for instance in  perception, it does have this property.  \thi{Reflection} is dual to  \thi{preservation}: $f$ \thi{preserves} a property $P$ if from the fact that  $P(A)$, we can conclude that also $P(B)$.  Of course, our \co{reflection} does  not enjoy this property.}%we can specialise the above thesis:%\thesisnonr{A point is a \co{representation} of the fact of \co{distinguishing}, of \co{pure distinction}.}\co{Pure distinctness} can be characterised as the fact that points are mutuallyindistinguishable yet distinct, they are distinctions without content,differences without reasons: like the \co{posited} ultimate \thi{substances} or,more \co{concretely}, as the absolute beginnings, identical in so far as themere fact of beginning is concerned, yet distinct by virtue of the absolutenessof true beginning. \co{Pure distinctions} are the fundamental objects of mathematics, the objects which are not results of any mathematical foundation but which mathematics inherits from \co{experience} -- %\thesis{Mathematics is the science of \co{pure distinctions}.}\subsection{Numbers -- multiplicity of distinctions}\paIntroducing us to the notions of number and counting the teacher started to put apples -- one after another -- on the table. ``We have one apple. What happens if I put another apple? Well, now we have two apples. And if I put yet another one? Well,\ldots'' Did not your teacher do a similar thing? What should happen if he run out of apples? What should happen if he suddenlypulled out a pear and put it on the table after a series of apples?  Can youimagine the confusion?  An apple, yet another apple, more apples, a vague patterbegins to emerge and, suddenly, a pear!!  Not that the kids would for ever losethe chance to acquire the concept of number but how much extra work for theteacher!  How would he proceed to explain now that the fact that a pear is notan apple does not matter at all?  How to explain that a pear is simply yetanother object -- a fruit, perhaps -- distinct from all previous ones?  An appleis so much an apple that the sixth apple put on the table is the same as thefifth one -- except that it is the sixth.  A pear after the fifth apple wouldnot be the sixth -- it is too different from the apples.  It would be the firstpear rather than the sixth fruit.  The difference of content would intrude onthe explanation of the \co{pure distinction} of number.We do usually count apples separately from pears.  And if we count both we saywe are counting fruits.  Thus Frege says that \citet{number is the extension of  a concept}{FregeNum}{{\para 68}. Literally: \wo{the number which applies to    the concept $F$ is the extension of the concept <<equinumerous with the    concept $F$>>.}} because as soon as we count quite different objectstogether we seem to subsume them under some common, more general concept.\wo{In fact, we do not ask `How many are Caesar and Pompey and London and  Edinburgh?'~}\ftnt{The idea is, of course, old and renowned. \citef{For reason    counts different things together with things of the same kind, so that    clearly persons are counted with persons, qualities with qualities, and so    forth with other things.}{ClaremTrinitate}{I:\para 46}\kilde{p.31} Ockham  refers to those who similarly, though with a much stronger empirical bias,  \citef{[c]oncerning discrete quantity [...] maintain that number is nothing    but the actual numbered things    themselves.}{OckSumLog}{I:c.xliv}\kilde{p.138}}%In fact, we do not -- but we could!  And counting cities is no different fromcounting cities and persons, counting fruits is no different from countingfruits and houses and the nasty persons one met last week.  Do we then subsumethem under a more general concept? What concept? Insisting on the positiveanswer, we would eventually have to say: the concept of a \thi{mere something},a point, a \co{pure distinction}.Number does not express a \thi{property} of any concept, but rather theunlimited ability to ignore any properties, any conceptual differences ofcontent. It precedes all concepts.\ftnt{We could hardly disagree more with any  empirical reductions of mathematics like those suggested in the previous  footnote. On the contrary, \citef{[w]ise men, indeed, do not say that the    numbers of animals, shrubs, grasses and other bodies or things are related    to the knowledge of the arithmetical art; but they assign to arithmetic only    the intellectual, invisible, incorporeal numbers established in knowledge    alone and not placed substantially in any other    subject.}{Periphy}{III;p.163} One of those wise men (probably unknown to  Eriugena) says: \citef{Where lies the need of [say] decad to a thing which, by    totaling to that power, is decad already?\lin If the Beings preceded the    numbers and this were discerned upon them at the stirring, to such and such    a total, of the numbering principle, then the actual number of the Beings    would be a chance.}{Plotinus}{VI:6.5\lin 10} \citef{[N]umber is proved to be    the beginning of those things that are attained by reason -- proved to such    an extent that if number is removed, then reason shows that none of those    things would remain. [...] Furthermore, it is not the case that any thing    can be prior to number. For all things other than number attest,    necessarily, that there was already number. For all things deriving from    most simple oneness are composed in their own manner. But a composite cannot    be understood in the absence of number...}{CusaCon}{I:2.\para    7-8}\label{ftnt:numberFirst}} Eventually, we count somethings, indeed,points or, to use a synonym, \co{objects}.  The word ``object'' expressesexactly this pure self-identity, empty identity of a noumenal $x$ which isitself simply by not being anything else.  Frege's ``bloodless phantom'' is an\co{object} -- a hardly imaginable site of the ultimate identity of the thing hestarted with.\ftnt{This fundamental importance of distinction is well  illustrated in the logicist's attempts to define numbers. E.g.,  \citeauthor*{CarnapLog}, follows the procedure suggested by Frege: for number  2, one begins by stating that at least two objects fall under a concept $f:  2_m(f) \Leftrightarrow \exists x\ \exists y : x\not = y\land f(x)\land f(y)$.  Then, number 2 is said to apply to a concept $f$ iff: $2_m(f) \land \neg  3_m(f)$.  Identity (or rather its negation, distinctness) needed in the first  part is the undefinable primitive relation of the logical language.}If one wanted to object that apples on the table are not meant as an analogy of\co{pure distinction} because they have different positions, appear on the tableat different times, and so on, that is, because they fall within the extensionof a concept where other differences are needed to distinguish between theobjects, then we would only repeat the question: why do the teachers not countfruits but only apples?  The objection does not change their procedure which is:make the difference as small as physically possible, make the objects so similarthat removing this last amount of difference would erase the distinction itself.If one feels a need for it, one might define the empirical analogue of a\co{pure distinction} as such a smallest possible difference (whatever thatmight mean). \thi{Numerical difference} is the notion corresponding exactly to\co{pure distinction} as distinct from \thi{difference of content}.\pa\label{pa:numbers} But we still have some road to travel before we arrive atnumbers.  For the present, we only have the \thi{numerical difference}. Now, no\co{distinction} occurs alone, there is nothing like \thi{the first  distinction}, only a transition from the undifferentiated \co{one} to thegradually increasing manifold of \co{distinctions}. The \hoa, which is like a\thi{snapshot} of \co{experience}, contains always a multiplicity of\co{distinctions}. Viewing these as \co{pure distinctions}, that is, focusingonly on this \co{aspect} of \co{an actual experience} which determines the meredistinctness of \co{actual} contents, yields the intuition of a propermultiplicity, that is, multiplicity of \co{pure distinctions}. Each \co{actual  experience} is also \co{an experience} of such a multiplicity. This is wellreflected in the most primitive, unary notation for numbers, which merely marksthe \co{distinctions}: I, II, III,\ldots or even better $\bullet$,$\bullet\bullet$, $\bullet\bullet\bullet$,\ldots%\pa\label{pa:ordering}Multiplicity as mere distinctness of the \co{actual} contents, as the  \co{immediate self-cons\-cious\-ness} of \co{pure distinctions}, is the experientialorigin of a set. It is not yet a number which brings us already closer to apossible foundation.  What makes a number into a number is not any mysticalquality but its relations to other numbers\ftnt{\citeauthor*{Benacer}}and an elaboration of such relations is already a matter of mathematical\co{reflection}.  Let us only sketch the most elementary beginning which followsfrom the origin, from the \co{experience} of \co{pure distinctions} and theirmultiplicites.A primitive shepherd who not only cannot count but does not even have aslightest idea of a number, had probably proceeded something like that.  Tocheck if all his many sheep return in the evening from the pasture, he let themout in the morning one by one, marking each leaving sheep as a cut on a stick.In the evening, he let them in one by one, marking each entering sheep on thesame stick, with another mark next to, or across, one of the marks made in themorning.  If every morning mark is matched by one evening mark, everything isOK.  If, however, some morning marks remain unmatched by any evening mark, somesheep are missing.The shepherd performs the most natural, in fact, the only possible operation onecan perform on two \co{actual} multiplicities -- he relates them by associatingpoints in one with those in the other.  He does it in a particular way servinghis particular purpose: he matches each evening mark with only one, but alwaysdistinct, morning mark -- he establishes an injective relation (indeed, afunction) from evening marks to morning marks.  If this happens to be alsosurjective (every morning mark gets matched by one evening mark), then theconclusion is that the multiplicities of sheep in the morning and in the eveningare equal -- there is the same number of sheep.  If the function is notsurjective (some morning marks remain unmatched), the number of returning sheepis less than the number of sheep which left in the morning.  This is thewell-known set-theoretical definition of ordering of cardinal numbers.\ftnt{A  set $A$ has cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of a set $B$, if  and only if there exists an injective function from $A$ to $B$.  They have the  same cardinality if there exists a function which is not only injective but  also surjective (bijective). \citeauthor*{FregeNum}, \para 63, quotes Hume:  \wo{If two numbers are so combined that the one always has a unit which    corresponds to each unit of the other, then we claim they are equal.}}Such an operation is performed not so much on the actual objects (sheep, marks),as on their collections viewed as mere multiplicities of \co{pure distinctions}.Indeed, to pose the problem in the first place, to have the possibility of evenasking the question about {\em all} sheep returning, the shepherd had to\co{recognise} that the relevant aspect is the {\em multiplicity} of {\em  distinct} sheep.  But any multiplicity is proper -- even if one uses someparticular, \co{objective} tokens, it is always multiplicity of \co{pure  distinctions}.The set-theoretical construction of cardinal numbers (as representatives ofclasses of equinumerous sets) is already more than their \co{reflective  experience}. The number 2 does not emerge exclusively as an abstraction fromdifferent collections containing exactly 2 elements.  What would be the basisfor such a generalisation?  It would have to be the notion of \thi{the same  number of elements} in different collections, as set-theory says, of abijective correspondence.  But such a correspondence presupposes that one hasalready abstracted away all differences of content, that all such differences{\em already are ignored}.  The shepherd could not form the idea of representingthe sheep by the marks on his stick, if he did not already have the notion ofthe proper multiplicity of sheep.  The marks on the stick {\em represent}something -- this something are not sheep but their multiplicity.\ftnt{This  should suggest our attitude towards accounts like \btit{The origin of    geometry} in \citeauthor*{Crisis} [Appendix 1; also II:9], which is not  phenomenology of mathematics but of socio-historical emergence of geometry.  One could be tempted to apply a kind of ontological argument (as those quoted  in footnote~\ref{ftnt:numberFirst}) against such and similar approaches which  all repeat, in one form or another, the idea from \citeauthor*{Herodotus},  II:109, that the art of geometry had its origin in the challenge presented by  the Nile to the Egyptians, and only later became an abstract science. But  although \co{origin}, and the \co{original foundation} of mathematics in  particular, exists only through the \co{actual} manifestations (and, one might  want to add, its empirical history), it is in no way dependent on, let alone  reducible to, such manifestations. If \co{pure distinctions} were not given  originally (and originarily) in intuition, if relations of \co{pure    distinctions} were not available to us \la{a priori},\noo{ (that is,    independently from contents of any particular \co{experiences} though not    independently from \co{experience}), } we would never be able to form an  idea, to encounter a phenomenon of, say, a circle. \citef{No [sensuous] image    could ever be adequate to our conception of a [circle] in    general.}{CrPR}{The schematism of the Pure Concepts of    Understanding;A141/B180} A circle, an ideal circle is determined and given  {\em only} by a center, a point, and a radius, that is, {\em equinumerous    multiplicites} separating each point of the circumference from the center.  It could never arise as an abstraction from experiences, or as a repeatable  correlate of acts, in short, as a perfected \ger{Limesgestalt} of imperfect  circles, no matter how often encountered in nature.  (What would determine the  direction of such a generalisation, of such a \wo{conceivable perfecting    \thi{again and again}\ldots}? Husserlian \thi{repeatability} may be,  perhaps, taken as a characterisation of ideality, but it is only a  characterisation founded upon this ideality and not other way around.)  We  could, perhaps, by accident come across and use flat objects which rotate and  roll, but we would never invent a wheel.  Because wheel is not a  generalisation of round objects.  It is a circle, an ideal circle (even if in  practice it is not) which could not be even thought without the relations of  number and equality of multiplicites. }%%% chekc again `repeatability'\newp \pa It shouldn't be necessary to go any further, since we already have the basisfor a number system: multiplicites of \co{pure distinctions} (various\thi{numbers}) and the basics of an ordering relation between them.  The rest isleft for the creative imagination of the mathematicians. As the famous saying ofKronecker's goes: \wo{God created the natural numbers, the rest is the work of  man.}\ftnt{Although we can accept this remark, we would never draw from it  Kronecker's conclusion, anticipating the early XX-th century's focus on  finitary methods (whether of logical axiomatizations, constructivism or  computability theory), that only finitely and explicitly constructible objects  are legitimate mathematical entities.} In fact, a number system consisting of twonumbers only: 1, \thi{many}, contains already all essential features.\citet{The Tououpinambos [native Americans I have spoken with] had no names for  numbers above 5; any number beyond that they made out by showing their  fingers, and the fingers of others who were present.}{LockUnd}{II:16.6.  It is  interesting to observe that Locke speaks about \thi{names} of numbers.  The  Indians obviously had understanding of numbers larger than 5 for which they  only did not have names. Cf. also \citeauthor*{SavageMind},  \citeauthor*{Hartner}.}  Anthropologists report the existence of tribes whosewhole number system contains only four numbers: 1, 2, 3, \thi{many}.  Themathematics one can do with such a system is rather poor but it is {\em  mathematics}, it is a number system.  Although it remains still in a virtualform close to the experiential origin, it involves already the essentialintuitions on which also more advanced number systems are based.\subsection{Infinity} %...  -- Chaos} \pa Thus point is a \co{reflection} of \co{pure distinction}, the \co{pure  immediacy}, while number, initially as mere multiplicity, is the corresponding\co{representation} of simultaneity in terms of \co{pure distinctions}.  Comparisonof multiplicites, not to mention the total ordering relation, are more advancedconstructions which bring us already close to a possible foundation. Just like apoint is a purely \co{actual}, \co{immediate experience}, this intuition of anumber, of multiplicity, is consummated fully within the \hoa. Even if sheepenter the farm over some period of time, no time is involved in the fact ofhaving a given multiplicity of them.Now, just like \co{distinctions} do not come alone, so the numbers do not appearseparately. There is no \co{recognition} of a single number without {\em all}other numbers being given around it. Just like \co{distinctions} emerge in themidst of \co{chaos}, so numbers emerge in the midst of infinity.Just like \co{transcendence} is an \co{aspect} accompanying every\co{actuality}, so infinity is an \equi\ \co{aspect} of multiplicity itself. Itis not some late and advanced addition to the simple intuition of finite number.For instance, it is not only a consequence of, say, positional number notation,where generation of ever greater numbers is a matter of a mechanical principle.In the system with four numbers: 1, 2, 3, \thi{many}, the last one does play therole of infinitely large number, it comprises everything which is \thi{more than  3}. In the Roman number system, instead of \wo{three} one had \wo{thousand};names for numbers greater than thousand were compound expressions of which thehighest component was \wo{thousand}. Roman notation for numbers made it hard, orrather simply impossible, to write arbitrarily large numbers.\ftnt{So did the  Greek notation, from which the Roman one developed. One can certainly see here  the possible impediment in developing more advanced number theory or algebra,  which the Greeks learnt mostly from the Babylonians whose positional notation,  as well as number theory, was vastly superior. Even the primitive concept of a  number which, with the Greeks, included only positive integers and rationals  -- while with the Babylonians it included irrational numbers (if treated only  by means of linear approximations) and, at least from the Seleucid period,  also zero -- might be referred to the notational insufficiencies. But these  are already considerations of the foundations, not of the origin.} But itwould not be plausible to conclude from this that Romans did not have the ideaof an infinity of numbers, although the \co{precision} of this idea might leavemuch to be desired.  The problem was observed already by some Romans, asexemplified in \citeauthor*{Arithmetica}, where the ambitions of arithmetic areexpressedly limited to low numbers, preferably below 9000. But even such alimitation concerned only the correctness of calculation and not the universe ofnumbers.  The question \wo{Is there the biggest number?}  is almost as naturalas \wo{Is there any limit to the distinctions we make?} or, perhaps, \wo{Is the  world infinite?}.\wtsep{potential infty}\pa It may seem that the basic intuition of infinity comes in the form ofpotentiality, with perhaps the most obvious experiential counterpart being\co{more} of \co{complexes}. It is easy to imagine that there is \co{more} thanwhat one, at any time, can see here and now.  \citet{[Y]et there be those who  imagine they have positive ideas of infinite duration and space.  It would, I  think, be enough to destroy any such positive idea of infinite, to ask him  that has it,-- whether he could add to it or no; which would easily show the  mistake of such a positive idea.}{LockUnd}{II:17.13. We have to ignore here  that Locke is speaking about infinity of time and space -- the same argument  was used against any idea of actual infinity.}  Although there is nolimit, yet one \co{actuality} can always become next one; one can always add 1to whatever is there already. We never arrive at anything, but as usual in suchcases, we obtain (or rather \co{posit}) a shadowy regulative idea, thepossibility of indefinite progression, which in this case amounts tounboundedness, i.e., potential infinity.\wtsep{act. infty}Various forms of rationalism used to be less reductionistic than empiricismand showed in general more liking for actual infinity.  The following might bealmost a direct answer to Locke: \citet{if an infinite line be measured out in  foot lengths, it will consist of an infinite number of such parts; it would  equally consist of an infinite number of parts, if each part measured only an  inch: therefore, one infinity would be twelve times as great as the other.  --  [...]  all these absurdities (if absurdities they be, which I am not now  discussing), from which it is sought to extract the conclusion that extended  substance is finite, do not at all follow from the notion of an infinite  quantity, but merely from the notion that an infinite quantity is measurable,  and composed of finite parts; therefore, the only fair conclusion to be drawn  is that infinite quantity is not measurable, and cannot be composed of finite  parts.  [...]}{SpinozaEthics}{Note to Prop.XV}%\thi{Measurement} seems to have to do with composition of finite (and discrete)parts, in fact with successive progression. The conclusion is then that such aprogression does not lead to any infinity for infinity turns out to beincompatible with \thi{measure}. It is present \la{a priori} or it is neverreached in any way. \wtsep{pot. founded on act. infty}\pa Now, we do not intend to review the history of the conflict of actual vs.potential infinity, because most of the involved arguments can be easilydismissed once we have the precise concepts of infinity andcardinality.\ftnt{Dedekind's definition (a set is infinite iff it is equinumerous  with its proper subset) makes Locke's argument above obsolete, or rather simply  wrong; while Cantor's  calculus of cardinalities shows that the intuitions about number of elements  in finite collections often do not generalise to infinite sets (already for  the least infinite cardinal $\aleph_0$, we have $\aleph_0+\aleph_0=\aleph_0$;  so, for instance, $12\cdot\aleph_0=\aleph_0$). One can admire Spinoza's foresight  that such apparent absurdities, perhaps, are not absurdities.  He nevertheless uses them as such to dismiss the idea of measuring the  infinite. As often happens, an acceptable argument can serve to support a  wrong conclusion.}Indeed, philosophers seem to be less occupied with infinity sincemathematicians got the control over the concept. We know that infinity isirreducible to progress (actual infinity irreducible to potential one), andthose who do not like it may simply refuse to deal with infinity at all but notclaim any reduction.\ftnt{One can obtain some sub-branches of mathematics, but these are only sub-branches. Intuitionism is a strong example, but likewise Hilbert's program of finitariness, and then also the theory of computability are  expressions of this potent idea of the early XX-th century's \ger{Zeitgeist} of  finitude and discretisation.}  Technically, this irreducibility is reflectedby the need for axioms of infinity -- in set theory, the axiom \wo{There exists  an infinite set}, but also in Euclid, the axiom \wo{Any line can be prolonged  indefinitely.}In the case of continuum, any use of progression is known as, at best, a wayof approximating the actual results. But we do not intend any review. The crucial point is that although the conceptsand understanding of infinity have reached a very sophisticated stage, they havebeen discussed for millennia -- perhaps, in a confused manner, but on the purelyintuitive basis.  No matter the concepts, one has always taken recourse tosomething like infinity -- perhaps only an idea, perhaps not, butsomething\ldots Even the mere unboundedness of indefinite progression is alreadythe idea of actual infinity in disguise -- it is infinity reduced by theepistemological scepticism to \co{actuality}.\noo{FTNT. The distinction between  infinite and unlimited in mathematics is, of course, a mathematical  distinction which may but need not be referred back to the pre-mathematical  intuitions.}  The fact that from a finite set of observations we neverthelessmake the spring to the potentially infinite indicates, in a manner of theontological proof, that the infinite is there already. All the emphasis one hasto put on \wo{potentially} (while, so to speak, the unfortunate word\wo{infinite} sneaks in through the back-door), like all too insistent a need todeny something, suggests the \co{presence} which only one's bias tends to label \wo{unreal}.Potential infinity is only a conceptual reduction of actual infinity to theepistemic \hoa. But infinity, the actual infinity itself, is \co{founded} in the \co{chaos} \co{above} \co{experience} and in the eventual\co{transcendence} of \co{nothingness}.%This \co{experience}, or rather, this \co{aspect} of\co{any experience}, the \co{chaos} viewed as \co{chaos} of \co{puredistinctions}, is what \co{founds} the immediate intuition of the\thi{largest possible} multiplicity, of the \thi{totality of everything},\citet{maximum beyond which there can be nothing greater.}{DDI}{I:2.5}\wtsep{apeiron}\pa The experiential \co{foundation} knows \nexuss\ but not necessarily all thedistinctions which are so dear to later \co{reflection}.  The Greek\gre{apeiron} can be and is translated {\em either} as \thi{infinite} {\em or}as \thi{indefinite} {\em or} as \thi{unlimited}, and we mean {\em all} thesewhen speaking about \co{foundation} of the idea ofinfinity.\ftnt{\citefi{[Earth's] part beneath goes down to    infinity.}{Xenophanes}{ DK 21B28}\kilde{Xenophantes, fr. 28; Strabo I    [Presocratic Philosophers [Eivind's], no.3, p.10]} \citefi{The unlimited is    the original material of existing things [...

Unlimited still  lacks the distinction of infinity, it is that which transcends, goes beyond  but not into any infinity -- perhaps, into a big void, but archaic outside  (let's say, \gre{apeiron}) is neither infinite nor unbounded, neither  potential nor actual, but just that which terminates any questioning,  \co{indistinct} source.  \thi{Unlimited} (perhaps also \thi{endless}) may and  often still does mean unlimited without meaning infinite. But it is very close  to that which surpasses all possible limits. This is the final  \co{actualisation} which brings in the infinity -- the horizontal projection  of the unlimited, an \co{actual} expression of the \co{transcendence} which  has become a mere totality of \co{actualities}.  Potential infinity is the  event of further \co{reflection} which insists on the primacy, perhaps even  the only \thi{reality}, of the \hoa\ and \co{immanent} contents.}%%Infinity, in particular discrete, countable infinity is the final\co{actualisation}, an \co{actual} expression of the \co{transcendence} whichhas become a mere totality of \co{actualities}. It is the horizontal projectionof the unlimited/ubounded/infinite which are so many ways of \co{representing}the \co{indistinct}, \thi{everything}.  Potential infinity arises as a still further\co{reflection} which insists on the primacy, perhaps even the only\thi{reality}, of the limited \co{actuality}. \wtsep{math}A \co{reflection} of the original \gre{apeiron}, as the \co{chaos} whichunderlies every experience, will be present in one way or another in everyoriginal mathematical intuition.  Its mathematical counterpart will varydepending on the level of sophistication of the mathematical apparatus. It maybe \thi{3}, or \thi{more than 3}, \thi{many} or \thi{infinity}.  The most recentversion seems to be the \thi{totality of all mathematical objects}. Having tamedinfinities, Cantor retained the intuition that the universe of {\em all} suchobjects can not possibly be a mathematical object, which was a premonition offuture problems.  The paradoxes of the \thi{set of all sets} can now be renderedmathematically manageable (e.g., by restricting the axiom of comprehension, oras in various axiomatisations of classes, or by whatever other means), but thetrick is always to exclude the \thi{totality of everything} from theconsideration -- whatever we cannot speak about, does not cause trouble.  Butwhether represented within or expelled from the formal system, the totality keepsalways pointing to the same intuition of the eventual \co{transcendence}, of the\co{indistinct} limit of \co{distinctions}, and reminding, along the lines ofthe first antinomy, that the limit of the world does not belong to the world.\wtsep{geom}\pa The ineradicable presence of infinity can be better seen on the example ofgeometry.  We started with the intuition of a point which was equated with the(intuition, respectively \co{representation} of) \co{pure distinction}.  Butpoints do not appear alone.  Even if point's counterpart is residual\co{objectivity}, the \thi{mere being} in the \co{immediacy} of the\co{reflection that it is}, such a \co{reflection} is also immediately aware ofthe \co{transcendent} horizon surrounding its \co{actuality} -- positing apoint, it posits an \co{actual} multiplicity of points.  Sure, we can\co{reflectively dissociate} an \co{act} of imagining a point, from an \co{act}imagining a multiplicity of points. But this is only \co{reflective  dissociation}. A point appears always \thi{surrounded} by a background, evenif this be only a black, undifferentiated something -- shall we say, space?  --against which the point is imagined.\ftnt{Here, space may be understood not only  as \co{spatiality} -- simultaneity of \co{distinctions}  (I:\ref{sub:spatialityBeforeTemporality}), but rather as the background from  which the \co{distinctions} emerge.  It does remind about Kantian space as the  \la{a priori} form of intuition.}  They emerge only against thisundifferentiated background, and here \wo{undifferentiated} means continuous.Points represent thus a discretisation of continuity, of a continuity whichtranscends the points of \co{distinctions}, that is, of an actually infinitecontinuity. But while the primordial infinity of this continuous background isactual infinity, so the multiplicity of points gives rise to potential infinity:no matter how many points are (imagined, posited, thought to be) there, there isalways a possibility of \thi{extracting} more points from the undifferentiatedbackground.  Once we have a point, we have not only a multiplicity, but aninfinity of points.  For an \co{actual} point (whether imagined or drawn) isonly a sign of a \thi{point which already was there}, it merely marks the focusof our attention.  Imagining a space, say, a plane, and \thi{putting} a point on(or rather, \thi{extracting} a point from) it, the important thing is not {\em  where} we \thi{put} it but that it can be \thi{put} {\em anywhere}. This is,in one, actual infinity and continuity (of course, not in the technical sense),the pure heterogeneity of \co{chaos} in the immediate neighborhood of\co{indistinct one}.Geometry, which with its points and planes gives the primordial intuition ofcontinuity, is also the first stage where the duality of discrete-continuousarises.  The duality forms, as Brouwer put it, \thi{two-oneness}.  After the\co{distinctions} have occurred it becomes perplexing to decide whethercontinuum consists of parts or not, whether things are infinitely divisible ornot, whether infinite series can sum up to finite magnitudes and whetherAchilles will ever catch up with the tortoise -- whether \co{one} is a\co{chaotic totality} of many or else whether \co{chaotic} many is really \co{one}.\wtsep{}\pa\label{pa:arithgeom} The differences between geometry (which starts withinfinity of \co{pure distinctions}, discrete points on a continuous backgroundand, shortly after, with the axiom of actual infinity) and arithmetics (whichstarts with multiplicites of \co{pure distinctions}, for which potentialinfinity is a theorem, and which only after long labour arrives at the continuumof real numbers), interesting as they might be, are not essential for us, becausethey involve us already into a consideration of foundations, if not ofmathematics itself.  Like the distinctions of actual vs. potential infinity,infinity vs. unboundedness, infinite time vs. infinite space, etc., it onlywitnesses to the multiplicity of possible ways of reflecting the origin,possible ways of \co{actually} relating \co{pure distinctions} to each other andto the \co{indistinct} background from which they emerge.\noo{ %perhaps, expand...\pa It seems easier to grasp potential rather than actual infinity, for even if\thi{everything} happens to be actually infinite, its inaccessibility turns itimmediately into a merely epistemic potential.  Although easier to grasp, theidea of potential infinity is more elaborate and sophisticated than that of theactual infinity, for the former involves the actual finitude (of\co{reflection}, of epistemic subject) which is not involved in the latter.It seems easier to grasp a discrete structure, a few finite numbersthan the continuum, the calculus of infinitiesAll these \wo{easier to grasp} express the same reductive character -- ofontology to epistemology, or as we say, of \co{invisible} to \co{visibleactuality}. As usual, \co{reflection} (and here we might say also: mathematicalreflection) starts at the lowest level of \co{actuality} -- \wo{the way up isthe way down}, or as Aristotle would say, the ontologically last is theepistemologically first. Mathematical reflection never leaves this sphereBeginning of \co{reflection} is only the end of \co{foundation}, and to forget the \co{origin} is to reduce.(Reduction amounts to more elaborate ideas and explanations -- it increases complexity of the whole, even if it manages to reduce some basic notions.) } %end \noo{ perhaps expand\subsection{A note on foundations}\label{sub:foundations} What makes mathematics is not its mere origin and the mere \co{pure distinctions},but a structure and relations built on the top of these basic intuitions.The ordering or, at first, only the two-term relations \thi{less than},\thi{equal to}, \thi{more than}, arise from a particular way of relating themultiplicites of various \co{actualities}.  Structures proper to mathematics arefounded on \co{actual reflections} of such relations.  These\co{representations} can proceed in different directions and lead to differentfoundations, not to mention different branches of mathematics.  It is not ourobjective to review the historical schools of foundations but we will give a fewshort examples and remarks illustrating how the origin from \co{pure distinctions} is reflected when forming various foundations.\pa \wo{[A] universe comes into being when a space is severed or taken apart.  The skin of a living organism cuts off an outside from an inside. So does the  circumference of a circle in a plane. [...] The act [of original severance] is  itself already remembered, even if unconsciously, as our first attempt to  distinguish different things in a world where, in the first place, the  boundaries can be drawn anywhere we please.} This quotation from theintroductory Note on The Mathematical Approach in \citeauthor*{LawsForm}, shouldbe self-explanatory at the present point. Starting with the space, \esp, inwhich a distinction is (to be) made, \setlength{\unitlength}{.1cm}\dist, and postulating two laws, that i)drawing the same distinction twice makes no more distinction than drawing itonly once, \dist\dist=\dist, and that ii) crossing a boundary of a distinctionand then crossing it back amounts to no distinction, \twice=\esp, and applyingthese equations as rewrite rules to various combinations of distinctions, thebasic laws of arithmetics, algebra and propositional logic are derived which,although do not develop the full mathematics, make the possibility of such adevelopment at least plausible. The texts on foundation of mathematics and, ofcourse, \citet{mathematical texts generally begin the story somewhere in the  middle, leaving the reader to pick up the thread as best he can. Here the  story is traced from the beginning.}{LawsForm}{p.xxix} One can, of course,discuss the laws and the details of the development, but the presentation is themost accurate expression of the idea of actually founding mathematics on\co{pure distinction} alone. The reader is referred to this book which, if itcan appear a bit esoteric and idiosyncratic, so only because it has beenundeservedly and unjustly ignored.\pa\label{pa:categories} A much more successful story, at least from the pointof view of scientific development and fashion, can be told about categorytheory.\ftnt{A very simple introduction, accessible even to a person with only  basic knowledge of set-theory, is \citeauthor*{Lawvere}. The origins go back  to 1940-ties, and \citeauthor*{MacLane} is the standard reference.}  Itsinitial motivations, as well as the subsequent focus and power, lie in theability to capture structural aspects at a high level of abstraction (oftenreferred to, by other mathematicians, as \wo{general abstract nonsense}).Category theory assumes, as it were, given multiplicities and studies theirrelations. In fact, it does not even assume multiplicites but just arbitraryobjects whose properties are determined exclusively by their mutual relations(morphisms between the objects, required to satisfy only a few simplepostulates). It is only morphisms, and not any internal structure of theobjects, which account for all the differences between the objects.\ftnt{As a   simple example, consider the standard Cartesian product  $A_1\times A_2$ of sets $A_1$ and $A_2$ -- it is the set of all ordered pairs  $\langle a_1,a_2\rangle$ where $a_1\in A_1$ and $a_2\in A_2$. In set theory,  we are given an explicit construction of a particular object. In category  theory, one defines a product $A_1\otimes A_2$ of two objects, as {\em any}  object with two morphisms, \wo{projections}, $\pi_i:A_1\otimes A_2\rightarrow  A_i$ satisfying the universal property that for every object $B$ with two  morphisms $\phi_i:B\rightarrow A_i$ there exists a {\em unique} morphism  $u:B\rightarrow A_1\otimes A_2$ such that $u;\pi_i=\phi_i$.  One verifies  that, for instance for the category of sets and functions, the Cartesian  product $A_1\times A_2$, with $\pi_i$ being the $i$-th projection, satisfies  the categorical definition. But so does also, for instance, the isomorphic  object $A_2\times A_1$ (now with $\pi_1:A_2\times A_1\rightarrow A_1$ being  the second projection, and $\pi_2$ the first one.) In the category of  propositions with the logical consequence relations as morphisms, the same  definition of categorical product, now applied to two propositions $A\otimes  B$, turns out to be the conjunction $A\land B$ (or anything logically  equivalent, e.g., $B\land A$).} In this way,if we allow the interpretation of morphisms as \thi{observations} (or just\thi{source of distinctions}), category theory exemplifies the observationalapproach (which, as discussed in \refppf{ft:identidiscern} in connection withidentity of indiscernibles, is a variant of distinguishability).  Indeed,objects obtained by all categorical constructions are determined only up to\thi{indistinguishability}, that is, up to isomorphism.\ftnt{Various strict  versions are studied but they represent only special cases. Identity still  plays the important role but only when applied to morphisms, that is,  \thi{observations}.}  The theory by far exceeds in mathematical generality andsophistication intuitionism which degenerated the notion of \thi{observability},or intuition, to finite constructiblity.\noo{Paradoxically, at least if we were  to take the name \wo{intuitionism} seriously, it not only yields some~\ldots  well, \wo{counter-intuitive} results but also finds most applications as far  from intuition as the theory of computation.}  (Incidentally, the ghost of\thi{category of all categories} haunts the theory just as the \thi{set of all  sets} haunts early set theory. As the definition of a category starts with two{\em collections} -- of objects and morphisms -- the foundational problems seemto lead back to those familiar from the set theory.)% \pa\label{pa:categories}% In ``Conceptual Mathematics'' W.~Lawvere begins in a way more% similar to \refp{pa:numbers} in that he assumes given% multiplicites.% Given two multiplicites, $A$ and $B$, the most elementary thing one% can do with them is to form some relation.  This relation may be% arbitrary, e.g., relating any point of $A$ with a designated point of% $B$, relating points \thi{at random}, etc..  But there are easily% recognised ways of relating which soon turn out to give most structure% to the emerging relations.  If it is possible to find an injective% function from $A$ to $B$, it tells that $A$ has at most as many points% as $B$ -- it has a smaller number or, perhaps in a more abstract% sense, is a subobject of $B$.  If it is possible to find a surjective% function from $A$ to $B$, then it amounts to partitioning $A$ into% disjunct subsets, each determined by the unique point of $B$ to which% all its elements are mapped.  In other words, it amounts to% classifying points of $A$ according to the \co{disitinctions} (points)% of $B$.% Thus, categorical foundation starts rather with \co{actual}% multiplicites and relations (morphisms) between them.\ftnt{Even if% the formal example throughout the whole book is the category of sets,% the categorical foundation represents a significant departure from the% tradition of set theory in that one does not any longer attempt to% construct the universe of sets but takes it (as any other category)% for given and instead develops all concepts in terms of relations% between objects.}% %% This is still good and fine, because the question remains:% multiplicites {\em of what}?  In category theory they will often be% multiplicites of arbitrary, possibly highly structured, objects.  But% the \co{pure distinctions} remain.  For the first, the objects will% almost always be mathematical objects, that is, objects described% (even if not exhaustively characterised) by means of familiar% mathematical constructions.  It is only their characterisation which% is transfered from the internal structure to the properties% expressible exclusively in terms of the relations.  These relations% (of which surjective, injective, etc.  functions are but trivial% examples, which have their categorical counterparts) still have to be% reducible to univocal mathematical definitions -- identity plays the% paramount role precisely with respect to relations rather than% objects.\ftnt{But we should observe that the categorical \thi{way% of thinking} is not necessarily limited to mathematics.  The examples% used by Lawvere are excellently chosen from the daily experience.  A% sociologist may study phenomena exclusively in terms of their external% relations, just as behaviourist does.  Of course, the kinds of% relations, and the kinds of \co{distinctions} between phenomena will% be then of entirely different order than in the mathematics of% category theory.% In this \thi{observational} approach (cf.  \refpp{ft:identidiscern})% to mathematics, \thi{observations} mean simply relations between% objects and are fully internalised.  Identity plays the important role% when applied to the morphisms, but the constructions which yield% objects are defined only up to \thi{indistinguishability}, that is, up% to isomorphism.  The theory by far exceeds in mathematical generality% and sophistication intuitionism which degenerated the notion of% \thi{observability}, or intuition, to finite constructiblity. % (Paradoxically, at least if we were to take the name \wo{intuitionism}% seriously, it not only yields some ...  well, \wo{counter-intuitive}% results but also finds most applications as far from intuition as the% theory of computation.)  There is a vast variety of more specific% examples of the \thi{observational} approaches, including% observational logics, pointfree topology, theory of locales, various% properties of extensionality, i.e., of identity of indiscernibles.}% %% (Incidentally, the ghost of \thi{category of all categories} haunts % the theory just as the \thi{set of all sets} haunts early set theory. % The foundational problems seem to reduce to those familiar from set % theory.\ftnt{The standard reference is Saunders Mac Lane, % {\em Categories for the Working Mathematician}, and one better be % mathematician if one intends to read it.})\pa The best known and most thoroughly studied foundation of mathematics is settheory. Its fundamental primitive concept of a set connects it to the origin.For Frege a set seemed to be an extension of a concept, but this is a heavilylogicist position influenced, as it seems, by the search for empiricalfoundations. To begin with, it was much simpler: \citet{a set is a many which  can be thought as a one.}{CantorGes}{p.204. Or in an earlier formulation:  \citef{In refusing to allow the manifold to remain manifold, the mind makes    the truth clearer; it draws a separate many into one, either supplying unity    not present or keen to perceive the unity brought about by the ordering of    the parts.}{Plotinus}{VI:6.13} Introducing, as Cantor did, actually infinite  sets amounts to following this intuition of the possibility of \thi{being    thought as one} all the way through, and has the obvious relation to the  (neo-)Platonic creed of unity preceding multiplicity, invoked in  \citeauthor*{CantorAggr}, e.g., \citeauthor*{Plotinus}{ V:6.3;VI:6.11},  \citeauthor*{Proclus}{ \para 69} (cf. I:\ref{sub:OneMany}).  \noo{[The same    intuition of a unity of a multiplicity, though degenerated and limited to    finite sets only, appears some 500 years earlier: \citef{Now multiplicity,      if it is finite, is not entirely outside the confines of unity, since      insofar as it is finite it is one.}{PicoUnity}{VI}]}}Notice how the word \wo{many} suggests the irrelevance of any actual contentsfor the considered multiplicity, which is to be given in the simultaneous\co{immediacy}, is to \wo{be thought as a one}. Cantor attempted alternative formulations -- \citet{by a set we are to understand any collection  into a whole of definite and separate objects of our intuition or of our  thought}{CantorCont}{\kilde{p.84} [also in \citeauthor*{CantorGes}, p.282]}-- and one can certainly recognise here the importance of having \thi{sharp and  separate} objects as members.\noo{ (which might be quoted as a justification  for, say von~Neumann-Bernays-G\"{o}del axiomatisation of classes, forbidding  them to be members of other classes due to their \thi{unsharp} character  caused by unmanageable size)} But the basic intuition remains unchanged,namely, the intuition of a multiplicity, of a collection of \co{precisely}distinguished somethings, in general \co{objects} or mathematical objects but,eventually, only of \co{pure distinctions} which are \co{posited} simultaneouslyas an \co{actual} unity.\ftnt{In Fraenkel's set theory with \ger{Urelemente},  different \ger{Urelemente} were distinct but indistinguishable (any  permutation of \ger{Urelemente} could be extended to an automorphism of the  whole universe). The formulation \wo{distinct but indistinguishable} might  cause some worry, but to us seems a perfectly reasonable expression of the  idea of \co{pure distinction}, \co{distinction} without any content or prior reason.}Unlike category theory which studies properties of objects only to the extentthey are reflected in the {\em relations between} the objects, much of thefoundational effort in set theory went on actually constructing the universe ofsets. Even in such a construction, which does not presuppose any givenmultiplicites, we can find \co{pure distinction} as the fundamental buildingblock. The construction starts with nothing, emptiness, that is, with the emptyset.  But is not there a difference between nothingness and a set which containsnothing? The former is, perhaps: \esp, while the latter: $\{\esp\}$ (writtenusually $\emptyset$). This, one could say, is only the matter of notation, ofthe need to indicate emptiness. But it is much more.  There is a differencebetween nothingness and nothingness captured, between emptiness and emptinessconfined, emptiness of a particular container, between nothingness and a setcontaining nothing. The pair of parentheses $\{\ \}$ applied at this verybeginning reflects the \co{pure distinction}, the fact of difference which hasbeen extracted from nothingness; we could almost say, an \co{act} of\co{actually} addressing nothingness as distinct from the unaddressednothingness itself. This \co{actuality} brings at once also the intuition ofmultiplicity, of a simultaneous givenness of \co{pure  distinctions}.  For once the pair -- the \co{act} -- $\{\ \}$ is there, it canbe applied to everything (even to nothing) and thus the rest follows.  The only set we canobtain at the next stage from $\emptyset$ is $\{\emptyset\}$ -- the setcontaining one element, the empty set $\emptyset$.  Of course, $\emptyset\not=\{\emptyset\}$ -- the set $\emptyset$ has no elements, while$\{\emptyset\}$ has one.  We can then continue adding the parentheses, obtainingnew, mutually distinct sets $\emptyset \not= \{\emptyset\} \not=\{\{\emptyset\}\}\ldots$ This looks boringly similarto unary numbers and, moreover, produces different sets only in so far that theyall contain different elements -- but they all (except $\emptyset$) containexactly one element.  This does not open up for internalising mathematics, inparticular arithmetics, {\em within} the set theory, so one has to show moreingenuity (as is done in von Neumann's construction of ordinals).\noo{Having  constructed the first two sets, one can make a new set with two elements --  $\{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}$.  The only thing needed (and here explicitly  constructed using $\{\ \}$) is that the elements of such a two-element set are  mutually distinct.  Having that, that is, three distinct sets/elements, we can  construct a set with three elements by putting $\{\ \}$ around, $\{\emptyset,  \{\emptyset\}, \{\emptyset,\{\emptyset\}\}\}$, etc.  In short, having  constructed a set $\alpha_{i}$, we can in a generic way construct \thi{the    next} set $\alpha_{i+1}$, distinct from all previous and with one more  element than $\alpha_{i}$, by letting  $\alpha_{i+1}=\alpha_{i}\cup\{\alpha_{i}\}$.  We do not have to review here  the details and consequences of this elegant construction of ordinals proposed  by von Neumann nor various axiomatisations of set theory.  The essential  aspect is already there -- the rest, possible axioms and postulated  constructions, in particular, also the above construction of ordinals, is a  matter of foundation.} But the main point has already been made -- enough\co{distinctions} are available and they are obtained from the original $\{\ \}$which represents both \co{pure distinctions} {\em and} theirsimultaneity. The rest -- possible axiomatisations, postulated constructions,resolution of appearing paradoxes -- is a matter of more detailed foundation.\noo{ The set formation using $\{\ \}$ reflects, as just observed, also the  other aspect besides that of \co{pure distinction}, namely, that of pure  multiplicity, simultaneity. A set of three elements amounts to mutual  \co{distinctions} between the elements which are given simultaneously, in the  unity of one \co{act}. A set represents an \co{actuality}, and it is only  understandable that it has been for so long quite difficult to admit infinite  sets as legitimate objects of mathematical discourse.  }%\newpa %\tsep{identity:consider shortening/moving to \ref{sub:Identity}}\pa One final remark before leaving the subject of foundation. Sameness iscomplement of distinctness so, instead of saying that mathematics is the scienceof \co{pure distinctions} we might, perhaps, say that it is the science ofequality (or even identity).  It might be an exaggeration to claim that identityis the only form of mathematical theorems, but it is certainly the basic form ofmathematical statements.Equality arises as a special case of relation between multiplicities, namely,when we find a function which is bijective. Equipotence of $A$ and $B$ is the first moment when equality enters the stage ofexplicit representation. But implicitly it has been there earlier. The very factof relating some point $a$ of $A$ with a point $b$ of $B$ means, in a sense,identification. If $r$ relates $a$ with $b$, especially, if the relation $r$ isfunctional, it amounts to saying that the image of $a$ under $r$ is, i.e., isequal to $b$, $r(a)=b$. It depends, of course, on what $r$ is. Our shepherd didnot identify sheep with marks on the stick. But establishing a(n injective)function amounts to identifying the points of the source with their images.Equality emerges as a relation -- that is, it presupposes and is based on\co{distinction}. Nobody would ever imagine saying that $a=a$ if the threatof $a\not=a$ was not there.\noo{(It was the fear, the intuition, the suspicion ofthe non-identity of the underlying \co{non-actuality} which drove one todesperately emphasize the \co{actual}, empty law of $x=x$.)} This possibilityis, from the point of view of pure multiplicites and theirrelations, the primordial reality: \co{immediate} things, viewed {\em only} fromthe point of their \co{immediacy}, are different before they become the same.\noo{MOVED:  Identity arises as a relation across multiplicites, where a point $a$ in $A$turns out to be the same as $b$ in $B$.  As Frege observed, the differencebetween $a=a$ and $a=b$ concerns the form of presentation. Just like thestatement $a=a$ does not say anything, the statement $a=b$ says quite a lot --their \ger{Erkenntniswert} is very different. The former \citet{is valid a priori  and, following Kant, is called analytic}{FregeSinn}{}. The latter, on theother hand, says that $A$ and $B$ are two different perspectives, two differentsnapshots of something.  This something, this ever transcendent $x$, arisesprecisely as the identity of $a$ (i.e., $x$ viewed as, or in the context of, $A$)and of $b$ (i.e., $x$ viewed as, or in the context of, $B$).\ftnt{Frege says that  $a$ and $b$ are simply different signs and that identity is an epistemic  relation between signs, which obtains when both have the same denotation,  \ger{Bedeutung}. This is probably what it becomes, eventually, in the  \co{actual world} with its ready-made \co{objects}. Our point here is only  that this relation is \co{founded} and emerges as a residual \co{trace} in the  process which first   \co{dissociates} various \co{actualities}, and then must re-establish the  connections between them. The present remarks give only the observations from  Section~\ref{sub:Identity}, in particular \refpf{actId}, a more specific form.}}Of course, this \thi{becoming the same} has only epistemic aspect becauseproving that $a=b$ one only discovers the fact, an $x$, hiding behindthe actual representations $a$ and $b$, and which has always made $a=x=b$.  As weobserved in \ref{sub:Identity}, especially \refpf{actId}, equality across\co{dissociated actualities} is a transcendent fact, a \co{trace} of earlierunity.  This fact cannot be accounted for within the mere \co{actuality} andidentity remains, on the one hand, a hardly questionable (ontological) intuitionand, on the other hand, an (epistemic) ideality which \thi{has to be  constructed}.  Likewise in mathematics,\noo{ which is the science of pure  \co{immediacy},} this relation remains forever as fundamental as undefinable.On the one hand, equality is not axiomatisable -- any set of axioms valid forthe identity relation will also be valid for other relations (congruences, i.e.,indistinguishabilities).\ftnt{This applies to first-order logic. In a sense, but  only in {\em a} sense, second-order logic allows one to define identity, i.e.,  force a relational symbol to be interpreted as such. The reservation concerns  the need for additional semantic assumptions, in particular, that one works  only with the standard model (all subsets of the domain) and not the general  models (admitting various choices of the collection of subsets). Then, the  definition of identity of individuals amounts to requiring them to be members  of exactly the same sets, in particular, the same sets with only one element.  Even if technically possible, it seems to leave too many holes (e.g., sameness  of all, also one-element sets is presupposed) for a philosopher to agree that  identity has thus been defined.}As Frege says \wo{Since every definition is an  identity, identity itself can not be defined.}  But, axiomatisable or not, oneworks with equality and knows its meaning. Equality is a semantic notion: it hasto be introduced into the mathematical foundation as a primitive, as if\thi{from outside}.\noo{, and can, at best, be reflected by the machinery of  multiplicites and their relations. This semantic notion allows one to extend  the scope of other notions, to transcend their validity and relevance beyond  the initial \co{immediacy}. Eventually, it relates the units of knowledge and  \co{distinctions} of \co{representation}, reflecting the possibilities of  viewing {the same} as different without forgetting that one is viewing the  same\ldots} This is yet another reflection of the \co{purity} of the addressed\co{distinctions} which are given, always and only, in the sphere of timeless\co{immediacy}. In this sphere, everything is \co{dissociated} to the extreme,everything is but an \co{immediate} point \co{purely} and absolutely\co{distinct} from all the others. Equality of two such \co{distinctions} entersthe sphere as a transcendent event, connecting the \co{immediacy} of $a$ withthe \co{immediacy} of $b$ which connection, ideally, should be equally\co{immediate}. But, strangely, $b$, appearing as distinct from $a$, must residein some other place, and their equality is what connects these two places. Oncethe equality is established, the two become one, \co{immediate} $x$ ($=a=b$which becomes likewise the mere, \co{immediate} self-identity $x=x$). But the very event of this \thi{becoming one} happens elsewhere, in the spheretranscending their \co{immediacy}. Whether one calls this sphere \wo{the mindof the working mathematician}, \wo{the mathematical activity} or else \wo{theeternal world of ideas}, we leave to everybody's discretion. Our point is only that ittranscends the sphere \co{immediacy} where the equated objects of mathematicshave their \la{locus}. \noo{ Intuition of this fact might have been one of the motivations leading  Leibniz to postulate \thi{identity of indiscernibles}.  \ftnt{\label{ft:identidiscern}This principle plays crucial role whenever    one tries to get rid of all transcendence and pretend that one is in    possession of a complete logical language. Observational logics, theory of    locales, various properties of extensionality based on this principle may    have sound grounding in the formal setting where they are used.  But the same    phenomenon can be seen, in a more general context, in the attempts to reduce    all reality to language, in statements like ``Whatever can be said, has been    said'', ``Whatever we cannot speak about, we should keep silent about'',    ``Reality is the names we give to it''.        In an apparently different way, the principle appears, for instance, with    Cusanus, who says \citf{two things cannot be perfectly alike and,      consequently, participate one essence precisely and equally}{DDI, I 7/49}    Since, according to him, there is only one, infinite essence, the only    differences between things result from different degrees of participation in    this essence.  Then \citf{[t]he universe, as most perfect, has preceded all      things in the order of nature, as it were, so that it could be each thing      in each thing.}{DDI, II 5/117} The reader can easily imagine the close    analogies to the unity of the Leibniz's system, his pre-established harmony,    reflection of the whole universe in every monad, and the (resulting?)    principle of identity of indiscernibles.  A form of the principle arises    naturally not only from the attempts to reduce ontology to epistemology, but    also when considering the original unity as the most fundamental truth --    the unity which, as argued in \refsp{sub:Identity}, is not reducible to    \co{actual} observations.}  In a sense, but only in an analogical sense, the philosophy of  \co{distinctions} and \co{distinguishing} goes along with this principle:  whatever is not \co{distinguished} remains the same, remains the \co{One}.  But in our hierarchy of levels, what is the same at one level, may look quite  different at another. Identity is only, and best, a \co{reflection} of unity.  Moreover, unlike the relations between \co{actualities} where identity arises  only as a secondary concept, in the ontological order of hypostases, as well  as in the epistemological order of founding, undifferentiated unity precedes  the \co{distinctions}.  }\noo{ \pa It allows one to subsume two different \thi{perspectives}, two ways of  expression, as expressions of one and the same.  Identity as if pulls  differences into the \hoa\ where they can appear as coinciding, that is, as a  one \co{object}, even if the \co{object} itself appears only as an $x$, and  the only things we can say about it are different \co{actual} determinations.  Mathematical identity is a coincidence of different \co{actualities} within  \co{immediacy}.  It establishes something, an $x$, as that which accounts for  $a=b$, as an \co{immediacy} across the long chains of \co{actual} reasoning  steps.    Even if mathematical reasoning were a chain of tautologies\ftnt{Which it    isn't because there is no such thing as a tautology.  It is not only the    meaning of terms which might make a statement analytic.  It is also, even    primarily, the assumption that there is such a thing as an analytic    statement, which influences the way one understands the involved terms.  The    very postulate of $x=x$ being a tautology, involves already an assumption    about the entities one considers.  Certainly, $1=1$ and $2=2$ but to say    $x=x$, or more precisely, $\forall x:x=x$, is to say something not about all    possible $x$ but rather about $\forall x$, about what $x$ may range over.    As Quine points out, quantification commits one to an ontology, namely the    entities the quantified variables may range over.  The postulate $\forall    x:x=x$, that everything is identical to itself, says something about what    one understands by \wo{everything}.  It marks a narrowing of attention to    \co{objects} (or form of understanding) for which this does hold, to the    domain where it is a tautology.  Counting is good, I can count doors in my    house and women I was in love with.  But can I count the feelings which    confront me when I meet a new love?  Saying \wo{Life is identical to life}    or \wo{Love is identical to love} is, if not empty, then simply untrue.    Identity as the \co{precise} category of \co{immediacy}, does not apply at    these levels of being.  There are no two lives, no two loves which would be    identical in this rigid sense, and trying to posit them as such we have    already assumed the \co{objectivistic attitude}, we have already reduced    them to the level of \co{actuality}, to the totality of \co{actual}    observations -- in short, we have asked a wrong question.  },%  it would in no way exclude the possibility of resulting in an insight, because  such an insight would be exactly an \co{actualisation}, would reveal the  \co{actual} coincidence of the extreme terms of the reasoning chain, which to  begin with were (thought) different.  An \thi{aha!}  experience is such an  insight which occurs at the end of a chain of apparently distinct  \co{actualities} revealing that they are \co{actually} the same, that they can  be legitimately seen as one and the same thing. This identity is like a  self-sameness of a \thi{substance}, of an \co{object}, and it is what makes  the thing, the $x$, accessible within the pure \hoa\ -- $x=x$ is the ultimate  expression of focusing exclusively on such a form of accessibility.  Identity  is thus, by its very nature, transcending the \hoa. The transcendence of $x$  is just another name for the fact of $x$'s identity. One tends to think of it  as the inexhaustibility in a potentially unlimited series of \co{actual}  presentations, but it is enough to encounter the same $x$ only twice, once as  $a$ and then as $b$, to encounter its full transcendence.  Every identity is  transcendence. Both are but two aspects of this same fact; eventually, it is  the fact of everything being but a manifestation of the same and all  transcending \co{One}.    \pa Thus mathematics, with mathematical identity in particular, expresses the  tendency to consider things from the point of \co{immediacy}.  Mathematical  identity reflects also the fact of its object being transcendent. Unlike the  sentence \wo{The Morning Star is the Morning Star}, which says nothing, the  sentence \wo{The Morning Star is the Evening Star} may express a true  discovery: that two things considered distinct where only two different  perspectives on the same.  As said in I:\refp{pa:perspectives}, our  being is the \co{experience} of the \co{One} through the Many, in ever new  \co{actualities}, from ever new sides.  Identity is essentially unobservable,  since within what we take to be the horizon of observation, within the \hoa,  it may only be empty $x=x$.  But it is \co{experienced}, it is  \co{experienced} through and through, because \co{experience} is not limited  to \co{actual experiences} within this horizon.  Mathematical identity is a  reflection of this fact in terms of \co{pure distinctions} and categories of  \co{immediacy}.  }\subsection{Summarising\ldots}\co{Pure distinction} is the most \co{immediate}, because entirely contentless,event amenable to a grasp by a single \co{act} as the univocaldistinction of \thi{yes}-\thi{no}, \thi{being}-\thi{not-being}. But it is alsothe primary event of the ontological \co{founding} which,therefore, accompanies all other events. This primacy reflects the involvementinto the ultimate \co{transcendence}, the \la{a priori} of this event which, neveroccurring alone, makes possible and accompanies all\co{distinctions}. Mathematical objects have thus this double aspect: of theultimate \co{precision} and contentless univocity and, on the other hand, of the\co{representations} of the primary, though only formal, event of mere \co{distinguishing}. % a priori - but no specific form\ad{A priori} The given account can remind of Kantian \la{a priori} formsproviding conditions of possibility of experience.  \co{Distinction} is an eventof \co{any experience} and, with it, \co{pure distinction} its \la{a priori}condition.  This, however, is only an analogy of form, in that \co{pure  distinctions} play similar role to \la{a priori} forms which are notthematical contents of \co{experience} but necessary aspects underlying \co{any  experience}. But, unlike Kantian forms, they are themselves \co{experienced}in the immediacy of \co{self-awareness}, in every experience.  Beyond that, theydo not provide any more specific form of \co{experience}, in particular, thetemporal and spatial dimension are only related, but much lower \co{aspects} of\co{actual experience}.  The main difference, if we were to speak about \la{a  priori} conditions, would concern the fact that they are not independent from\co{experience} but, on the contrary, are \co{present} in every particularexperience and are themselves experienced.\noo{This difference boils down to the  difference between our generous concept of \co{experience} including also  what, without being an \co{object} of \co{any experience}, can still be  experienced, and the experience understood as merely (the totality of)  \co{actual} presentations of \co{objects}.}Even if mathematical concepts have developed, evolved and proliferated, there issomething which makes Phytagorean and modern mathematics {\em equally}mathematics.  This primal ground, reflecting its origin, has proved immutableunlike in any other science.  Learning physics we never hear about the Ionicphilosophy (misconstrued, as is typically done, as the philosophy of merenature), or of Aristotelian principles.  But learning mathematics we still gothrough the theorems of Thales, Phytagoras, Euclid which were also much earlierknown to the Babylonians or Egyptians. And also when we go back to Egyptianengineering, Chaldean astrology or Babylonian accounting, we find sound {\em  mathematical}, not pre-mathematical calculations.  As the contributions to themathematical knowledge they are as valid, relevant and {\em mathematical} as thetheorems of Gauss, Banach or Skolem.  Thus, unlike other sciences which haveeither gone through the processes of essential changes before reaching theirmodern form or else appeared only very recently, the character of fundamentalmathematical objects has remained unchanged since the very beginning. Even themost primitive and underdeveloped mathematics is {\em equally} mathematics, isas much mathematics as are its most advanced forms.  It may be less developed,have different foundations, pursue only a limited range of questions, but itcannot dissociate itself from its origin without ceasing to be mathematics.Mathematics of other intelligent beings might be very different from ours. Butto the extent it is mathematics, it would rest on the same, \la{a priori} originand, as such, could not contain theorems contradicting the theorems of ourmathematics.\newpa% no abstraction\ad{Abstraction} All other sciences emerge as a consequence of extracting fromthe whole human experience some restricted domain -- of specific objects orproblems.  The notions of such a domain may then undergo a gradual abstractionwhich eventually yields quite abstract entities with which most advancedsciences are occupied.  The abstract character of a science is always the endresult, never the beginning.  But this schema obviously does not work formathematics.  Its original objects have not changed since its beginning.  And ifwe try to elucidate the basic notions of point, number and the like by areference to the process of abstraction we would have to explain what made ourremote ancestors so intensely interested in just this line of extremeabstraction and made them ignore more or less all others. Why did Babylonians,Egyptians, Greeks carry out this line of abstraction to its very extreme whilein all other areas stopped at a very elementary level? Perhaps, simply becausenobody had to abstract himself toward the notion of a multiplicity bydisregarding more and more properties of actual objects.  If the {\em  experience} of \co{pure distinction} lies both in the background of our being{\em and} at the origin of mathematics, then there is no need to make ourancestors so mystically different from us, because there is no need forabstraction at all.\citet{[Number] may well be the most primitive element of order in the human  mind [\ldots] Hence it is not such an audacious conclusion after all if we  define number psychologically as an {\em archetype of order} which has become  conscious. [\ldots] It is generally believed that numbers were {\em invented}  or thought out by man, [\ldots but] it is equally possible that numbers were  {\em found} or discovered. In that case they are not only concepts but  something more -- autonomous entities which somehow contain more than just  quantities. [\ldots] then on account of their mythological nature they belong  to the realm of `godlike' human and animal figures and are just as archetypal  as they [\ldots]}{SynchronicityJung}{The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche,  \para 870ff.\hee{???}} In short, \wo{we have a direct awareness of  mathematical form as an archetypal structure.}$^{\ref{cit:numberArchetyp}}$Abstraction lies only in positing the original intuition of \co{pure  distinction} as an \co{object} of independent study, in turning this intuitioninto an explicit \co{representation}, if you like, in turning from the origintowards a foundation.  Thematic study of mathematics may be difficult andabstract. But it does not mean that its fundamental, original \co{object} is anabstraction which has nothing to do with \co{experience}.%syntheitc \ad{Synthetic and universal} Mathematics is not only \la{a priori} butalso \thi{synthetic} -- it applies to \co{experience}, in fact, to\co{any experience}, simply because it addresses elements present in \co{any  experience}. \co{Distinction}, \co{chaos} and \co{actuality} are constant \co{aspects}  of all our experience, knowledge andactivity.  All \co{experience} is \co{self-aware} and so with any\co{distinction} there is associated the awareness of the fact ofdistinctness, that is, \co{pure distinction}. Similarly, with the \co{actuality} of \co{an experience} there is given multiplicity, or multiplicites of \co{pure distinctions} and with \co{chaos} -- their infinity. These intuitions, even if not \co{represented} explicitly in mathematical or other concepts, accompany all our \co{experience}.But this universal applicability amounts also to a reduction. Mathematics isapplicable to \co{an experience} only to the extent we view it through theglasses of \co{pure distinctions}.  Mathematics applied to engineering, tosociology, even to psychology is always the same mathematics and it says equallymuch (or little) about each area -- it says only that much as can be expressedin terms of \co{pure distinctions}.  Counting houses is no different fromcounting sheep, nor from counting sheep and apples and friends, because countingis always only counting of multiplicites, of points, of \co{pure distinctions}.We can apply mathematics to any experience only to the extent we are willing todisregard all possible differences of content and consider only differences ofnumber. The \thi{synthetic} character of mathematical enterprise is really thesame as its \la{a priori} character -- the fact that experience is an experienceonly to the extent it is differentiated.Hence mathematics is \thi{synthetic} and truly universal: not because it can saysomething about the content of \co{any experience} but because it does not sayanything about such a content -- only that each content must be distinguished.As usual, the price for generality is the loss of \co{concreteness}.\noo{This  fact, that mathematics addresses \co{pure distinctions} and thus resides, so  to speak, in the contentless limit of \co{immediacy}, makes its objects  closely comparable to those of idealized \co{immediacy} from  \ref{sub:idealImmed}, and highly dissimilar to those of the general  experiential \co{immediacy} from the beginning of \ref{sec:levelA}. In section  \ref{sub:truth}, \refp{pa:immedSubject} and \refp{pa:immedArbitrary}, the  \co{dissociated immediacy} as the source of apparent spontaneity was mentioned  as the basis of both {subjectivity} and arbitrariness. But such  characterisations fit very badly mathematical contents. There is, however, no  problem. Firstly, because these characterisations apply only to the  experiential \co{immediacy} and not to its idealized limit. In this idealized  limit, the \co{immediacy} of a point acquires entirely \co{external}, and in  this sense \co{objective} character, retaining however the fact of  \co{immediate} givenness which is responsible for the \thi{mental},  not-experiential aspect of mathematical objects. The arbitrariness of  experiential \co{immediacy} concerns always the appearing content; \co{pure    distinction} is exactly the lack thereof and the experienced arbitrariness  of minuteness turns in the idealized limit into its opposite, necessity of the  timeless, which we will address in a moment.}\noo{%timeless  \ad{Timeless} \co{Pure distinction}, although present in every  \co{experience}, is itself liable to be grasped in the most \co{immediate}  \co{act}.  \co{Vagueness} of most \co{distinctions} is then replaced by the  sharpest, most \co{precise} rigidity of the fact of distinctness.  The whole  mathematics, arising around the \co{pure distinction}, is constructed in terms  of \co{immediacy}.  Its world is timeless in the same way as the \co{object}  of \co{reflection that it is} -- reduced to \co{immediacy}, dissociated from  the temporal dimension of existence.%\subpa  \noo{Relations between multiplicites do not have anything to do with time.    They are just relations, that is, mutual correspondences of co-\co{actual}    collections of points.  If one were to think of these in terms of processes,    then such processes are essentially reversible.  (E.g., relation $r\subseteq    A\times B$ is the same as its inverse relation $r^{-}\subseteq B\times A$;    the existence of an injective function $f:A\rightarrow B$ is the same as the    existence of a surjective function $f^{-}:B\rightarrow A$, etc.)  }%\subpa  Every mathematical relation and, in particular, mathematical identity,  although of a transcendent, supra-mathematical origin, acquires in mathematics  equally timeless character.  It is identity of two \co{immediate} givens, of  two points (or objects constructed from such points) residing in their  respective, \co{dissociated immediacies}.  Transcendent as it is, it is viewed  always and only from the point of these \co{immediacies}. The $x$ making  $a=x=b$ is itself a mathematical object which, once identified, becomes prone  to the same manipulation as $a,b$ which gave rise to it. The relation of  equality is \wo{frozen} and timeless as are the terms of this relation.  It is  the opposite of the lived, continuous \co{unity} of a being which \co{founds}  all the differences of its possible \co{actualisations}.  }\ad{Necessary vs. universal}\label{pa:necessity}It might seem that universality accounts also for necessity, that, asKant meant, ``the two are inseparable''.  But they are not onlyseparable but very different.  \noo{Let me first remark that I am not concerned with the ontological status of  necessary judgments.  I do not want to argue for nor against determinism, I  only want to observe some differences in the meanings of the two notions.  }Universality will say \wo{something is always valid}, necessity\wo{something can not be otherwise}.  The former is quite a naturalconcept.  If it is empirical, then it is exactly what makes itnatural.  To some extent everybody makes generalisations and arrivesat some universal formulations.  Now, one may say ``all ashtrays inthis room are green'' but we should not confuse the syntactic form(the mere presence of the universal quantifier) with universality. Universality involves generality and is concerned with the totality of\co{the world}.  That we always distinguish, that so it is, is auniversal statement.  But such ``so it is'' is not sufficient fornecessity because necessity is concerned not only with the actualworld but with all possible worlds.  It cannot merely say what is always thecase in \co{the world}, it also has to exclude its opposite from all possible worlds. Only by confusing the universal quantification over the objects withinthe world with the universal quantification over the possible worlds, can one confuse universality with necessity.Since universality is concerned with the actual world and necessitywith all possibilities, the former does not imply the latter. Necessity is thought {\em de re} -- it is a property of objects, relations andstates of affairs.  Saying ``this statement is necessary'' we mean ``what itclaims holds with necessity''.  It is the behaviour of objects or some state ofaffairs which is characterised as necessary. As the paradigmatic example one hasalways posited the causal relation which holds necessarily between $x$ and $y$if an occurrence of $x$ is a {\em sufficient} reason for the occurrence of $y$.After Hume's criticism it seemed impossible to maintain this idea of necessitywhich was first relegated to the categories of pure reason and, eventually, tothe sphere of purely linguistic phenomena.\ftnt{This whole development,  reflecting the atomistic ontology and leading to nominalism, is present  already in Ockham. Following the assumption of exclusive reality of  dissociated particulars, he argues for purely mental character of causality  (as of any other universal relation), \citeauthor*{OckQuod}{II:9,IV:1,VI:12},  and arrives at the impossibility of demonstrating any causal relations,  \citeauthor*{OckSent}{II:4-5.i} \citaft{GilsonHCPh}{ p.497, footnote~27}. }In this tradition, it is the analyticity of judgments which is supposed toaccount for all possible necessity -- of judgments, of course. If such judgmentsexisted they would be necessary by being void of all real content, by being truefor purely linguistic reasons of mere meaning of the involved terms.  We couldagree that necessity implies removal of the actual content but not that it is apurely linguistic phenomenon.  It is related to our understanding but not as ifthis required language and opposed \co{experience}.  It is related to all the\co{actual objects} but only to the extent these are reduced to the ideal\co{immediacy}, namely, to the contentless \co{pure distinctions}.\pa Universality involves not only \wo{for all $x$} but also a kind ofgenerality, totality of \co{the world}. Necessity, concerned with all possibleworlds, would thus imply universality. But this is only a superficial, formalimplication. Necessity does not require any generality.  ``In the experimentwhich started at the Ridiculous Labs, CA, USA, on the 26th February, at14:03':52'':18''', the generated positron had to turn left, the electron had tomake a U-turn and, colliding, they had to annihilate.''  Without making anyclaims to the physical plausibility of this statement -- it says that somethingwas necessary.  It says that no matter what, given the above conditions thingscould not have happened otherwise.  But one could hardly call it a universalstatement.  Replacing \wo{the generated positron} with \wo{any positron which  might have been generated at this point} would only change the syntax givingat most a resemblance of generality.In fact, it is only by designating more and more specific conditions, byisolating a situation or an \co{object} and excluding the possibility ofinterference from the unpredictable surroundings that we arrive at the lawswhich we consider necessary. If the result above is claimed to hold withnecessity {\em only} because there is a general law saying that any positron andany electron will necessarily annihilate under given conditions, then it is justanother level of the same -- isolating and narrowing conditions to specifysufficient reasons for some effect.  The \wo{any} may give an impression ofgenerality but it is only an impression. This apparent generality merely hidesthe highly particular definitions of electron, positron, their specificproperties, in addition to the \thi{given conditions}, to the \thi{other things  being equal} which underlies every claim to necessity.The way to necessity goes via increased \co{precision} and specialisation, i.e.,in the opposite direction than the way to universality.  The more content, theless necessity.\noo{The statement $P\lor \neg P$, when takenas a formula in propositional logic, is necessarily true. The statement\wo{Paul will visit us or not} seems to be also necessary, provided that we knowwho Paul is, who \wo{we} are and what \wo{visiting us} amounts to. The statement\wo{It is raining or it is no}, especially when \wo{or} is taken as exclusivedisjunction, has lost almost all of the assumed necessity for \wo{raining} istoo vague and ambiguous a word to admit such a bivalence.} The richer the perception of a situation, the morepossibilities it unveils, the less tractable and the more difficult to controlit becomes.  And hence the attempts to design a grand theory of everything, tosubsume the whole world under the rule of necessary laws impoverish the world.Certainly, some parts of the world can be reduced to simple entities which areprone to the descriptions in terms of the necessary. (Such descriptions seemalways to conjure the possibility of control.) But the dangerous impoverishment occurs when the drive is uninhibited, when itis the drive to defeat everything escaping control.  Only disappearance ofcontent makes perfect necessity possible.\pa The obvious attempt to obtain necessity seems thus to look for judgmentswith no content. Tautologies and contradictions were suggested but then oneshould, perhaps, include also meaningless statements having no content. Besides,%as we observed in \refp{pa:immedNexus},even the non-contradiction principle is not necessary unless one assumesappropriate reduction of the domain of discourse. This reduction goes in thedirection of \co{immediacy} and ends with mathematics. The alternative (to theanalytical necessity of empty statements) is to remove all content from theconsidered objects, leaving only the ultimate minimum of \co{precise}alternatives: \thi{yes} or \thi{no}, a \co{pure distinction}. Necessity amountsto removing possibilities and the limit of this process is when only onepossibility remains.\ftnt{Formalisations do not concern us. The fact that a  necessary fact is typically represented as obtaining in all possible worlds,  does not change its status as the {\em only} possibility. In this respect,  {\L}ukasiewicz logic of necessity, built on his three-valued logic and given  the simple truth-value semantics, represented this point in a clearer way than  the, technically perhaps more satisfying, modal logics with possible-worlds'  semantics.} But to be able to exclude possibilities with full obviousness and\co{precision}, these must be first \co{precisely} given.  Necessity ofmathematical results is only another side of their ultimate \co{precision} andis based exclusively on the character of the fundamental objects -- theultimately reduced, most \co{immediate}, entirely contentless \co{pure  distinctions}, devoid of any interfering context, in the pure isolation of\thi{all other things being equal}. The source of this necessity is the purebivalence, the ultimate \la{tertium non datur}, the absolute character ofnegation which, viewed within pure \co{immediacy}, allows two and only twoalternatives, \thi{being} or \thi{not-being}, \thi{yes} or\thi{no}.\ftnt{$7+5=12$ is, as Kant argues, synthetic ($12$ is not defined as,  nor included in, $7+5$) and necessary judgment.\kilde{CPrR,Intro:V[B];p.52}  What makes it necessarily true is not any mere linguistic convention, although  it is the meaning of the involved terms and operations. Its necessity lies in  the fact that the only other possibility, $7+5\not=12$, not only does not  obtain but also, given the (univocal and \co{precise}!) meanings of the  involved terms and operations cannot possibly obtain.  %  Of course, in more advanced constructions, several possibilities can obtain.  But even then one has the complete overview and a proof amounts to excluding  all possibilities except one. A typical mistake in a proof is overlooking one  possibility, one case which does obtain and yields another final result.    Emphasizing the fundamental role of bivalence in mathematics we do not, of  course, imply that, for instance, either continuum hypothesis or its negation  must follow from ZF(C) or that, in general, given a mathematical context every  possible question must have a unique answer. Such undetermined questions  concern advanced mathematical constructions and not the original objects with  which we are dealing here and which comprise only natural numbers and basic  geometrical intuitions. But also such advanced and undetermined questions  generate always inquiry into the conditions determining {\em uniquely} each  of the alternative answers.}Bivalent logic with non-contradiction principle, as suggested in\refp{pa:logicA}, is associated with the level of \co{immediacy} and now weencounter also necessity as yet another \co{aspect} of this \nexus. It springsfrom the idea that things could not possibly be different, the idea residing inthe residual point of \thi{now}, where there is only what there is, ultimately\co{dissociated} from the surroundings and thus as unavoidable and necessary asit is arbitrary and spontaneous. The site of necessity is \co{immediacy} andattempts to extend it beyond this narrow horizon fail rather miserably, as Humehas shown.\ftnt{Let us remember that his analyses do not affect mathematical  results. What \citef{mathematics concludes, in regard to such things as    numbers, proportions and figures is indubitably true and cannot be    otherwise}{Salisbury}{II:C.13} To the possible story-tellers, who would try  to claim that not only natural science but even mathematics is only yet  another way of telling a story, one could say that although mistakes in proofs  are possible and we may be uncertain whether a proof stretching over tens of  pages or one supported by unverified computer calculations is correct, the  mathematical result itself is always stated as necessary. Fallibility of the  \co{actual} criteria of certainty does not contradict the ultimate necessity  of the correct results.} In particular, they must first reduce the objects ofinterest to the residual points, and such a reduction is seldom satisfactory.Furthermore, most imaginable alternatives, i.e., most possible worlds arecompletely irrelevant, existentially uninteresting, and this is what makesnecessity an \thi{unnatural}, almost inhuman property.  Implausibility ofclaiming that something could not be otherwise is also the reason for the almostinstinctive rejection -- at least by the common sense -- of all sophisticatedarguments produced in favour of determinism.Mathematical statements are not empty tautologies.\noo{Perhaps, they are  tautologies, if these be defined as necessarily true statements.}  Perhaps,one could develop an apparatus making $1\not = 2$ an empty statement.  For ourpart it seems hard to imagine how one could even start doing this without theprior \co{distinction} between one $\bullet$ and another $\bullet$, without the\co{experience} (not \co{an experience}!) of $\not =$.  Mathematicalpropositions tell us the story of the objects they describe.  Their necessityfollows not from their emptiness but from the emptiness of these object.  Itdoes not hide in any formal properties of the proof techniques or particularaxiomatisations.  All such techniques have equally necessary character becausethey all have to conform to the standards of \co{immediate} univocity set up bytheir objects.  The fact that a mathematical theorem is either true or falsemimics only the contentless duality of the \co{pure distinction}.\noo{(And no  many-valued logic can change anything in this respect.  Such a logic is based  on multiplicity rather than duality of truth values and, more importantly,  (meta)theorems about such logic are usual mathematical theorems which either  hold or not.) } It is the ultimate poverty of mathematical objects whichaccounts for the necessity of mathematical truths.\pa There are degrees of approximation to pure \co{immediacy}, thatis, degrees of abstraction from the \co{concrete} content, and hence degrees ofnecessity -- objects may be more or less abstract, depending on how close theycome to the level of \co{immediacy}.  Consider the increase of the \thi{real}content in passing from mathematics to physics, then to biology, from biology tohistory, from sociology to literature.  This increase is clearly accompanied bythe decreasing degree of necessary determinations or, if you allow, by theincrease of freedom.  It is no coincidence that the scientific and philosophicalattempts to establish a system of necessary laws end up with abstractstatements.  But the statements are abstract not because they are emptytautologies -- they are abstract because they had to dispense with most of the\co{concrete} content of the described objects.  The search for the infalliblelaws leads sciences to construe their objects in a more and more simple andelementary fashion because control depends on the formulation of sufficientreasons and this sufficiency -- necessity -- requires \co{precision}, that is,approximation to \co{immediacy}, reduction of the \co{concrete} content.  It isalways as tempting to postulate necessity -- in form of sufficient reasons,binding explanations, inviolable laws of nature or reason\ldots -- as it is hard tojustify such postulates. For to justify them one has to reduce everything tosome form of mathematics.  Unfortunately, one attempts such reductions not onlyin physics or quantum mechanics but in most sciences or, at least, whattries to call itself \wo{science}.  Not only natural sciences but also economy,sociology, even psychology display the symptoms of the mathematical disease.The mathematical point, the vanishing (or rather the barely appearing)indication of something-being-there, the shadow of the perfect atom is the constantideal of the knights of necessity.\noo{ fighting the windmills of \co{vagueness}. }\noo{ Necessity, understood as {\em sufficient} condition,\ftnt{A    misunderstanding is possible here here. Necessity is related, if not    identical, to the sufficiency of some conditions, efficiency of some causes:    if $x$ occurs, then $y$ {\em must} occur, too. This is the positive schema    of necessity.  It is thus opposed to what is called \wo{necessary      conditions} which we use throughout.  But \wo{necessary condition} means    only that it is required and indispensable: if $y$ is to occur, $x$ must    occur (too, or first). Even if both \thi{musts} were analysed as exactly the    same (which easily happens if everything is reduced to a mere propositional    implication), the relation between $x$ and $y$ in both cases (or, for that    matter, between $x$ and $y$ in the first and $y$ and $x$ in the second) is    entirely different and it is the relation which occupies us.  E.g., \wo{$x$      is sufficient for $y$} and \wo{$y$ is necessary for $x$} are two    equivalent readings of the classical implication $x\rightarrow y$.  But we    do not imagine that the propositional implication \thi{$\rightarrow$} has    captured all the important aspects of anything, and such a duality between    sufficient and necessary conditions does not obtain, at least, not in our    case. Our \thi{necessary reasons} involve, in so far as they are    \thi{reasons}, some form of real precedence, either in the order of time or    of \co{founding}; while in so far as they are \thi{necessary} such a    precedence is indispensable. (One must not, however, \co{dissociate} the    two -- \wo{necessary reason} is a pleonasm, for reason without any form of    necessity is no reason.) The only form of necessity we thus get is of    negative kind: if $x$ does not happen/obtain, neither does $y$. Necessity    discussed in this section, on the other hand, is that of the    \thi{sufficient} branch.}  is an ideal limit which obtains only in the  totally univocal, because contentless, bivalence of pure \co{immediacy}, in  the realm of \co{pure distinctions}, that is, in mathematics.    That it is so natural to \thi{apply} the idea of necessity in other contexts,  even without much knowledge of mathematics, is of course due to the synthetic  character of mathematics, due to the fact that everything carries a \co{trace}  of \co{pure distinctions}. But such an application requires reduction.  }  \sep\pa \citet{[O]ur only approach to divine things is through symbols [and] we can  {\em appropriately} use mathematical signs because of their incorruptible  certitude.}{DDI}{I:11.\para 32} We can use them appropriately -- withsufficient infallibility -- because their signification is limited to the\co{immediacy} of \co{pure distinctions}, where \co{sign} and signifiedcoincide. But this appropriateness is exhausted by that.  According to HugoSteinhaus, \wo{mathematics is the science of objects which do not  exist}.\ftnt{Bovelles described creature as \citef{beings which are    not.}{Bovelles}{ p.75,97 \citaft{BogNic}{ p.91\kilde{ftnt.41}}} Misusing the  analogy of expression, mathematics applies then to all creature; to the most  fundamental, albeit very limited aspect of it.} Indeed, the limit of\co{immediacy} is the point where objects cease to exist, cease to be objectsand become mere points. Applying mathematics to anything demands that we look atthe thing as a mere pure difference, a mere point of distinction. In spite ofattempts to reduce various sciences to a mathematical dimension, we do notreally think that it is entirely meaningful to transfer the necessity andcertitude of mathematics to other domains of \co{experience}.  In fact,attempting such a reduction, we immediately realise that it is just that: areduction.  Mathematics captures and elaborates the fundamental aspect of\co{experience}, the fact of \co{distinguishing}. This may serve as a source ofpowerful analogies and useful similes.%The \thi{emptiness} of mathematical objects will always remain on the border ofmysticism and resonate deeply underneath the possible suspicions abouttautological emptiness of mathematical results. The emptiness of objectivecontent, the \co{purity} of \co{distinctions}, lifts it \co{above} all\co{experience} and makes it almost as empty as its closest neighbour,\co{nothingness} itself.%But the beginning does not contain the end, the \co{original virtuality} doesnot determine \co{actuality}.  It is not so that \citet{[b]y number, a way is  had, to the searching out and understanding of every thyng, hable to be  knowen.}{PicoConcl}{Mathematical Conclusions:11 (\la{Conclusiones de    mathematicis secundum opinionem propriam, numero LXXXV}), as quoted in  \citeauthor*{DeePref}.} Trying to \thi{Pythagorise and philosophise by  mathematics} alone ends, if not in the labyrinths of numerology, then at aphilosophical desert, as great as it is empty.
