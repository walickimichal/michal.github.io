Partiality as Nondeterminism

Y.Lamo and M.Walicki

The paper presents a new way to model undefinedness by nondeterminism: an
operation undefined on some argument is modeled as a nondeterministic
operation returning, possibly, any value of the carrier. We introduce an
institution of multialgebras MA (modeling nondeterministic operations by
set-valued functions) and illustrate the flexibility of our approach by
examples showing uniform treatment of strictness, non-strictness and various
strategies for handling errors and exceptions. We present a methodology for algebraic
specification development from an abstract specification to a low level error
handling. We relate MA to other institutions, in particular, of partial
algebras. Applying institution transformation instead of embedding leads to
the possibility of resuing partial algebra specifications in the proposed
framework -- a partial algebra specification can be conservatively
(preserving the models) imported to MA while the extension of the model class
allows for furhter development towards explicit error treatement.
