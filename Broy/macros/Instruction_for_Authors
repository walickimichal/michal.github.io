SUBMISSION INFORMATION OF THE NORDIC JOURNAL OF COMPUTING


SUBMISSIONS

To submit a paper, four copies should be sent to the Editor-in-Chief or
directly to the appropriate member of the Board of Editors (see below). 
Survey and tutorial articles should be sent to the Editor-in-Chief only.
The results of the regular papers should be new, and not under consideration
for publication elsewhere.

Papers should be written in English. Due to space shortage authors should
keep the total length to a minimum. Each paper should contain a short 
abstract, a list of key-words, and a list of classifications using 
Computing Reviews Categories. Manuscripts should be typed on only one side
of the page, double spaced, with wide margins. Figures should be drawn in
black ink or should be computer-drawn diagrams of comparable quality.

All papers will be acknowledged and refereed. Authors of published papers
will be provided with 30 free reprints. Extra reprints may be purchased at
cost price if ordered on submission of corrected proof.


ELECTRONICALLY PREPARED MANUSCRIPTS

Preparation of the manuscript in LaTeX is strongly encouraged. The editorial
decision to accept or reject a paper is, however, independent of the 
technology (computer or a typewriter) used to prepare it. A style file for
preparing the final versions of the accepted papers in LaTeX is available
from the ftp server of the journal.


COPYRIGHT

It is understood that, when submitting a paper, the authors confirm that
the submitted manuscript has not been published, nor will be simultaneously
submitted or published elsewhere. Further, if and when the article is accepted
for publication, the authors agree to the automatic transfer of copyright
to Publishing Association Nordic Journal of Computing.
